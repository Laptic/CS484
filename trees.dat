I'm picturing your uncle not only clearing his plate, but going up for seconds.  This is hilarious.
*Earlier that day...*

OP's Mom:  "Gosh darnit I'm all outta butter again!"

OP's Uncle: "Here, try some of this.  I'm sure your son wouldn't mind you used his (cough) vegan butter."
Ask how they feel between 1 and 10.
Dude, your uncle is your ally here. Fess up to him for help.

Why were you keeping cannabutter that no one knew was cannabutter in your families fridge though?
Pass the buck. "I don't know why you thought it would be a good idea to dose the whole family, Mom."

If real that's fucking hysterical. But also if real then tell them.

Sooner or later, the huge multi-national alcohol corporations like InBev are going to try to take over the weed industry in the US.  If/when they do, they can use non-neutrality to "fast track" their 'Coors Lite of weed brands' and freeze out independent growers, dispensaries and innovators.
You can use this site

https://www.battleforthenet.com

or this one

https://www.savetheinternet.com

to learn about what the battle for net neutrality is about and how you can help by calling your local representatives or putting up a banner to spread the word if you have a site etc. 

For those inside the United States:

You can text "RESIST" to 50409 to talk to a bot that will send a fax to represenatives with what you tell it to. Its best to write something you've  come up with yourself as it shows more commitment to the cause but if you can't, this is a common copy and paste letter I've seen on Reddit that you can use: 

" Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.

Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. 

Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all. "


For those of you outside the United States who want to help prevent this from happening here and potentially being adopted by other countries in the future:

you can use this site

https://www.savetheinternet.com

to sign a petition and help. If you don't know what to say, you can use the quoted section above. 

If you want to help more, you can spread these links to educate people about what net neutrality is and what they  can do to help save  it. Any and all help will make our chances of saving net neutrality higher and thank you in advance for helping!
It will be interesting to watch the rise and fall of the free internet in my life time. 

The golden age of internet freedom and unique expression is about to become a thing of the past, but fuck, the Renaissance died so it is nothing new.

1 upvote but I smoked a *bunch* of bowls
I heard drugs are bad. So I only did 1.
[deleted]
Does vaping a bowl count?

(lol of course it does)

*upvote*
Crashing the party suckers!!!!  I've smoked three joints today and I've upvoted this post! Just kidding happy 420 guys!
Dabs?
Upvote this if you smoked way more than 1
[deleted]
I can only give one updoot. Am I therefore lying? 
1 bowl sativa from a pipe in the morning.

3 bowls of a sativa dominant hybrid, earlier this afternoon. Smoked through the bong.

Plan on smoking a joint of an indica, 23% THC tonight during a Netflix binge.
Here in Florida, I got a robocall that said that legalizing medicinal marijuana would lead to pot candy being passed out to children.   Crazy.
Because Jesus would spend $850,000 to keep a plant illegal instead of, y'know, giving to the poor?
,t,,,26,,,,,,,,,e,,,,,,,,
I'm not arguing that what the Catholic Church is doing is illegal. I'm arguing that the Johnson amendment, which prohibits churches from endorsing candidates, raising money on their behalf (basically operating a church like a superpac), should be expanded to prohibit churches from endorsing or funding ballot initiatives as well. 
"The Boston Archdiocese is pouring $850,000 into a last-minute effort to defeat a state ballot measure to legalize marijuana, calling increased drug use a threat to the Catholic Church‚Äôs health and social-service programs."

Then put that 850k towards those programs.  Idiot.
As a Catholic, this sucks, and I totally agree. This is not the role of the Catholic church in society at all.
Why did they think this is okay? There is so much wrong here. 

First of all, this is $850,000 that people gave out of their own pockets, in good faith that the church would do something meaningful with it. Who approved using this money for their *agenda,* rather than what the Bible actually calls for? Those who are in tough financial situations right now can only imagine how much less stress we'd have if we could have $850,000. But it's not going to us. It's not going to the poor, the weak, the needy. It's going to some fuckin politician who already drives a $100,000 car so he can save up for another helicopter. 

Second, what right do they have to decide for or against marijuana legalization, when they actively incorporate alcohol into their sermons, what with the whole "drink the wine, eat the bread" situation? Isn't that a little backwards, especially considering people die from alcohol poisoning every day, and that it's physically addictive, whereas marijuana does not directly cause death or addiction? Couldn't that little taste of wine make a former addict break their sober streak and fall back into their sickness? If that happened with marijuana, at least it wouldn't be *deadly* if they overdo it. 

What place does the "church" have to donate such a large sum (if any) to fight the legalization of marijuana? Does it say in the Bible- "Dear leaders of the church: Instead of using donations to help the poor, sick and helpless, develope unbacked opinions of whatever you want, and use your followers' tithings to enforce said opinions. Be sure to use insane amounts that could easily go toward amazing things, such as awesome new schools for the children or warm winter clothes for the homeless." 

I like to consider myself Christian but this behavior embarrasses me to no end. It's not fair, it's not right and those at the top of this will get what's coming to them. 

Edit: Considering this comment became more popular than I expected, I want to clarify that by no means do I intend bash either Christianity or religion in general. I just wanted to voice my opinion on the church engaging in something that is so political, especially for such an ignorant cause. It's horrific. 

Edit 2: /u/RagingOrangutan has pointed out that it "isn't going to 'bribery' per se," but that most of it is going to a TV ad. I've updated my rant accordingly. 
It should be noted that organizations like NORML and MPP, which spend money to support these initiatives and pro-pot candidates are 501c3 and therefore tax exempt.  
Sugar is one of the worst drugs.
shouldn't the church be using that the help the sick, starving, homeless, poor, or otherwise "lost" souls?

I smoked a blunt instead but I upvoted. Call the cops.
Next 4/20 this sub should legit do this. Have an option for joint, blunt, bong, bowl, etc. and see what the results are.

What if I smoked multiple joints 
I smoked from my pipe instead but hey im gonna upvote anyways 

Edit: I love my pipe. [9]

[deleted]
But I can't upvote more than once, I've already killed 4 j's today. I woke up extra early to wake'n'bake

If you want to do something different also, **[find our who your representatives are](http://www.whoismyrepresentative.com)** let them know that this issue matters to their constituency. Congress(wo)men and State Reps in DC, and local state legislators as well. 

You can donate to **[the Marijuana Policy Project](http://www.mpp.org)** and/or **[the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws](http://www.norml.org)**, two amazing organizations doing local advocacy, sending lobbyists to DC and state legislatures across the country, and spreading awareness through different events. 

If you are interested in organizations that work more on the law enforcement/legal side of things, check out the **[Law Enforcement Action Partnership](http://www.lawenforcementactionpartnership.org)**. They are a national organization made up of former and current local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, judges, sheriffs, corrections officers; they advocate and speak throughout the country in favor of criminal justice reform of all stripes, with a focus on drug law reform.

(**FULL DISCLOSURE:** I am a LEAP speaker and work with MPP and NORML for local outreach events.)


These are all non-profits, and they‚Äôre all doing amazing work!
Lawyer here. I don't smoke, but I am very pro-legalization. (Come on, Maine! So close!)

This is pretty terrible. And I think it does betray *deep* hypocrisy. As well as wrongheadedness, bad science, and a total failure to prioritize the things that matter.

I do have to hope, however, that this will be **the tipping point to bring about FEDERAL LEGALIZATION.**

This is my real hope:

Act 1: Jeff Sessions cracks down on states rights.

Act 2: The US Congress finally has to STEP UP. It might not be complete legalization. But anything that allows states to 'go their own way' will be HUGE.

Act 3: Jeff Sessions does a victory lap saying "I did my duty to enforce the law, now I'll enforce the new law." Which is really annoying but I will get over it.

Act 4: Trump says "I masterminded this strategy, hurrah state's rights!" Which is really annoying but I will get over it.

Act 5: Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) says "I am so BAKED right now." And he will be. He will be crazy, crazy baked.

Act 6: The good work of legalization continues at the state level, but with far fewer impediments (access to weed for research! weed shops have access to banking! fewer people losing financial aid! FEWER BROTHERS IN JAIL!)

Act 7: I continue not to smoke because I'm boring as fuck. But I get a mad contact high off of progress and democracy.

The only way this works is if people get off their asses and do something. Call your congressperson. Call your state and local representatives. Give five bucks to NORML - or just sign up for their email blast and read their suggestions on how to help.

This might be a setback. But it could also be THE TIPPING POINT. Come on, people. We are close. We are so, so close.

EDIT: Act 8: Thanks for the gold!!!
What a dumbass, [64%+ of people approve of legalized marijuana](http://news.gallup.com/poll/221018/record-high-support-legalizing-marijuana.aspx) and it has been going up.  

Everyone on the wrong side of this one is on the wrong side of history, perpetrating the drug wars further. Horrible people.

They aren't changing anything other then where the money goes. Where do you want pot money to go the local community or cartels?
If the slightest suggestion of gun regulation results in instant, irate uproar from so many Americans ( *liberals hate freedom, Obama is coming fer ma guns! *) , there needs to be a very vocal response to this. 

Its an infringement on personal liberty, seriously economically detrimental, and above all else a very clear message that the republican party does not give a fuck what the American population wants, or what is at their best interest. 


Remember, 'this is not a war on drugs, this is a war on personal freedom'.

Edit: fixed a word 
In addition to voting, if you live in a legal state please contact your Republican senators.

Would anyone mind explaining what is going on to this non-US redditor? I was all like 'all right! Finally weed is legal, farms, tech, business is booming im moving to California!', and now it's 'weep weep you are under arrest!'

What's going on?? 
It also would be a good idea to write into or call your local representatives. They may all be corrupt and slimy politicians, but with the 2018 election around the corner and their seat possibly in jeopardy over this issue, they will listen.
Holy fuck.

We here in Canada are fully legalizing cannabis this year and the idiots in your government are cracking down on it even more. How fucking dumb is this keebler-elf looking motherfucker?
