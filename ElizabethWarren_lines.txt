aoc warren mean angry she effective and way allowed racial profiling you sexual harassment or big banks committing fraud single parents anger injustice quite appropriate 
always appreciate aoc works promote progressive wing unity mutual respect 
this cool even though endorsed bernie appreciate bust really smart trying make progressive tent bigger smaller like hillary clinton early watched series interviews aoc maybe vice the interviewer kept saying anti stuff piling she carefully steered away super impressed lucky camp take nod warren 
i've issues bernie sanders never one second aoc she's able push conversation leftward pragmatically reasonably inclusively 
jennifer rubin awful often find wondering mediocre white people get cushy jobs large newspapers spewing shitty hot takes expert opinions 
it's refreshing hear aoc talk weird elected official complete bullshit time 
pramila jayapal also tweeted something similar last night good see progressive wing finally agreement 
the time make history elizabeth warren st woman potus 
came say fallen love liz warren last night that opening bloom masterpiece honestly respect loved since first heard speak think jon stewart felt hurt bit sry sandes man wow 
aoc annoys guess good endorsement though 
aoc arguably major factor bernie well after heart attack october endorsed actively started campaigning 
warren straight beast last night it nice see fired bernie supporter goddamn amazing someone stage cut heart issue call spade bloomberg mayor pete klobuchar biden business this race warren ticket end line keep fighting good fight ladies gents real change insanely unbalanced system sight 
looking forward aoc running president 
i'm american what would aoc's political career look like congresswoman years senate 
i'm sure supporters candidate giving hard time tweeting deserves better also ever considers switching side 
hate politics warren mean angry strong passionate leader she best chance trump dems backing idk tbh shes killer goes throat every time decisive like something even republicans respect 
aoc bridge brings progressives together it way 
new york election primary voter registration deadline https voterreg dmv ny gov motorvoter april general voterlookup elections state us votersearch aspx october november 
bernie supporter also loved whole time if horse make past line candidate back kind moral fortitude 
sounds like something emperor palpitine would say ngl 
whether support warren sanders primary future aoc voters we need lead charge next generation progressives 
really wished aoc backed warren nice see 
bernie supporter donated warren yesterday debate performance think may well saved democratic party destroying bloombergs campaign she always got chills watching press bloomberg her criticism 'apology' stop frisk perfect would disappointed wh ok i'd teeny bit boy get happy progressive fighter 
damn i'm ohio mail ballot hand really thought going year vote would matter glad mark yesterday 
it's good statement fragility it moderate healthy call racist sexist 
honestly fan anger justified take i'm saying people can't upset pretending work pride wielded weapon leads easily manipulated pure zealotry it also undermines wear sleeve simply caring enough' untrue nothing aoc concerns anyone 
warren yelled loudly turned red faced flail arms around screaming whatabout people trolling campaign staff 
saw interview yesterday the view thought handled extremely well always amazed ability communicate progressive values happy warrior once warren gets nomination fantastic advocate comes time win sanders voters 
aoc bernies best surrogate unity progressive wing really hope 
progressive wing unity shouldn't important democratic not one because aoc sure go fellow democrats quite bit even time defended warren 
think that's end day democrat she might disagree centrist center left dems identify democratic socialist aoc actual member party 
wish bernie surrogates good aoc one biggest issues real grifters would cut loose 
same feel like aoc holy grail president line or even amazing treasure congress 
aoc shot arm sanders needed reinvigorate campaign she's great organizer 
the thing rubin long term experience democratic voters priorities she tears progressive wing building moderates wants vote democrat comfortable period that's true never trumpers 
thank you this wondered exact thing 
as mediocre white person also would like cushy job 
these news organizations want token conservative 
yet another never trump republican trying reshape party instead reflecting became abhorrent first place 
rubin anti trump that's good the minute democratic president sworn she'll go back liberal bashing nature touch gop politician smart enough realize hating right gives wapo column eyeballs 
because republicans left completely lost faculties publications desperate display diversity voices disingenuous hacks like rubin get kept payroll her hot take buttigieg clear winner last night spoiler that's entire time praised multiple times honestly supporter one main concerns would wondering repeatedly push best candidate shot warren's justified people pathetic openly sexist 
she peddling crap ages only worth ignoring occasionally dunking 
told people trust praising warren she's slimiest snakes 
love really hope runs presidency years president warren course 
the progressive wing supporters champions progressives show fire fight warren last night something done long time degree since occupy imo this bernie drawn passion makes believe means says 
st woman potus long overdue first would something history books 
mean i'd say rest candidates excluding bloomberg represent democratic party various ways they may future think belong hope lose 
warren straight beast last night more pls that start glorious 
she ability go number directions moving forwards could likely stay representative quite time chose sights set higher saw running president someday position senate would generally considered step upwards career wise however need wait one two current new york democratic senator retire primary take seat the latter probably controversial get kicking long incumbent democrat knows 
removed please use phrase refer bernie supporters it unnecessarily divisive feel free edit comment reply reapprove thanks 
fuck i've bernie bandwagon since love aoc what supporter like thought two things went together chocolate peanut butter she's endorsed fucks sake 
bernie bro commend warren last night's debate performance also appreciate way aoc speaks easily one favorite politicians grassroots campaign work committees sits she incredible think narrative control might speak opinion different rude i'll show there loud minority people get angry lot individuals misrepresenting senator sanders stands reasons issue it's going happen diverse coalition 
agree point anger weaponizable intrinsically positive politicians regularly exude avoid accused complacent whatever would tweet aoc say allowed angry must think important distinction everyone keep mind 
think part comes different ways men women's anger treated society men encouraged angry aggressive time punished showing feelings whereas women even slightest bit neither extremes healthy all humans regardless gender allowed feel express destructive fanatical degree 
get impression aoc's tweet like she saying genuine anger real impactful issues understandable reaction it response reductive insulting comment rubin dismissing speak softly carry big stick commanding people angry agree ott performative often unhelpful counterproductive but believe aoc really promoting concept 
really hope bernie reads comments his angry rehtoric concerning divisive 
this republican talking point she's highlighting difference funding plans please try disinformation bs 
sanders voter you win if warren wins nomination voting trump anyone else save bloomberg brainer 
think need win sanders voters i'm warren bunch equally unexciting better trump people and gap others huge 
hell warrens side surges polls seems likely win the whole reason sanders supporter mostly due polling present want risk centrist nominee let see happens next couple races 
sigh i'm longing ranked choice voting while warren get feeling lot people's again part push unity staying progressive course 
either fine they seem like intelligent people want make life better regular 
don worry sanders voter vote warren without hesitation gets nom 
sanders supporter come peace why think warren get nomination 
as many already said need win sanders voters let forget something like voted hillary warren even easier sell us 
warren last night pro superdelegates convention polarized bernie supporters know even favors making statements constantly defending allying klobuchar sanders the perpetual dig voters also questionable 'unity' approach given going need win nomination 
most sanders voters would gladly vote warren leading delegates it's basically every candidate lot say bust 
once warren gets nomination fantastic advocate comes time win sanders voters voter held nose voted hillary listened moderate people like guys best country even clinton cronies stole primary popular candidate chance defeat trump i'm voting democrat vote another life steal alone if want lose either get behind right guy fight battle 
because aoc sure go fellow democrats quite bit as says tweet anger injustice appropriate she's never gone based personality looks race gender etc she called policy 
exactly i've seen bernie people wonder lot mainstream dems like aoc large part appeal proud democrat working improve party 
his press secretary compared asking health records birtherism campaign full people like 
same one big reasons prefer warren high quality surrogates shows good judgment think would build amazing cabinet 
can't wait canvas presidential nominee alexandria ocasio cortez she's like sanders warren fusion dance dragon ball 
genuinely feel good idea time soon love aoc but think valuable gop boogieman congress maybe senate road stay house she ton power right she's shifting hell overton window i'd rather ted kennedy barack obama 
this absolutely true admit gutted first announced joining bernie's team reason haha wanted warren either way fighter progressive values blessed 
aoc deserves credit keeping bernie's campaign afloat heart attack huge endorsement exactly right time 
think he's great communicator person lifetime really substantially move overton window leftward he'd awful president he's perfect outside agitator power right direction center could get 
this always annoyance mine never trumpers they like say democratic party needs move center beat trump thinking want vote the problem enough make difference most conservatives regardless democrat wins nomination seem think massive army looking moderate see 
think literally anybody trump would still people like rubin side 
because moderate democrat worked well 
yeah you helped fuck republican party maybe best person come solution democratic 
my personal dream years warren castro aoc it pipe sticking 
yea would awesome honesty want years sander warren aoc continue new new deal remember term limit put place fdr enormously popular deal yea war time pres great plus especially ng nazis 
that fair think pete klobuchar biden kind side old democratic party stale ideas mindset incremental growth we simply time try play nice republicans they care working class values families good conscience vote candidate platform includes let reach across aisle platitudes no it straight victimize donors if planet going saved future generations eat rich make sure everyone america regardless mitigating factors gets living wage healthcare freedom crippling student loan debt access educational opportunities unprecedented scale 
okay edited will watch next time 
eh saw political discussion thread upvoted comments bernie supporters suggesting picks wrong vp vote general stuff like narrative legs saying think way 
congresswoman katie porter is national hero gets cdc commit free coronavirus testing 
from i've heard seen katie porter seems like warren democrat right 
katie porter took elizabeth warren class harvard also became research assistant co wrote one textbooks law professor asked running office progressives flip seat red blue named daughter 
that beautiful line questioning it also makes thankful modern medical school curricula touch pocket expenses common labs procedures better handle cost effective medicine heaven forbid go single payer 
she's great receive mail polls showing reelection jeopardy now msnbc reporting trump wants revenge he flew california last month raise millions defeat house democrats for inclined here's triple match donation link email https secure actblue com donate ms ecu fr porter surrogate akid pc amount amounts rd recurring auto refcode ms em fr endcitizensunited porter ac rs 
rep kicking ass since took office proud especially considering orange county notoriously republican 
that's good news congresswoman katie porter deserves everyone's gratitude but can't help thinking trump et al renege promise 
good persisting shame takes efforts smallest sensible concessions 
yay katie porter the cdc never keep end deal unfortunately little faith government right 
this kind leadership get behind 
she really if warren decides run president old much hope katie porter pick reigns continue charge i'm sure nothing would make elizabeth proud 
katie porter one favorite people congress right 
just cause said camera mean trump let happen 
please donate campaign continue good work american people https secure actblue com pccc bp porter 
are sure commitment real love worry potentially another layer false information 
i'm glad volunteered campaign last cycle 
sounds like proves need healthcare 
she warren former student explicitly endorsed president 
she's one three co chairs https twitter com ewarren status warren's campaign that's warren democrat come 
porter even named daughter warren she's wonderful teacher mentor mean elizabeth we're close https www nbcnews com think opinion holding washington accountable rep katie porter podcast transcript ncna 
smart effective probably warren democrat 
she's one maybe people flip republican seat running progressive agenda 
yes surrogate warren campaign she also took one warren's classes harvard think 
she student liz harvard yeah 
she campaign co chair she's pretty amazing live ca really hope runs senate feinstein retires years 
so great as woman demonstrating leadership elected probably described shrill alarmist fox right 
she also surrogate warren's campaign warren democrats get sh done 
god damn hopefully time come progressive people particularly women like aoc porter make waves finally get country decent place woman president either way warren clearly made impacts younger generations very proud caucused 
current medical student going say priority healthcare disparities pocket expenses systematic problems system certainly emphasized curriculum taken lightly majority class supports mfa though liberal diverse city like think generation physicians different perspective issues med school knowing dollars loan debt turn attracting slightly pool applicants guess time tell really hope right 
from heard government official walked back promise shortly afterwards 
that direct link goes half something called end citizens united the split changed though give edit donated thanked monthly recurring donation gave ten seconds change one time that's shady hell 
i'm nearby district hi neighbor i've extremely impressed also pleasantly surprised much seems like figured she'd deep trouble reelection given history makeup current primary results 
from heard government official walked back promise shortly afterwards 
why stop one warren democrat hell let get ticket ayanna pressley katie porter care top can think anything better 
removed rule unless proof hospitals able perform tests case provide statements ability respond public health crisis 
makes sad warren nominee she best candidate miles not electability smarts policies 
and named daughter professor mentor elizabeth warren 
she supported hillary clinton warren primary unclear supports 
this actually happened orange county rep neighbor district two away ran similarly progressive platform historically red 
yes said elizabeth warren terrifying https www youtube com watch ap pewwdxpe professor 
love porters and stouts the memes write 
wonder emoji misogynists choose year 
sorry yeah careful donation links successful changing monthly donations single days afterwards though 
hi neighbor yes think beyond work people love regular town halls us the last one tried go filled really quickly 
removed rule please use retarded insult also please make personal attacks 
serious they're much better policy work floor campaigning different things great campaigners obviously rewarded one many faults system george bush example brilliant campaigner played faux cluelessness appeal american majority remembered fairly poor president sides twice deserves credit running campaign well warren marketed planner appeals pragmatic americans option though good got senate first place elected history involves epiphany led switch whereas prefer someone held opinions entire lives made pretty questionable moves throughout think even biased supporters would say discussions medicare quarrel bernie select interviews etc questions track record really little effective policies either 
no harm done just hoping help others pay closer attention went process 
i'm fan sanders and biden definitely number one choice much better chance winning presidency bernie can't even win washington 
well based current results makes think get years trump bernie elected nom 
we choose nominee less support really the candidate mountain baggage trump gop openly rooting propped russia second election row year old man refused drop heart attack and reneged promise release full medical records you've got completely delusional believe sanders electable biden considering latter driving high turnout former can't even get base show 
disagree her policies left facing average voter evidenced exit the chief executive planner needs leader inspire others action 
warren win home state tho 
you phrase like washington presidency different stages contest they're 
polling suggests bernie would beat trump head matchup 
never said warren electable shes smart would make great president 
he's losing swing states how's going win presidency cant beat biden michigan 
general election polling far worthless almost correlation reality 
mean polling said hillary would beat trump yet 
you ignoring polling also bernie ahead biden there certainty head polls trump turn like 
so biden winning exactly does make sense coalesce around guy majority democratic party support 
the main reason people cited voting biden sanders electability if magically primary argument would invalid matter general 
what as warren supporter no idea true 
elizabeth warren it shame mike bloomberg buy way debate but least primary voters curious candidate take donald trump get live demonstration egomaniac billionaire 
lmao tomorrow better absolute roast 
ask feels pregnant women work blacks latinos what nationality prone criminal lol he done pm 
oh boy better get popcorn tomorrow 
warren needs singular surgical memorable strike bloomberg early debate after focus message best person job leave subsequent mudslinging amy campaign built hot takes right and bernie campaigning specifically billionaires like trump need heavy hitter she position trustworthy heal divided party lead fractured country away brink that's unique strength lean get across we likely going brokered convention if comes supporters swing hard without compromise the moderate establishment someone pete think actually ends agreeing vitriol professional presidential 
think bloomberg ready sanders primarily it'd political malpractice know he's going literally face circular firing squad assume prepared may much pol paid best managers buy because i'm curious warren handle progressive flank want continue showing acerbic wit continuing edge however unity message might resonate lot one fighting the problem airtime get she destroyed pete last debate word words far can't called but knows could change trajectory entire campaign moving super tuesday excited see gameplan fucking body 
bloomberg going bernie warren question go offensive dig pete stay message also think moderates either way messy 
bernie supporter absolutely love let's keep good fight real enemies trump bloomberg billionaire cabal 
wait watch liz knock quite pegs 
think lot people tune see bloomberg debate imperative warren amazing night tomorrow love come perfect mixture staying brand core message showing take giant ego billionaires donald trump outright saying subtly implying the unity candidate connect bridge center left party 
as messed change rules debates bloomberg could participate think warren going make regret getting stage first place too many people know ads history right it might much ask really want another memeable moment like delaney plus candidates go hard bernie almost definitely throat biden klobuchar pete able simultaneously bloomberg's demonstrating difference moderate dems held office republican independent democrat friendly policies honestly can't imagine main target everyone 
stuff like love warren really hope make debate only answer questions falsehoods otherwise ignore non contender 
this real thriller warren best foil bloomberg well perfect one 
given people stage debates past months means bloomberg underdog hope falls hard otherwise media give benefit doubt i'm mostly curious attack progressives moderates try stay focused trump defending policies rather attacking others interesting debate 
she needs make point one stage unafraid lock them up even bernie commit investigations prosecutions trump administration agents donors co conspirators 
know biden pete amy moderates bernie warren teams love hate other's ideologies sometimes especially reddit but god hope candidates team slaughter reputation billionaires exist it's ridiculous and president 
https media tenor com images eb ef gif itemid 
she needs careful though not prepared remember nyc mayoral campaigns he uninspiring public speaker vicious debater absolutely qualms punching low try avoid counterpunch methodical shredding might better approach amy takedown style also really believe draw contrast bernie fast point plan garbage point platform fantasy intend nuking filibuster packing courts got real progressive stuff done fierce opposition literally anything 
hoping simple couple minutes steyer make lay bit bloomberg not whole debate know in general like respect stage even myriad issues earned and yes clear wins nom vote 
want go bernie least little going drop st polling indicates looks likely bloomberg surged literally everywhere even freaking massachusetts guess heroic team player always trying crater motherfucker 
feeling tomorrow debate consist mostly candidates ganging bloomberg him race favorable absolutely one 
bernie supporter amazing can't wait see two progressives tag teaming dunks bloomberg lmao 
warren stay focus message if anyone want fight target trump this really unite democrats think anti corruption good all tied winning research found https www vox com ian haney lopez merge left race class project trump racism dog whistles no matter come color us work hard families today certain politicians greedy lobbyists hurt everyone handing kickbacks rich defunding schools threatening seniors cutting medicare social security then turn around point finger times poor black people new immigrants we need join together walks life future like better wages safer workspaces civil rights past by joining elect leaders wealthy attacks implicitly candidates already helping voters rather criticizing style attack also seems women amy klobuchar demonstrated hillary clinton bernie sanders endorse amy klobuchar and tell complete lack empathy guy white house right bring trouble stretching paycheck pay rent know deciding going child care long term figuring fill refrigerator prescription drug male previously likely dinged palmieri wrote politico magazine story sexism jennifer palmieri politico qualities celebrated liabilities stories intimidating bosses typically presented disqualifying evidence men formidable these underestimated respected 
it feel like bought way election feels trying buy this said running what made change mind he mayor years lot people stop frisk one reasons and showing trust throwing money around get late https www theguardian com us news feb michael bloomberg past controversial remarks gq story sexism 
one think good get stage reason everyone else grilling months free ride 
we need candidates call hypocracy dnc allowing bloomberg debate castro booker gravel first billionaire able buy way see bernie elizabeth taking gloves going 
hey bernie supporter got caught stupid internet politics started dislike warren whole sexist debacle this tweet reminded much common kick ass next debate love 
mods remove post splitting democrats 
it roast debate moderators let if give mike speaking time someone needs utterly emasculate bloomberg stage though tons supporters think he's tough guy trump can't bully they've internalized bunch fox news bullshit democrats sissies warren sanders given tearing i'm really hoping klobuchar palpable disdain everyone around bring aerodynamic throwing binders party 
the roast mike bloomberg hosted elizabeth warren wait 
expecting roasts bloomberg bernie honestly lot push back week this messiest debate yet 
they want stage everyone currently gets obama endorsed commercials really wish would speak

can hardly wait long knives come thank mike giving everybody debate stage common enemy 
man warren ever deliver goods god tier debate domination 
warren's best lane attack bloomberg pretends numbers guy stop frisk racist fascism never added it reasonable suspicion 
the best part candidates essentially promised telegraphed go bloomberg debate warren https twitter com ewarren status it shame mike buy way but least primary voters curious candidate take donald trump get live demonstration egomaniac billionaire klobuchar cnnsotu think able hide behind airwaves huge ad buys know going beat stage sanders berniesanders mr like anybody else right run president he presidency buttigieg nbcnewspr answer treatment others language attitude seems dismissed humanity lot people biden's campaign adviser symone meetthepress in opinion unvetted and spent bulk week weathering headlines everything expansion stop frisk sexual harassment company today said transgender america honestly looking forward weird unity moment every single tells bloomy gtfo 
she needs hammer best anti corruption plan first priority unity candidate positioning come later viciously attack others get back fighting mode have focus position without returning power people nothing else said stage matter then use actual achievement consumers finance protection bureau actually recovered money citizens previous positions prosecuting jailing bankers 
needs soundbites unfortunate true aspect modern media she lost much college educated base nh amy could team pete attack fumble regarding president mexico progressive vote continue say represents everyone defend bernie inevitable attacks bloomberg maybe attacking may opportune also risk an effective cripple sanders chances flub would kill chance progressives considering primary make inroads working class minority voters particularly next two contests highlight plans future work better trump plan overall take page book do stage unless instigated shame anyone lean experience significant legislative comparison else minus biden that one possible implicit jab mention third delegate count appear front runner serve tie breaker many 
liz bernie tag team lfg 
literally ask fund raised republican instead democrat ma senate election anyone take seriously he'd rather see office then pull harris say that democratic candidate and way 
honestly i'm surprised even going debate seems well throwing money tv ads 
if ignore continue contender everyone else stage needs rip mask scooby doo style let everyone see fascist 
understand thread people saying warren unity candidate comments sanders plan garbage like lol cmon even expect bernie supporters play nice say things like 
yeah bernie sexist really made dislike warren thanks stopping 
removed rule suggest review rules prior participating sub 
expect klobuchar lash fiercely her campaign already saw major results nh attacked pete it actually pretty telling centrist candidates go easy though 
it roast debate moderators let if give mike speaking time every response addressed allotted rebuttal which attack brief point hopefully pretty much singular he's also front runner she needs get her points 
hope bloomberg gets full michael bennet treatment 
so person let temper expectations bit while think liz democrats land good points bloomberg would also suspect quite things punch back after million dollars get long way probably pretty decent debate prep team need take everyone seriously matter much disagree campaign people underestimating bad idea 
yes especially since obama endorsement blatant lie bloomberg endorsed week election statement read like endorsing romney 
amy said interview hopes makes bloomberg taking voters others moderate lane pete biden according polling 
could see bernie leaving work warren sit vague comments supporters continue lie plan call snake like took heat months back lash everyone policy strong fair ways she's gentle accused harsh 
agree bernie coasting debates nobody taking compare liz frontrunner spent two hours knock back people 
kind hoping outcome i'm honest 
that happen sadly bernie lesser two evils 
yep lol warren giving inch 
hey this hurts soul remove rule four please refrain calling far right republican link proposals disagree criticize using facts 
think move imo steal thunder moderate wing wants exactly bloomberg without plutocrat show academic working class background disgustingly corrupt fight back people instead pushing status quo unity come later agree corruption needs rooted party tolerates ought represent democratic coalition win trump 
yes good point hammer anti corruption home stick message stick plans she pitch best candidate president based plans accomplishments cannot market 'unity' mean anything relative property division brokered convention may fall 
think similar dynamic july debate anything like sign 
the he's much coward debate narrative would deadly whiffing 
attack time gets others mention gives this trump bloomberg could create scourched earth criticisms candidates lessened sheer amount juggled around willing bet game plan since ads far mainly attacks candidates bernie strategy also may work fact loud spoken camp actively criticizing valid promoting platform boy cried wolf scenario new attempts call candidate progressive enough republican land mostly deaf ears worry ability buy everyone he greatly impact super tuesday way stop would personal ad buys think stopping calling billionaire republican racist simple label likely despite evidence things the best debate handle probably amplify positive messages maybe give free advertising thrown directly do speaking necessary sound bite invalidate statement makes 
unity mean vetting candidates pointing flaws criticized plan person playing far nicer sanders people swarming twitter snakes 
think amy's going concentrate pete she needs sink super tuesday thinks real shot wrong plus seems genuinely loathe man 
my predictions obviously centrist candidates use bloomberg opportunity attack cultural left but importantly amy pete try history economic policies since gives rare portray aligning populism even though these attacks fall flat wont media pick soundbites amplify degree biden's weakest he's never able launch successful candidate similar terms message policy warren also angles focus political unaccountability billionaire if ask like redlining austerity etc this best way draw direct comparison strength protector working people everybody aunt talking stop frisk need cover for designated winner debate needs vocal important distinction sanders course bring attention bloomberg's status oligarch republican par really give much think respond pay lip service changed show they're divisive he'll repeat stump speech mike land audience we've hearing variations biden buttigieg months unneeded exposure one campaign next day cycle shows clips 
easily see biden attacking trying buy way election well use obama's legacy get foot door it's depressingly hilarious imagine dripping irony situation indignantly bloomberg falsely claiming support essence biden's entire run especially obama even endorsed 
mil team talented smart people actually believed help magically make biden debate performances good if got and campaign trail anything go bloomer 
the couple debates watched moderators asking warren questions bernie wanted asked jumped opportunity watch thd nh debate work heard media said restrained npr maybe ones honestly seeing supporters attack constantly incredibly dumb 
know would hope outcome unless sanders supporter 
mean agree want warren win get people switch bernie know never place face substantive criticism trustworthy presidential contender debate 
guess murdering everyone stage one path nomination 
uh mean far right republican attack insult label based recent history support far politicians also even say he said economic politics aligned if bernie democrat he's independent think would removed 
she needs get back have plan for that insanely good message and disappeared even recent ad featuring anti corruption bill back plans policy fighting 
position really hope liz better happily pull lever bernie wyoming looks pragmatic 
last time checked garbage actual critique secondly emojis bother dare say life pretty good 
not warren probably get removed wanna say supporters duty call lies surrounding bernie health see

i've seen posts attacking bernie's health scare sort ploy get media attention sympathy hashtag warren they're tone deaf can't help feeling among people trying sow bad blood sanders campaigns 
as bernie supporter really appreciate sub making bernie's ailments political pawn move shows still humility climate hopefully urge collaboration two front running progressives 
it become standard politics celebrate illness fellow americans while bernie may gone way disagree still spent entire life service this country in day age taken granted elected officials sanders deserves love long surrounded grateful citizens 
this nice guys appreciate bernie supporter first really like treat warren next hillary but tbf also fair criticisms they exaggerate the people post fake news marxists communists knight shining armour and honestly even angel would find something smear it disgusting affiliated campaign represent supporters most low income working class want fight economic social change good yes going get bad eggs hardcore following easily bigger donald trump fastest candidate million individual donors beat record months so naturally carried away 
bernie supporter thanks this politics conducted not post truth sensationalism thats prevalent today warren probably second choice btw

bernie supporter pretty far now like said want things right no one warren candidate gonna get sympathy saying hurtful bernie health lot grievances around policies well hope back campaign chooses soon possible above human probably scared scare routine procedure person concerned recover physically mentally 
we know routine procedure bernie heart attack 
this sub awesome extremely positive specifically tries stop negative misinformation with said i'd consider glossing news heart attack year old 'routine' serious it's biden's eye hillary's dizzy spell statistically significantly decreased bernie's life expectancy that's simply fact the median survival time person years https www cardiovascularbusiness com topics acute coronary syndrome study older mi patients die within fair single handedly brought progressive movement back spotlight cards he's dealt wish best luck hope continues push 
except routine means coronary heart disease chronic simply cured it best one step short attack caught early at worst actual described artery blockage euphemism absolutely does call question viability not already really drive point home man pushing probably running president goes biden he should drop will continue harm health shorten lifespan race become increasingly clear cannot win wish frankly retire relax enjoy remaining years family likely die earlier necessary tries keep pace going that joke exaggeration sugarcoating things well meaning attempt nice productive the literally continues campaign vigorously oughta take wake suspected something wrong wise last debate actually exceeded fears could needs stop sake 
absolutely agree the progressive movement stands today owes existence bernie sanders performance last primary he's someone want need around wish speedy recovery best campaign trail remember healthy debate good cause 
think sanders back predict weeks trail and debates th 
agreed bernie supporters allies bernie's procedure super serious course media whoever else thinks they'll benefit make big deal happened

think warren sanders lot overlap honestly really like would pleased either ended ticket flip flop two quite bit they awesome 
really hope bernie sanders fine think people making electoral math benefits drops race disgusting that said fair worried good faith health heart operation serious problem matter put if capable continuing campaign without pushing that's great can't not saying political thing personal 
bernie wonderful person wish absolute best quickest recovery 
all warren supporters need watch video https youtu kzcq brum 
i'm nurse who's worked healthcare years it exactly routine procedure caught quickly myocardial damage ischemia good bernie may likely coronary artery disease hypertension blood thinners rest life puts risk gastrointestinal hemorrhage runs another heart attack stroke especially stress imagine actually campaigning trump would really bad senator sanders anecdotal neighbor quite vigorous active suffered three infarctions gotten stents time it's light thing happen common maybe unfortunately still serious 
as bernie yang supporter currently i'm sad say two posts removed mods asking legitimate questions trying clarify liz's positions kind surprising based awesome community appears sometimes trolling if anyone cares chat let know i'd really appreciate 
totally disagree post bernie health issues put hospital he already past median lifespan american men these disqualifying facts ahead run important job world 
while absolutely love bernie voted think changes much viability draw attention one major problems candidate feel lot safer warren hold office years progressives actually lying health 
bernie dropping you know he made announcement either way cancelled campaign events indefinitely that's fact relatively routine procedure open heart surgery never it may exotic certainly indicative disease doctors say fine none calls question viability interesting put two statements together recovering well think likely discharge paperwork says take easy avoid stress need see source if mean indicate doctors assessment careful sentence structure also quote want defend lies yet produce lie yes lot speculation just people saying things hear make we bernie's plans point probably mind stop huge ad buy iowa why would there questions answered pretending like answers every bit much propaganda pretending he's death bed 
hope warren selects bernie vp 
even competitors moment bernie crucial progressive left democrats specifically warren's overall chance success get nomination for time matchup grand scheme absolutely together 
agreed really doubt us making big deal subs but let slide either imho 
even warren wished well hoped see back campaign trail soon while bernie supporter issue casting vote wins primary 
subscribe lot candidate subs get good overall idea viewpoints y'all super wholesome 
support progressives it difficult felt good see warren supporters intellectual consistency bernie even always shown lately 
well know sub bernie supporter feels like they're similar enough warren sanders supporters would still perfectly pleased matter one want best chance winning 
mean lot us probably supported sanders warren similar positions explain better younger 
even beyond long game conspiracy theories rumours hurting democrats large matter nominee decent thing even small adherence huge impact great respect sen sanders admittedly miffed extreme online following understanding twitter real life during she people forum lot mayor pete skipping avoid discuss race fact missing father's memorial service one bernie stan accounts responding bunch basically saying this appropriate campaign represented there's time discussing differences candidates making case the man lost father family needs 
thanks allowing hope bernie continue fight us 
know anyone claimed coming think really thinks maybe tiny bit inevitably mostly positivity 
also berner second chumstick's sentiment 
we'll need come together end one way another even third ugh reference intentional stop evil clown repair nightmare world he's created the lose beat plan contributing 
thank speaking behalf ew realize lot anti warren hate bernie subs trolls try influence real people call prevent better 
i've learned lot stents past days lots people saying felt like teenager procedure 
so saying call lies one lie everything fine there's nothing see that true this serious problem drs caught time probably would heart attack exactly our duty factual grounded reality when news obviously false going far direction well good sanders campaign we gloat highly inappropriate nevertheless acknowledge simple fact 
you right people go chest pains event rushed hospital immediate emergency heart surgery routine basis that means either attack brink one probably die get operation lark this serious business handwaved away 
know everything fine doctors say well exact medical condition speculate informational vacuum 
honestly anyone blockage dislodged stent placed going told doctors avoid long flights getting frequently flight that one first thoughts worrying campaign put direct risk i'm hoping continues well definitely concern while actual procedure simple recovery underlying issue caused need still 
folks definitely underplaying frankly health political impact while true he'll probably fine short recovery rightfully imo reignite age debate best predictor future heart problems past there's absolutely way near year old man emergent cardiac catheterization campaign trail going nominee say respect sanders hope retains place senate long time but already polling distant third rate chance winning less tulsi 
bernie mission he still going cares it shows everything he's even willing sacrifice well keep fighting 
i'm doctor i've read doctors entirely possible heart attack 
don speculate abide others speculating you go bat call lie no one knows right claim know to campaign even turned true moment participate sort attack 
agree points there's every reason correct misinformation it's like emergency open heart surgery portraying unfair however also think sanders campaign downplaying the fact stent implanted short notice either suggests attack unstable angina article https slate com technology bernie sanders diagnosis stents chest pain html slate explains well even scant information abcnews go politics canceled events hospitalized story id inserted overnight following acute cardiac episode enough able say this likely alternative while patients receive often feel better afterward attacks prevented small number risks procedure www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed considered dangerous including bleeding possibility inducing severe symptoms undergo catheterization moreover tests could performed determined reporting results latter seems wall street journal ran wsj articles cancels due health issues originally stated spokesperson said senator suffer later updated remove assertion states would run determine continues discuss take hours days suggesting know yet seem realistic 
it one common issues procedures fine so let turn talking point you want done warren sudden issue happen anyone really alarming anything else anyone could medical moment factor decision unless like terminal 
seen subs like politics idk supporters twitter sorts people including ew best tell genuine accounts trolls so little column 
that new information it still routine procedure meaning quite common high rate survival my grandfather lived years heart attack edit bbc article event receiving stents minimally invasive typically short recovery time us national heart lung blood institute says don use someone medical situation point bad faith know live die if something voters personally concerned fine but participating rumors extremely rude gossip health whether think keep morbid thoughts 
nah think genuinely concerned big boy make decisions like healthy enough run happy retiring anyhow 
the progressive movement stands today owes existence bernie sanders performance last primary no just like voted donated campaign hours news stent procedure by means please support candidates across board election but buy cult personality anyone else undoubtedly prominent figure american left aoc elizabeth warren many others democratic party we also decades far various socialist parties green attributing everything disingenuous dangerous imo whether wins loses need voters voices engaged want see excuses disengagement move forward whatever reason that big part ended trump first place 
know saw running total bernie raised like candidate overall love self identify bro rather getting uptight haha 
it's warren clearly want win attacking someone's health can't possibly know live die rude shitty tactic there's plenty reasons find superior candidate debate those low blow stuff like holding involuntary heart attack 
post knew heart attack grandfather lived years my died earlier you cannot know someone die pretending individual basis promote candidate shitty 
warrenplanbot right able ask questions positions various things typing name topic 
that fine bernie great guy wish well we all upset cautious fanning flames division especially since always know starting 
you go fight as example illustrates though lose if rather call smears sake that's fine think democrats look back pain frustration including primary ok still feel but there's quell disinformation remain civil also say us you've rightly called people behaved badly for future party country let's focus better 
think fight fire frustrated bad attacks well mean back it drive people alway anyways drove away bernie camp wanna recreate 
stop trying relitigate warren surrogate hillary probably lot happier life 
this comment removed violating rule dividing democrats 
it open heart surgery couple stents one instantly felt better the staff order stay bed good 
yeah defend bernie just rely facts 
this bullshit pretending medical answers the lies defending cancelling campaign we assume says it lie say announced seen indication as you know dumbest argument ever also warren prove negative but safely unless hear otherwise serious open heart surgery sensationalism happening around procedure hand quick minimally invasive bernie records ok huge deal made fine okay again reason believe doctors complete he recovering complications besides maybe wanted 
okay can't say anything negative sanders even wonder health scare fuck biden okay hypocrisy 
biden sucks also vote nominee 
while would nice also lose seats senate 
honestly imagine either would well without the message get drowned 
the intention disparage pete instead talk way media people online warren

we need stress background one demonstrates american dream many unattainable 
warren embodiment american dream this polls well highly educated financially successful demographics people also made still alive 
more accurate comparison joe biden vs warren coverage he's seen people he's worked politics white collar life 
it's warren booker rhodes scholar one talks whereas first thing that's mentioned article buttigieg let enjoy media honeymoon the inevitable breakup divorce ugly 
even better let's stop obsessing biographical details candidates whether they're elites native american judge policy commitments theories political change 
see point buttigieg represents midwestern city warren state new england candidacy also much appealing moderates sorts people live indiana think background really least far back kind image politician cultivates tailor message talking someone conservative comes fairly religious she likes pete feels like talks family way seems get avoid coming across condescending know still disagreeing that whole schtick developed liberal gay guy trying place thing passionate proponent policy proposals pretty different folksy attitude say better worse styles politicians focused constituencies 
as pete supporter first approve message 
know buttigieg definitely marketed midwesterner whereas warren much knowledge see area candidate reason vote long decent person it crazy litmus test people trying say one better based geography childhood at point anything breathing current top picks even though vastly different candidates feel like strengths 
got different perspective beto supporter welcome life we need stay positive pushed back hard the media really started anointing pete pound narrative ground just look joe mika fawning 
literally supporter donated both get pretty bad takes especially bernie supporters we fantastic either warren pete white house 
unrelated substance either candidates policies women plural woman singular if talking oklahoma went public school single moms liz warren show 
pete called mid westerner simply currently lives midwest warren lived decades 
when women become singular noun see lot online what plural 
also pete worth around warren 
of course gets midwest cred on basic level suspect voters still may stay liz known east coast senator talks policies money lot something cfpb thing pete mayor smallish town indiana doesn't get much midwestern warren's ties mostly past pete's literally baked title i'm convinced really media bias oversimplification another note attack upper middle class academic makes college professor sound menacing warren let's pretend strike father job wish sub would focus policy excels petty attacks candidates people undecided help disparage 
ehhh running campaign boston lot harvard types he's staying indiana get point candidate slag pete perception 
how could claim meant disparage pete 
think warren incredible academic admire much legislator that said rip candidates apart handing republicans talking points quick route losing election stay positive almost would really fine leaders 
and let's forget pete dines real elites warren answering questions shaking hands biden takes money getting 'the working class moderate bernie progressive he also gets economic policy candidate despite fact ba poli sci lifelong political career tenured professor teaching researching law economics years ever entering politics it's hard tell lobby country hates women truth better everything people like candidates 
think ok really counts midwest like texas minor 
i'll happy disparage buttigieg not upbringing face medicare all soon checks big pharma insurance cashed he's corrupt made man bought paid why would anyone vote knowing 
go incredible lengths argue woman 
what point pete gets exact accusations elite uppity gay man how convenient user completely erase incredibleness personal attacks disgusting beneath democrats 
females always work harder respect men 
https www theguardian com commentisfree nov elizabeth warren progressive 
ugh going win anyone grievances 
most pete popularity thanks fact able convince people small town everyday american formerly unknown mayor midwestern city open christianity everyday americans go harvard 
mean fair pete currently midwest elizabeth warren 
dont think pete son academic considering warren former professor 
watched media clip someone saying better prepare attacks buttigieg turn right back first warren characteristic way one still answered actions south bend secondly along lines quote makes sound like possible valid criticisms made clearly 
not warren's tale heroic enough really single mom according wikipedia entry graduated law school divorced 
wow all janitors assumed dirt poor children cripplingly disadvantaged bit leap 
people call elite leans background everytime stump feel like media coverage accurate see she signals hard fought 
the whole point country supposed work hard become successful 'elitist' 
exactly liz warren embodies things country rewarding 
she's also years accomplish things if year old liz running president would laugh experience 
you know i'm much team warren realized chaired tarp oversight committee cool 
i'm rabid warren supporter that said let's walk back wealthy donor statement an inevitability campaigning nationally meeting donors campaign her personally maybe much but directs sure communicates there's nothing wrong it takes billion dollars win office we real 
some people resent financial success left nothing attitude sustainable appeal general election voters 
think definitely works explained background mom still undecided said considering voting warren thinks amazing professor teacher 
one person talked really opened elizabeth warren mentioned she'd dropped college one point got married perfect robot she's human figured way growing like us 
that basically premise fighting chance 
american dream died nixon hunter thompson describes and george carlin quips reason called the believe asleep whole point warren's ascendancy make new hollow like old one 
it available either large swathes population 
yeah least biden resume deserve stage 
yep in mentions pete's rhodes scholarship compared booker https www huffpost com entry buttigieg booker rhodes scholar dcf ebe cb 
yes it's also funny hear buttigieg fans say executive experience important booker amount mayor went gained senator dark view inexperience actually positive claim whatever want touch charisma people look positively potential the debate hosts grilling candidates way really makes like yang steyer sweat effect holding experienced records guess left league women voters kicked hosting 
when dive mayor pete's resume outside military experience find get better lot candidates including warren you think great pete went harvard it impressive taught being executive senator okay booker castro de blassio bernie bloomberg mayors newark san antonio new york much harder manage south bend in fact actually worked us branch so biden politically conscious obama administration end bringing serves show might ready thinly veiled justification little support 
thought true first wave saw was proud quickly got happened 
get point media thing trump got loads eyeballs watching stump speeches free 
because pete relatively new national politics still introducing hence gets introduced rhodes scholar booker around years us senator this ridiculous point 
it truly representative legacy white patriarchal supremacy buttigieg taken seriously boosted media least qualified person running he absolutely must close friends high nbc cnn ect makes zero sense given much attention begin maybe possible certain threads party leadership wanted nock progressives peg way find candidate completely blank slate either honestly disgusting watch many incredibly candidates pushed aside boost pete's time 
see point buttigieg represents midwestern city warren state new england this bit tangent englander pisses matter never considered real americans we great universities boston's well yes also rural areas hardscrabble postindustrial towns plenty working class people ivy tower elites media insists 
indiana moderate though it's far reddest state midwest count plains separate region since little common geographically economically culturally historically obama winning barely political upset par civil war terms unprecedented unlikely ever happen alaska south carolina partisan lean turn blue long due ongoing brain drain getting redder georgia texas arizona north turning swing states due influx former residents like means democrats already reagan electoral college blowout anyway pete almost certainly win iowa clinton might run popular vote score indianapolis suburbs without actually carrying candidates 
i'm hard time premise op's post though see points well the pete campaign signaling midwest thing sure consensus candidate they lot elite pedigree add credibility beginning part reason think besides racism booker associated rhodes scholar buttigieg signaled media to last point warren connects issue people pay attention directly coverage sexist tone iowans keyed politics rise relatability people's everyday needs 
the point warren needs midwestern label 
if google pete puff pieces even though frontrunner but liz almost negative edit let also focus white msm anointing polling zero black voters 
the media zuckerberg seems introduced pete people money valley private fundraisers 
came say please let back 
it warren called midwesterner gets folksy softballs media reamed elitist currently well lives east 
the warrens' couple worth your point 
elitism opposite populism it little net worth think country operate run wealthy academics run democratically warren elitist precisely grow wealth academia subgroups 
this attacking either attributes considered high brow there malice words upper middle class academic it pointing disingenuous approach msm adopted towards pete relative warren no one hates college professors candidate former love if people take attack ridiculous 
there upper middle class academics teach professional schools buttigieg parents professors english the pay shit barely source professor 
disparage it like read nobody said strike pete educated parents 
also oklahoma midwest state either recall liz's full bio grow represent one government side note part pete says well brain drain states coasts that problem people abandoning coast 
know many times gotta say neither tweet post slagging pete where see 
as explained title discussion media coverage 
because lmao this remotely insult pete candidacy way though disparity warren it points disingenuous portrayal two msm 
how could claim disparages pete 
i'm gonna agree media coverage i've seen much higlight he's salt earth blahblahblah actually think lean 
like read title even tweet nobody said anything negative pete 
okay think easy right come biden buttiegeg general anyway neither guys would way fine leader except happen trump 
agreed can't inspirational people engaging life stories 
show attack quote exact words think candidate 
don't know voted you're spot 
do stop mother get law degree her son first husband got divorced 
there singular media shares common opinion every single journalist editor this ridiculous oversimplification 
it seems warren supports forgot months glowing coverage come wake 
making leap oh right bye troll 
what trying show campaign deserving member elite without become elitist every candidate stage virtue deemed important enough considered nomination many millionaires many wrote best selling books live wealthy cities think voters hold voters elitism candidates however that's almost every emphasizes everyman everywoman appeal ie small town coming poor family etc it's want beer factor warren emphasizing upbringing young adult life hard work get demonstrates quality taking selfies person wants one shows cares things normal people care sadly likes instagram but highlighting law cfbp senate gives credibility stature presumes run country 
we win liz delivered fighting corruption 
what original picture also lol bloomberg 
guess take anything positive yesterday fucking bloomberg 
bloomberg eating expensive crow dinner history 
if nothing else warren single handedly saved us new normal billionaires routinely buy elections democracy grows ever people even end already america 
i'm thrilled idea biden winning nomination would absolutely devastated bloomberg really think started new era people literally buying way government fortunately looks like money world can't make complete lack political skill 
at least see annoying ads tv youtube mike bloomberg 
liz one best political athletes game she done public service dems progressives everywhere 
she one went hardest so much respect warren if would surged past biden terrifying reveal 
not trying brigade wanted say amazing destroying it public service true servant anyone on the epstein flight logs 
best part yesterday so disappointed better holding sliver hope if biden wins nom needs pick strong progressive vp given split party 
yeah fucking bodied it glorious 
she's one knows take people 
she went mistreatment women specifically corruption it's interesting attacks effective we're still unlikely elect woman president time soon 
believe got bloomberg drop america repays voting thanks proved tonight always want choice president old men 
and that's slay dragon elizabeth warren definition true grit 
hate bernie supporters social media blaming warren biden idiot bloomberg trying buy way election 
bloomberg dropping bad news liz now progressive vote split moderate united behind biden and like zero chance bernie drop this fucking sucks my heart hurting wanted president long 
honestly i'm super proud liz historic campaign fake corporate candidate using identity politics genuine real hard progressive still course hoping thinking going win long time blame advisors surrounded tried push direction comfortable look polls soon started listening advice dropped quick great lizzie sure president day 
i'm glad narrative really mike bloomberg he got exactly wanted paid warren gone we giggle money spent care hope cost reputation more americans know he's evil man but spend rest life surrounded fellow billionaires call hero 
itt bernie folks brigading toxic good outreach much praxis 
democrats got make minds want candidate bernie sanders joe biden once done work defeating real corrupt criminal trump 
it amazing take unfortunately think also caught negative effects well many people country like see woman embarrass man even agree assertive women cannot win old electorate 
see one mean chance biden winning that's warren bernie double teaming debates looks like joke people switch votes 
bleed bernie give liz major props taking mike far best thing could've happened country that piece shit nothing intelligent version donald trump never ever president 
bernie supporter naysayers question did watch debates she consistently put bloomberg hurt locker period end story 
hell yeah nevada debate thing broke campaign money wise obviously 
it first time called nevada instant point drop beautiful stuff wonder manage eat biden next debate 
bloomberg got exactly wanted contributing knocking two progressives race via super tuesday it nice see debate stage anymore going anywhere unfortunately he continue donating corrupt influence dnc 
it's laughed really loud love disappointed liz poorly primary least took bloomberg i'm fine biden even first choice know would've done became nominee 
elizabeth warren effective public servant running race her real time routing corruption propelled big victory yesterday yet 
think anyone else world ever brutally savaged billionaire bad 
warren needs stay it's versus biden think establishment made big mistake going right continue rack delegates go bernie probably get forward if liz pool together they debate march also looking like tulsi next take progressive movement that's path wing party 
she really got flash like arrow 
her taking bloomberg great doubt but chips took super pac money 
its behind scenes shot last episode arrow grant gustin goofing around front oliver queen dc character 's grave definitely real funeral 
here's another silver lining yesterday voter turnout surged it way higher states this bodes well democrats november https www vox com policy politics super tuesday results voter 
the fact yesterday got vote woman would make best president generation huge positive when went voting booth looked names took second really soak candidates dropped long time ago still ballot not around cast first idea seeing calibre diversity roster would've unthinkable it felt like important moment history voting warren knowing person well qualified list made happy of course wish people saw things way paid less attention polls stopped trying guess electable skeptical experts but regardless decides race she'll play role shaping platform that alone worth feeling 
not relative net worth unfortunately 
look difference million seconds billion recognize billions the money spent wave dick around literally amounts pocket change 
still can't believe sc debate audience booed 
as usual woman hard background work open path men succeed classic 
dude allowed bend rules run smh took lot vote count 
hopefully bezos zuck jack tech bros scared away 
it's unfortunate bloomberg turned right around gave endorsement and likely sizable check biden which come surprise seeing massively sort wealth tax attempt go wealthy way senator warren if liz throws towel leaves us either toxicity sanders campaign middle road candidate dnc could find i'll probably stay home 
what spent rest money ads annoy everyone 
she also went racist record well 
she may win nomination plenty time left run pres whereas sanders likely retire 
i'm really disappointed state colorado got one delegate bloomberg he percent voters think lot otherwise warren ended voting bernie instead 
they never see forest trees

use wrong word much the searching envious and absolutely nothing conversation that said daily wear watch probably cost make months i'm ok 
we already exit tax warren raising 
sure numbers wealth tax hurts like population helping rarely get policy explicitly helps practically everyone tempering necessary with grab much 
my issue much bezos pays whether warren's plan prevent anyone crossing billion future to line someone enough afford every luxury could ever want reasonable cap and sounds like would prevented stealing wealth anyway right before got divorced meaning leaving billion almost even still stole employees rule certainly bezos' case zuckerberg likely user base unlawfully data although lot 
vat would raise three times amount wealth tax all european nations tried repealed favor rich exploited hiding purchase easier identify instead already 
european countries still switzerland actually makes money one issue wealth taxes europe much easier avoid taxes american it apple oranges comparison given can't move ireland say live pay irish french warren's healthcare plan includes methods sureing irs go ultra wealthy

the fact guy peddling per month ubi also one really want talk wealth taxes give idea much money they're hoarding top percent like jeff bezos going hour minimum obviously hey let's crumbs come looking bag cookies but christ they've gotta whole factory back everyone chump change 
the best case scenario switzerland generates tax revenue wealth us less half warren's yr projection also considered international https www investopedia com ask answers switzerland asp so offset plethora benefits that means rich tolerate benefit laws in corporations much less compliant generate increase cost administration enforce compliance 
billionaires known fairly aggressive investing strategies though they enough assets put considerable number risky portfolios 
isn't rule thumb safe rate withdrawal much principal spend year without needing worry running dry this distinct average return reason needs account recessions explicitly smooths bumps so billionaire live middle upperclass lifestyle forever interest like half percent wealth give flying flip 
it's strawman one worked hard oppose there thing billionaire millionaire definitely get guillotines billionaires naturally evil they're rich job come system fixes fairly billionaires even agree much both bernie warren supporters for wealth tax 
https givingpledge org pledger aspx id billionaires signed pledge give away wealth rich people automatically bad some lot money it's job create system recycled efficiently rest us even agree that's looking forward tax 
admit i'm economist anything knowledge exactly would happen make impossible billionaire limited guess main point taxes place cause maximum good society got whole tax thing that's essentially mean made hard some people seem angry billionaires think bring lot if optimal plan means exist fine there also might reasons equality example step carefully risk driving rich business owners businesses america and yes base policy person moves revenue get that based careful research planning arbitrary limit set platitudes 
what good capital country spent 
we aware give info please 
there difference warren sanders' wealth taxes while effect growth shrinkage neither plan prevent someone crossing staying threshold particularly fast bezos' zuckerberg's fortunes 
and disproportionally hurt average person rich vats insanely regressive terrible policy 
that wont intended effect near term rich spend money 
states already desperately exploiting path 
because people want improve things care less money and candidates poll well trump yeah gonna cheat probably chance right your trolling change anything though stick know are talking san gabriel valley used live actually 
also whole line difficult people net worth tied assets instead cash who cares lack liquidity justification poor pay taxes really give hoot sell rd malibu mansion year you know money due already personal accountant kind dough there literally excuse able 
how best case scenario number based country wealthiest person billion dollars wealth america makes switzerland richest people look like peasants 
using scenario person responded laid best guess safe market returns my point can't take average maintain wealth let alone increase but look warren buffet's thoughts it's incredibly hard continually beat he even bet hedge fund director would outgain choice buffett famously able fairly consistently reading hours per week needed capital people polling money together investment strategy 
yes agree said i'm merely trying point op suggesting billionaires could live really case 
it's job decide money gets put back system benefit society writ large the billionaires pledge fine idea hardly left notions charity use 
know i'm getting attacked someone thread agree merely billion dollars makes terrible human he even told belong left go become moderate the idea impossible billionaire imo heavy handed every penny make taken away since fails account fact lot things wrong lot parts society business person capable approaching mark it like crossing speed light slamming brick wall and organic upping taxes toward gets close why able bring kind money first place at point much value provide world single handedly worth thousand doctors that tax plan based careful research planning arbitrary limit people set platitudes problem concept it's pretty hard without adding we already ability estimate brought use individual pay cannot however calculate whether it'll lead billionaires criminally avoiding exit illegally living non extradition country want predict loopholes wealthy find simple target ultra rich minimize might ok 
yeah leave lot money government acts like sold stuff sends tax bill it's aggressive right selling taxes profit may still think worth taking penalty cost transaction country case https americansoverseas org en knowledge centre us liability exit 
you never seen yacht entire industries rely wealthy people 
percent measure proportion not absolute value 
and greatly appreciate correction duly corrected of course i'm pretty sure even billionaire find million year worth depreciating non recoverable assets spend money entire scenario inherently absurd irreverent 
so let's say powerball got really high one day like and even buy ticket aunt bought but holy shit you how long evil quickly divest money going political hell since philanthropy tax write especially right never pay taxes actually take bag burn become good is way able use improve society keep evil naturally bathe get voting for anyone every single candidate sides presidential election least couple billionaire backers fully support agenda clearly wealth redistribution ok supports accuse idea billionaires divisive originating major left camp 
the person responded said can't think examples learned give back provided counter example really responding thread reply make much sense context fwiw agree doesn't mean steve markoff bernie supporting billionaire literally jobs publicly ridiculed philanthropy made fun bill gates trying help world 
at least blew networth campaign that's like median household spent my car repair hurt times harder bloomberg trying buy primary 
really hoping momentum leads warren included polls punditry analysis etc there much ignoring current third place delegate count favor candidates none 
count yet not trying stir shit totally realistic it's warren rip people backing may well care suspect either hurt badly nothing mean blunts growith it'll simply impact meaning could keep rising future 
made meme https redd ixnd jpg 
i'm pete fan wanted stop say excellent watch liz smashing bloomberg yesterday huge 
bernie supporter liz dragging bloomberg satisfying moment debates far 
i'm happy warren what statement 
it nice see old fire back 
boooooooom the sound supporters dropping like bad habit 
yeah but millions people making memes car repairs have ever paid hundreds dollars willingly get shamed harvard law professor public 
yeah warren win bloomie spent portion wealth losing campaign 
something something percent people afford emergency expense 
keep thinking much money could helped new voter registration gotv infrastructure ticket candidates 
and let's frank much emphasis put two white states look like actual democratic base thus buttigieg's klobuchar's numbers get inflated believe withstand diverse voting electorate 
true never say politics trump but probably dented growth support might've got overtake sanders 
count yet not trying stir shit totally realistic fair point remember trump's campaign ended access hollywood tape came 
feel like lot support polls came low information voter saw 's ads put joining hip obama now he's exposed think number deflates some biden moving bloomberg might go back another candidate 
love increase memes sub last weeks these much fun 
what separate post meme people enjoy 
you guys always polite thanks 
pete's best line night imo careful end two polarizing candidates neither democrats that's verbatim get point he made good let's nominate democrat

maybe bloomberg weird findom kink part plan 
he spending try make sure pay wealth tax it investment 
smashed ins't word would personally used yes money well spent 
ha sure know far commendable investment 
hang around sub trashing candidate stop and would self identify bernie bro 
i'm middle aged bernie warren harris guy knock teenage edgelord dipshit serious business let electoral process play bit resist urge stick dick welcome 
but probably dented growth support might've got overtake sanders i'm certain either the kind person likes bloomberg likely like warren bernie anyway that said personally i'd okay overtook sanders neither preference think represents significantly bigger electoral risk 
feel like lot support polls came low information voter saw 's ads put so i'm gonna go ahead quote another thread since said almost thing nate silver tweeting incessantly explaining case people assume he's solely well money totally misunderstanding politics influence advertising actually works and add work you can't make bad product blanketing world even good people bloomberg moderate experience joe biden ok copied bit back talking know pretty much everyone sub think last sentence reason bloomberg important understand voters way we race clear majority 
findom is like femdom if surprised ever plus way warren towers makes believable 
lol sometimes invest purely fortunately he's smart enough trump 
smashed ins't word would used cool neither they wrote shamed 
this probably troll someone saying poor way progressive candidates get ignored disparaged main news channels 
glad see someone bernie camp call we need conscious negativity regardless source 
think biden see bump longer conservative candidate option basically everyone liz joe seemed moderate bernie mike stage 
life taking risks trump strong people want think the demographics america shifted lot since sanders voters voted that's automatically voter loss 
people like bloomberg he's moderate experience joe biden because painted ads but last night found really centrist even center right former republican endorsed bush whole host skeletons closet he definitely got biden's support also set message unchallenged carpet bombing now vetted expect drop and voters go back pick another candidate altogether

yeah buying line reasoning life taking risks would hilarious campaign slogan sanders though 
life taking risks that's really related anything saying all i'm trying say draw big conclusions bloomberg debate trump strong people want think and something know anyone else it's objective truth one knows sure that said smart money like nate silver agree he's automatically right either trust offense the demographics america shifted lot since not still pretty similar sanders voters voted voter loss what no just went bernie trump mean they're gonna go back time 
people like bloomberg he's moderate experience joe biden because painted ads sorry blunt if look record publically available places website generally leaning left fact i'm saying reasons someone could heck anything anyone else feel wanna but gonna suggest reason support incorrect take nate silver now vetted expect drop and voters go back pick another candidate altogether this entire conversation stems count know whether impact want anyway 
that's well good obvious comments opinion based think bloomberg better shot beating trump touch he republican 
that's well good obvious comments opinion based think bloomberg better shot beating trump touch no i'm at and that's really gonna rest argument admitting everything going suggest totally valid even remotely beyond realm possibility sure wanna continue conversation absolutely beat trump thinking he's got bernie common sense least everywhere except reddit people obsessed bernie sanders he republican so we're talking if nominee him republican hurts path become once past arguably benefit drawback also years he's donated far democrats republicans pinning thing like bad try pin warren 
i'm saying act like know 
and yet acting like know 
and yet acting like know no i'm in fact i've explicitly said otherwise multiple times get disagree pov mischaracterize position defend 
this beyond pointless tedious goodbye 
but are you going to raise taxes 
republicans corporations prefer pay premiums taxes 
taxes premiums er visit let's forget without insurance 
understand people think saying paraphrased overall cost less avoiding question the issue always who cares tax increase saving hundreds medical costs health insurance employer still pay month plus copays deductible anything way save money medicare would literally went doctor year check that's even possible since psychiatrist least every months all want debates sound bite warren raising taxes playing game 
if we're getting weeds really cannot say sure everyone see savings some people going greater tax increase lowering premiums however mostly struggling afford health insurance likely that's medicare all many major benefit reality situation news outlets like cnn deliberately trying poison voters' minds lower cost per capita warren repeatedly arguing along bernie invoking question it pisses end focused issue framed around saving costs ultimately reducing care bankruptcies oh mention actually doctor without worry changing coverage networks paying co pays ass 
if taught statistics high school math classes would already medicare all cost variance stressful humans slightly higher much less variable cost gee sure nice know need put aside taxes guess find later give proper freakout 
this poor argument demonstrates little understand medicare if take total healthcare spending spread existing tax base expect double cost premiums depending income assuming yr overall savings imo assumption given much care avoidance exists also speak fact minorities spend considerably less single payer plan arguably institutional racism design the providing people need it saving money lives economic windfall boomers sick working class wonders life expectancy 
one point last night got frustrated line questions towards warren debate literally yelled television turned cnn blows debates joke no actually gets single issue baiting sound bites 
with bernie's plan would pay and assuming elizabeth warren's fine no uncertainty whether something covered need delay treatment sometimes doctor works things insurance company spend time deciding employer's health care plans every year worry lose job crazy cobra price importantly less fortunate dying due lack empathy lacking we live cities sick people street mental current situation good 
how much joe biden plan cost he idea even taken time calculate pete same thing but media lets get away pretends liz warren honest unless says taxes go rather costs it bunch bull makes feel good moderate candidates want avoid going presidential election 
she say yes stephen colbert many others tried giving answer it looks bad admitting even though overall lower costs 
warren evasive point takes seriously candidate the sound bite yes we're raising taxes could kill candidacy it's frustrating that's politics 
mean would less argument actually proposed tax pay even suggestions it's fact financing unclear 
she stick meme podium next debate 
guys lets real everyone knows americans really want ability choose blood sucking parasite extracts wealth system denying coverage healthiest individuals kneecapped medicare forced cover sickest without adequate funding as long choice matter truly counts 
one point last night got frustrated line questions towards warren debate literally yelled television turned cnn blows debates joke no actually gets single issue baiting sound bites 
bernie flat stated taxes go last night asked can't warren 
can anyone explain dragging feet explaining details like keeps coming 
yeah that's premiums mine last job deductible 
one thing also factored conversation cost time canadian friends recently moved states they work big tech companies best healthcare plans money buy without fail bring stress calling dealing insurance takes that if burden wealthy singles twenties imagine like average middle low class family in canada even something think crosses mind single payer debate way every party across entire political spectrum supports this case every country implemented 
love bernie warren curious either plans handles situation right employers cover medical benefits before income company average costs per employee month larger companies families should happen employer take add taxes however think going keep money thereby lowering we're require i'm certain basically big steal employees ps russian troll 
support donate buttigieg warren love warren's policies concern comes health care here simplified take comparing who want it both awwi promise lower overall costs provide universal healthcare access to implement need pass bill reverse trump's tax cuts wealthy sanders' wealth pay majority another increase taxes roll imposed middle class unless done executive power constitutional test proposed due questions regarding constitutionality plan likely face legal challenge us supreme court so even gets passed tied manage huge transition private insurance industry people assets eliminated transformed massive state owned run medicare operation within four years looking long list things would get coverage seems daunting road block along way really american personally think wise come instead going this consistent wanting deliver results less risky sick waiting 
supreme chancellor trump lose reign capitalism always prevail rich people like continue thrive worked mind bloody peasants 
why ever call moderators they're trying frame question 
when answer straightforward question multiple times still said debate 
who tf paying annually premiums 
so question guys i'm military healthcare tricare provided employer military pay premiums already yet warren bernie's plan although honest taxes go how beneficial health insurance like 
come fight argue really looking information feel like warren would bad personally though could wrong if wife make around annually one dependent currently pay month health insurance max copays warren's us think buttigieg sure floated increase taxes plan obviously that's lot things income level just based i've read heard seems cost family thousands appreciate clarity thanks edit interesting got downvoted genuinely seeking not big deal good look people info preferred candidate 
but taxes go to government and government bad free enterprise market place of ideas good 
exactly what bunch morons center issues sometimes thing two solutions always better solution nothing private insurance people medicare all cheaper 
exactly easy obvious find odd say when immediately jumps costs every time yes taxes may go depending income level people healthcare savings far outweigh increased an lack nuance candidate got board 
think honest explaining like really we know math people want honesty 
cnn buttgieg trump gop's work 
yeah ones things sure know trust government efficiently allocate resources 
please research she bright spot dismal political climate 
exactly that's line would take 
warren cave medicare all becomes nominee 
the part equation tell pay healthcare taxes every claim insurance company ultimately deducted anyway subsidize assholes get rid stop losing revenue money currently amass little scam stays economy 
don forget follow questions say yes much going raise taxes middle class that opening path 
republicans corporations prefer pay premiums taxes then get pocket corporate subsidies come rolling 
it's dril tweet far depressing 
how many hours spend year finding new doctor treatment current insurance double checking doctor's covered next year's policy long enough second part doctors fell coverage last would pay extra worry but offering cheaper 
this people often forget adds need any regular care even life event like new child cost thousands pocket month premiums its tough see value young healthy understand disgusting retiree medicare medicaid already pay next nothing meanwhile working day mid career employers carrying lions share burden fwiw lived england years ago year paid taxes queen they nhs you still us deduct government interesting note get refund though included bill near identical countries 
then throw treatments covered plans hassle prior authorization plan limitations suffering months step therapy work failing everything treatment except original md suggested first damn place insurance companies dictate medical 
yea nonstop taxes question unbelievably dishonest cnn sickening glad stayed tough focused total cost 
agree yea they're saying avoiding question giving sound bite want you say 'your taxes go up' answering 
totally agree fact talking taxes cost matters missing point plays directly republican points biden says plan costs billion compared trillion count likely actually trillions warren totaled mentions discusses much americans also pay premiums copays deductibles ignores completely talks and media lets get away the conversation worth one overall having said think would better acknowledged raising pivot discussion misses good 
yeah attempt misinformation know media report honestly explain american people puts money working people's pockets they'll play taxes going sound bite 
thanks pointing people save money some voters single younger rarely make use doctors prescriptions gotten sick years do support medicare yes think disingenuous keep repeating costs go middle class families talk low income households specific tax brackets adversely affected also as warren uses proof total cost matters budget this means need know going come flow back budgets bernie clears nicely without providing bad sound bite imo one would okay taking brunt taxes meant better healthcare everyone aggregate level however smart strategy seems appreciate commentary there intentional omission information evasion important defending away it addressed point 
doesn't matter buttgieg wanted seen moderate rise points polls warren's expense 
part worry many voters actually know much taxes increased pay elizabeth warren informed us high intends rate extremely expensive plan trillion annually this particularly worrying numerous people low yearly medical costs if presidential candidate proposes spending ought explain they're going has sanders suffered giving sound bite raised middle class think appreciate honesty straightforwardness even support 
not everybody goes doctor pays taxes it's valid question ask going raise the way fund medicare system tax everyone in opinion defense middle class voters agree paying slight increase everyone use as classical liberal concern force doctors va closest example horribly managed that's good thing 
we also live society whole point supposed take care this country obsessed individuality entire started tribes living community benefit 
mention people actually see doctor without worry changing coverage networks paying co pays ass love insurance premium cute seen nice deductible 
how estimate full single payer national insurance plans better employer money regular wage salary income start box dd paid premiums add this may attached paystubs much spent pocket healthcare prescriptions copays deductibles dental vision divide total add sources gross multiply get percentage if less tax would apply directly replacing pay plan financially 
this key point hard make clear presidential debate for example people employer sponsored insurance see taxes go since currently paying end losing money on whole medicare certainly save true every single person 
we make good estimates based known healthcare spending using ranges costs savings plotting revenue derrived average tax base know instance year old retiree paying roughly yr spend considerably less taxes income retired years worker per the overall share skews dramatically toward sick single payer switches so essentially everyone pay but access care essential preserving life need meanwhile economic security receive 
good point something open clear ideally could thoughtfully explain disproportionately improve financial situation older population demographic make significant gains 
feel like sub good ourpresident shits warren tries divide progressives it infuriating used bernie bumper sticker totally supported he's second choice seeing conduct badly incredibly frustrating we need others' backs if gets nomination supporters back vice versa example https www np reddit com ourpresident comments dirxvh decided clean graphic bit seems utm medium android app source share 
thank bernie one best candidates pleasure considering field while warren excited campaign he's nominee 
sometimes think warren shielding since still year away one win matters 
that depends tax structure goes we able drive per capita spending gives us opportunity overall costs consumers right employer provided coverage pay period every two weeks around picks since provides considerable savings employers amount revenue come employees basically replace month plan something could good new bad burden falls rather and warren said vote anything like ladder 
what mean ellen important climate change immigration cnn disagrees 
bernie managed straightforward saying going pay medicare all money democratic field honest clearly kill campaign could reason warren evasive actually believe seems like plausible answer considering statement 
the two cent tax proposed would cover 
what i've seen plans basically flat income tax plus payroll employer side roughly replacing lot big employers pay already the balance made higher taxes rich future cost savings pharma providers likely taking haircut efficiency gains 
don't forget health insurance ad right went 
my guess trying avoid clip saying taxes go played infinite loop scare boomers tv 
she want give republican sound bite think pretty crappy candidates trying work but agree point say raise explain good deal americans 
because number people saw refuse give sound bite last night smaller would see republican ad 
makes point every time asked question problem media wants ask yes isnt none going let spin half policy needs look whole 
she want give clip republicans saying going raise taxes the media many politicians treat like ultimate evil ignore payments made premiums copays deductibles play game making tax dirty word having said acknowledge explain good thing 
give people ads attack general election smart though think say fuck here's cheaper even get taxed 
warren ok yes plan middle class taxes go cancelled eliminating insurance industry premiums copays deductibles profit taking the money peace mind billion tv digital ads big government liberal liz warren wants to raise taxes on millions of middle class families under protect your family vote trump remember endless context clips obama saying build it would 
camp agree it take genius realize deflecting refusing say taxes go just effing hate bernie least honest saying premiums resulting net savings she coming disingenuous plan understand 
there thing premiums technically you pay health insurance artificially lower likely would directly come federal budget imagine situations could raise wage people like cost given previously subsidizing healthcare 
it beneficial dod pay tricare one benefits keeping service 
amazing plan covers everyone would never argue already good health care therefore one else deserves you correct military benefits replaced accompanied increase pay there private going superior power monopsony unless survival fittest society people born wrong families die every year cant afford 
if wife make around annually one dependent currently pay month health insurance max copays would warren's bad us does include premium deductible paying yr healthcare although set stone yet bernie plan proposes tax that come looks like saving money medicare all buttigieg others fear mongering anything 
insurance company would fuck heartbeat profit threatened you also taking consideration deductible likely increase premium looking medicare all wealthy let honest target warren mostly focus tax look around many people and think time president pay attention system currently supporting make big structural change sure everyone gets help need feel like philosophical question rather numbers 
with government job pay paycheck health insurance but pays check that shy year people wrong worry exactly taxes change vastly rate much society currently paying 
just wanted follow downvoted question warren actually released calculator today along proposal pay feel free plug numbers see work https elizabethwarren com medicare 
because sound bite saying taxes would go context impact overall costs cut soundbite played repeatedly fox ads funded rnc hospitals insurance companies 
you mean like one say tax cuts wealthy helps economy 
that would biggest flip flop history politics disastrous candidacy you're delusional think conniving 
your understanding taxes laughable it's subsidy companies deduct cost business tax profits gross receipts 
my wife got dinged last year lab work hospital network doctor works error you lose healthcare game try next week 
my boyfriend going right he needs take part sleep study his snoring become control keep us getting need point taking severe toll relationship working lives got recommendation therapist insurance company work recommended doctor however specific plan one top plans offers cover so see what actual fuck private know profit 
it matter anyway i've couple surgeries last two years spent hours asking everyone network please tell much insurance would cover i'd hook they told impossible know procedure like choice found month later anesthesiologist even though hospital else got stuck bill spite one cadillac plans the worst part bulk fee actually sensible motherfuckers charged little plastic stents healthcare system bullshit 
remember got list certain type specalists network area most taking new patients least dead numbers then finally went doctor told using old even though they sent me that list 
changed son's primary care doctor one closer new home apparently also network without realizing tried taking urgent care last week turned away it frustrating used website insurance entered find facility say anything 
obama i'm absolutely confident two years every nation earth run women would see significant improvement across board everything if look world problems usually old men getting way 
he also said democrats running good old ideas like higher minimum wage new medicare giving workers seats corporate boards reversing egregious tax cuts make sure college students graduate debt free https www latimes com business lazarus la fi obama medicare story html sounds signaling support warren 
hypothetically yeah think republican women soul shrivels like flaccid dick imagine woman senator running shit they're better 
it unquestionable president obama extremely cerebral pragmatic man thinks deeply speaks would wary reading endorsement sen warren he's foolish enough think interpreted lens primary either making earlier remarks going far left least mind seen positive one thing this listens acts general good he bush railroaded agenda day never deviated thrives information makes based knows decision due sometimes decisions retrospect sometimes but cannot accuse seeking challenge assumptions thought right anyone tries paint one dimensional fail 
that sounds like soft endorsement as long he's putting chips behind biden i'm happy 
posted politics got removed off topic 
that pretty pointed the news trying discount saying well foreign country etc but strikes someone knows matter says something always going get noticed so think deny telling old men race what location remove potential message exact words said 
just endorse damn the trolls going call duh system rigged matter wins primary 
then run hillary genuinely curious two train thoughts go 
sarah palin susan collins margaret thatcher i'm woman liked obama please make competent people women know gop why still 
is explaining away didnt change he needed ovaries wouldve raised taxes wealthy ended forever wars held firm unions im sorry one reasons liz great understands problems structural its decent people positions power way entire system works 
wow actually fantastic news if liz wanted take biden pegs totally throw next debate 
sounds like subtle hint biden 
what says two different things 
i'd rather world ran democrats one republican women 
when history ever war female rulers opposing sides 
obama endorsing candidate nomination despite overwhelming support clinton endorse beaten sanders 
georgia election presidential primary registration deadline https registertovote sos ga gov gaolvr welcome back button february www mvp mvp march april may general october november 
would love know obama thinks the power one best books 
cough damn seen whole quote 
you retired barry there need pander anymore 
look alabama abortion ban signed law women if dont change system matter whos charge 
obama displaying subtle sexism low expectations 
if truly feels concede hillary 
thanks obama would also love leader stops droning third world countries expand military budget like every president whatever gender 
women chance surely men way long enough think time 
thought obama recently criticizing sanders warren hardline medicare 
long live marine le pen gender everything barack i'm offended man seriously edit why downvotes if female candidate wins france things going get better that's fact literally sexist 
lol andrew yang solid comment last debate response https youtu ad nvfngp 
just clear quote year ago really taken kind comment current primary 
obama endorse signal support candidate he'll whoever comes primary 
couldn also supporting sanders comment sounds like pushing progressive agenda general 
love warren far female politicians shitty male way great shows women capable men 
if anything recent comments would probably see aligning biden pete amy they're swinging far left alienating voters https www cnn com politics obama warns candidates reality index html 
or read anything margaret thatcher conservative women like cop consistently great pressure demonstrate weak usually resulting draconian male counterparts 
this quote year ago likely throw back bernie trump vs clinton 
kind sticky wicket know discouraged biden running probably want narrative media obama rejects vp president shit honestly understand wanting jump it'll endless talk chose person derail issues hand least little longer 
yeah always cringe statements like one obama made take england example theresa may margaret thatcher bad male conservative leaders the problem lot women minorities would make great get chance biases but female minority leadership automatically someone better warren improvement trump person leader not 
exactly my support nothing woman think going try best make america better place live people that's want candidate 
sure woman massive bonus we need break topmost glass ceiling we're telling women society things let 
think obama stating realty us get see when took business management course years back materials women scoring higher every meaningful management metric whether communication organization prioritization business goals empathy professional development directs etc they better managers across board how square much representation upper political office 
counterpoint female candidates appear equally meritorious man actually much stronger invisible obstacles overcome reach place being accomplished female patriarchal system absolutely positive trait accomplishment face adversity 
counterpoint start thinking woman meritorious quality 
the patriarchy full effect politics recently pointed male potus zero female desire see inequality decrease called sexist advocating women thing men two hundred odd years 
you really think obama endorse anyone biden style centrist 
the system rigged though there's verifiable proof certain candidates progressive ones get less coverage media negative centrist democratic 
you're really giving we're going make obama one term president republicans pass the guy tried give people affordable healthcare called fucking anti christ 
good lord tired people rewritting sort tragedy president obama delivered left shit ton monumental successes top republican congress obstructionist degree lightyears beyond anything democrat faced century and coming office biggest existential threat global economy last so world brink disaster opposition trying stop everything wants pass how reversed 'global gag rule' allowing us aid go organizations regardless whether provide abortions pulled troops iraq drew troop numbers afghanistan policy barring media coverage return fallen soldiers dover air force base appointed two liberal supreme court justices including first latina passed largest healthcare overhaul since medicare oversaw radical shift treatment lgbtq extending benefits sex partners federal employees ended don't ask tell he president endorse marriage equality gay legalized watch openly officials history fucking recession without millions losing jobs like predicted and created private sector entire bush years passage dodd frank banking reforms among things prohibited banks engaging proprietary trading bank's money turn profit often conflict customers' interests raised fuel efficiency standards get us cleaner cars enacted clean power plan cut national emissions ratified paris climate accords provided billion new funding individuals with disabilities education act signed family smoking prevention tobacco control giving fda authority regulate manufacturing marketing sale tobacco time lilly ledbetter fair pay restoring basic protections pay discrimination women workers children's health insurance reauthorization provides health care million kids previously uninsured issued executive order repeal era restrictions embryonic stem cell research christopher dana reeve paralysis piece comprehensive legislation aimed improving lives americans living paralysis weapons systems acquisition reform fraud wasteful spending defense procurement contracting system stopped police obtaining military grade arsenals there's lot http whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar com 
sounds like bernie needs ovaries exact platform years decades 
obama president drove gop current state 'we block everything get way' he also deal prevent recession help global economic collapse without changes made spite republican obstruction liz bernie would joke candidates 
https qz com throughout history women rulers likely wage war men tl dr isabella beast female less trust anyone view subordinates pawns since rarely lead front 
hillary never real chance winning presidency she charismatic enough 
quick questions which branch government controls military's budget coming near decade war two foreign countries general public view troops ground versus assets air time bonus question happened region drastically stepped 
true they replace word women working class 
bad women worse good men calculation it's whether obama broadly believes general would make better leaders all talk individual conservative outright evil they're counterexamples ignores due opportunity something else many male power throughout history significantly 
bernie's stood what's right sure one actually got progressive things done shorter period time liz by landslide https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments dxmqvx support scares aciml utm source share medium ios app name iossmf 
though also clear submitted bbc article is today 
lol old quote made comment week saying need stop far left 
considering obama said privately bernie running away nomination would speak stop waiting https www politico com news magazine barack obama democrats candidates biden politico i'm going go no 
might disagree show lawsuit alleges woman politics ever raped year old looked away students molested doctor habitually used campaign funds buy private flights various affairs blamed husband children eventually pleading guilty 
the comment women happened today yesterday 
yeah that's still minority among bunch men what half senate collins instead 
i've said earlier thread guess needs restating underestimating unfashionable manner incredible reselliance many women leaders west since thatcher like single handedly proved demographics centuries disparaged even breadwinners first time good queen bess decisive visionary damn determined ill men particularly facing argentina arthur scargill previous four pms backed caved to progressives another conservative monster put enough cabinet campaign feminism british white working class restored national pride they've long forgotten across globe formidable adversary could make sure never face we say shipped jobs away cruel close ton coal mines simply disrespectful history deny began strong trend premiereship western world hillary running without place it's beyond undeniable impact british politics international landscape just please watch recent bbc series year pm right proper research really resulted change heart part overall opinion bigger picture ways surprised it helps looking uniquely modern lens leaning party country bad guys left pary huge disservice anyones ability evaluate historical context understand trust approach shaped ideological predispositions built us college years old trusty whetstone seemingly perfectly serviced sword took shake brief moments surveying contexts quite different honedtly absolutely worth suggest getting foot water less divisive figures angela merkel going also use certain issues important similar arguments anchor points for instance shutting favor better energy sources conservatives used demand modernize staunchly opposed costs why fascinating investigate clear head regardless likely find mind changed much present become harder revisions clouding one's judgement way vs evil narratives think fellow countrymen stupid brainwashed easier past conditions changes set motion current mode thought found healthy adjustment 
think much clearer saying old men get way let women lead 
according politico article wanted standard bearer organically materialize without outside influence putting thumb scale he also critiques every candidate weaknesses view told so like went full blown yoda seems settled political darwinism best way forward 
did really discourage biden running where'd hear 
how know discouraged biden running trust veracity reporting nyt believe attempt divide dems 
agree reverse sexism stuff always cringey honestly surprised hear coming obama if generous comment though might interpret mean lived experiences woman underrepresented leadership across world giving voice would inherently make better place that said evaluating individual candidates office platform track record rank much higher demographic 
thatcher like single handedly proved demographics centuries disparaged women leaders even breadwinners first time since good queen bess decisive visionary damn determined ill men particularly facing argentina arthur scargill previous four pms backed caved to progressives another conservative monster put enough cabinet campaign feminism british white working class restored national pride they've long forgotten across globe formidable adversary could make sure never face we say shipped jobs away cruel close ton coal mines simply disrespectful history deny began strong trend premiereship western world hillary running without place it's beyond undeniable incredible impact british politics international landscape 
nothing automatically makes someone better evidence accomplishments person's merit quality making accomplishment female harder male due endemic sexism invisible barriers therefore increase assessment impressiveness accomplishments made 
would still supporting warren but shore shell plus bailey woof 
i've got say politics typically pretty good every ugly racism sexism homophobia see rest reddit rears head 
mean see coming choosing candidate fact one gender wrong case 
yes think obama much progressive give credit lacks boldness warren sanders instead favoring incremental steps toward progress which understandable imo given political capital expended pass affordable care act 
obama endorse person becomes nominee and want preferred candidate would serve well bring persuasive case table calling competitors centrists done 
republican obstructionism horrible obamas instincts areas bad he wanted entitlement reform we're lucky never got joe also made like bush tax cuts permanent deal went harry reids head to blame mistakes obama years solely mistake but original point seems making statement old white men werent power everything would hunky dory fact women helm american system thats completely dysfunctional rotting 
unlike psychopaths support malignant narcissist us left feel perfectly comfortable criticizing whomever occupies presidency 
obama basically trust corporate centrist leadership era he insanely talented style powerless mcconnel scorched earth obstructionism sacking treasury modern robber barons we need anti corruption candidate new deal mindset age 
cool he also didnt even try half campaigned and much list either good stuff doesnt address underlying structural issues something nice meantime completely washed away trump executive orders also wouldnt cool threw bankers jail you know ones tanked economy first place that would really im saying obama worst president ever bad but fail restructure corrput crony capitalist system whats far worse never tried let citigroup essentially pick cabinet absolute sea organizers couldve called upon nation wide try drum support dems lose supermajority instead dissolved dnc ran party seats dirt isnt villain point things diminish failures

they may misspelled name replacing 
i'm progressive considering supporting warren if followers dislike jacobin use terms like alt left think may reconsider support clearly year old female wrong place am do feel would better stay lane wants green new deal free college etc mean tone sub deride people perhaps vote needed just let know

noo actually running trump which biden campaign based 
life serious enough if can't laugh else 
you'll need votes dirt bag left might want dial hostility unless prefer chase centrist voters 
as lefty man referring high degree hostility toward women especially candidates noticed dialoguing politics many men join us favoring progressive policies many economics environmental issues deep seated loathing powerful seen times count frankly find disgusting by means left quite large number are suggesting ever no hostile have invective hurled elizabeth see even aoc shake head 
going grant anyone respect reasonable presidential candidate if go way demean put think coming table anyways

read comment senator lipton the office voice 
brett kavanaugh allowed angry dr ford women grow hearing makes us unattractive well today plan use anger take back house senate put democrats charge are 
this took back house she retweet response biden 
legit one reasons like cause never tries nice if pissed fact 
what's like brag raking dollars and getting bitches models good bad okay mad if flashin' dollas i'd bitch baller they'd paint so i'm patriarchy 
fuck yeah great response channel 
may minority cis gendered white male y'all right ain't nothing wrong angry lady dude y'all kick ass take what's 
apologists going go like fart wind mad paying attention even average person something do 
this favorite topic mine social expectation comes i'm guy's girl get ton passes goodness men women life different even sometimes 
the kicker men allowed cry like women angry kavanaugh crying year old lost ice cream still got seat 
ugh first response disgusting he either knew avoiding point completely missed way disgrace humanity 
allowed angry wth even mean 
oh huh even read attack warren saw commentary followers candidates 
so something ew campaign put you tell poor quality image whoever posted us came 
mind angry want really believe 
little bit dated already house might want fact check 
that definitely needs one warren's campaign songs already 
that reminds halsey song sings man telling smile tells owe goddamn thing 
we minority obvious see women people sad hard enough default many men let bias go 
wonder things would gone differently dr blaise ford unapologetically angry 
if man gets angry righteous anger passionately defending this defense kavanagh little bitch fit stand woman throwing hissy tantrum shrewish hysterical etc 
do link retweet toward biden can't find 
https www cnn com politics elizabeth warren joe biden sexism charges index html 
no she would dismissed angry unattractive woman 
guess depends race man there's definitely angry black stereotype passionate defense perceived anger situations we see time sports 
says one if look perspective he's falsely accused literal rape public th hour confirmation supreme court mean honestly going tell anger justified scenario pretty heartless thing say ford angry assuming understand would reasonable well but tweet almost perfect example cognitive dissonance like ignoring hate kavanaugh got handwaving something allowed wtf how everyone feel emotion begrudge anyone emotions they're 
this tweet speaking cultural norms general using instance example much specifics case whether justified us society lot rules men women supposed act accurate anger gets labeled bitch waved away must time month in contrast show emotion likely courageous praised he's fighter it goes way showing emotions men said weak soft pussies like ultimately warren taking would culturally frowned upon woman attempting turning positive standing right 
saying anger justified displayed inappropriate way demonstrating whole world impulsive history temperamental disposition make unfit sit highest court land 
jon lovett mourns warren if man race close but elizabeth 
full quote jon believe elizabeth warren would've extraordinary president crowd cheers one thought deeply much good person power presidency she run perfect campaign know also ran imperfect campaigns every single human got become if man primary close but say without feeling confident means nominee and swing state polls consistently showed tougher race trump either bernie biden understood might would best candidate frustrating supporters so i'm sad want live america woman finally hoenst misogyny expectations masculinity woven every facet culture news conversation keep get rid elect presdient that whose going come contested fucking convention pauses slowly bursts contested 
that episode pretty much warren rally 
it depressing fuck seeing sexism work people treated elizabeth that maybe part hardest time wake leaving race just face sexist country still wondering much longer wait see woman president 
does anyone know there's sub dedicated electing women ballot races it's important build movement local level 
contested convention now would interesting that's plan thought dropped but dropping part as one commentator put everyone loves elizabeth warren longer seeking power so people honest feel sad admission misogyny even among liberals progressives see either biden sanders moment citing health reasons what endorse pipe dream know kind left 
mourning warren want another old angry white man president republican democrat am alone that said vote blue matter 
alexa play the man taylor swift 
please these another group progressives sat sidelines one brilliant rant chris hayes worries joe bernie candidate never brought warren it widely lauded social media fellow saw irony folks miss hottakes 
tusli gabbard woman still running 
kind feel though sexism negative factor dispositive failure captivate democratic party think presented intellectually complex candidate people used seeing modern political discourse since probably hw defeated clinton hopefully thoughtful politicians eventually inoculate ever educated intelligent public simplistic one note messages future 
well think biden going get outright majority would cackle eternity contested convention scenario came 
is something even remotely possible not want get hopes kinda what would entail can anything make can't shake said fight righteous fights persist to 
wouldn't interesting prospect if neither biden sanders majority delegates candidates refuse release get together come compromise candidate elizabeth warren actually happened supporters might even board less would lost regardless think low probability happen however insist pick vp concession able modify platform order secure nomination that likely scenario 
it sure the whole panel loves liz much might well hand picked sub 
it discouraging see warren candidacy undone structural sexism exists country and say older white dude she never given megaphone press others the virtually boycotted iowa prior super tuesday would still remarkable bridge candidate believe ability take many progressive policies championed left applied pragmatic practical approach actually seeing implemented more could build maintain meaningful coalitions moderates centrists frankly necessary governance wish blood teeth floor stated creating cfpb subsequently displayed evisceration michael bloomberg live television admire unapologetically campaigning woman simultaneously excited able inspire next generation women leaders campaign begin lasting needed conversation around politics grateful retains platform united states senator please fall despair ideas public service somebody mentioned earlier prominent role writing something wholeheartedly get behind history side time but political progress usually measured decades election cycles don give persist 
we also saw racism double whammy misogyny play early exit amazingly qualified competent candidates like julian castro cory booker kamala harris why pete stay former mayors much larger cities wisdom experience drop attacked prosecution history get go hear amy's mistakes end there's large swaths democratic base want admit sexism still things limit people's achievements believe liberals progressives fall prey sexist racist thinking but three old white dudes running president 
one coworkers knew supported liz come multiple times past week saying things along lines warren's way the day dropped came said so huh despite canvassing efforts enough he's superior bite tongue reeeeeaaaallllyyyyy wanted go he type guy makes decisions politics based shallow perceptions without even getting details researching candidates thing like people vote woman pete gay man and supporting joe primary matter cannot 
what sort sexism loop asking earnest edit wtf wrong question like 
you could probably pitch voteblue 
lol peak fanfiction feels nice close eyes pretend moment maybe we'll chance 
they full white male arrogance thing hence six women ton mediocre white dudes thought could better job poc 
this would dimensional chess move almost buy cuz anyone going put pieces together need get done smartest person room sen warren 
her path forward relied unity candidate nominated contested convention but narrative work public perception needs main reason first place once bloomberg dropped think realized feasible 
i'm tuning november interested primary without elizabeth think would help shift attention ballot candidates congress important presidency especially senate if democrats retake deprive mcconnell majority big progress winning 
wow mv https www youtube com watch aqajlh wuz can imagine alternative universe elijah warren berniece sanders two progressive candidates would've crushed 
completely agree lost track number progressive senators glorified competent person hill dropped one stuck neck mattered all dual endorsements the organizations endorsed hours super tuesday voting started harry fucking reid 
lovett one seemed corner since last year give slack the rest

tulsi gabbard's problem elizabeth warren 
society sexist dem voters magically excluded the way discuss electability centered around assuming white male default electable so people voting buying racist construct i'm blaming scared trying go candidate feel safest bet calculate safe affected sexism 
this ultimately comedy podcast at times serious driven topics but shows often taped hollywood improv so think means wanted audience laugh depressing situation you know 
think lot everyone terrified losing election people would voted warren thought vote woman 
this less comedy podcast it recorded hollywood improv so take context and honestly years old sure runs think joe bernie would want serve two terms 
people stupid warren definitely winning angle invest heavily no one thing would never accuse inaccessible platform she knew communicate people could understand 
oh right forgot shut bernie sub four years ago get nomination 
it thought warren gone sanders sure fire victory 
the person votes win unless 
contested convention happen candidate wins majority delegates since two candidates left one bound get contested highly unlikely point the way large chunk voters post super tuesday states collectively decides vote dropped propels become viable passing threshold grab significant portion pledged 
contested convention like chance happening right according definitely get hopes though contested almost guarenteed go biden he's plurality delegate leader going which probably would 
lovett leave it comedy show lol contested convention possible though 
if remaining delegates split basically rest primary technically that assumes bloomberg buttigieg give biden warren's gabbard's roughly together bernie would need winning contest something like overall napkin math found gets majority 
can't see happening unless biden bernie unexpectedly die coronavirus even might get stuck bloomberg 
they're really smart well informed like us 
it's pretty wild small town gay mayor viability people listed but white man probably helps 
men get asked likable enough win gender start 
and admit much besides doubt either candidate enough humility would better president 
it may seem like long time remember general felt happened yesterday 
she longer unity candidate bernie supporters scorched earth moderates saw noped right why try unify someone progressives call snake worse frustrates end death progressive movement impossible purity test many people equated alpha omega current 
nearly million raised february dried and buy narrative continuing pull bernie supporters think super tuesday sanders already pulled going warren hence less desired showing i'm mind pulling handed biden nomination could wrong ceiling https thehill com homenews campaign warren says february amp 
omg love names picked yeah elijah would one likely become nominee joe biden still name even chance also dude taylor swift freaks much behind scenes video posted help sounds like normal self looks totally different person i'm surprised nightmare 
emily's list org comes mind think endorsed last remaining woman chance getting delegates it looks like want force choice amy klobuchar 
harry fucking reid endorsement week nevada would clyburn sized effect could propelled fourth place second least why mentor senate champion career sit watch get state there politicians show real political courage election cycle though many activists labor unions showed great i'm thinking julian castro endorsing warren dropping snubbing old obama administration colleague biden house members endorsed sanders heart attack media crowing demise official either really if indicates going run hope come together work elevate one congresspeople cabinet officials put line year think away without threat trump reelection fueling risk adversity four years filling oval office stench mediocrity times cynicism prevented probably ultimately leading race time 
the harry reid endorsement real tell biden win nomination democratic leadership regardless feel policies chosen oust trump wonder protege adam jentleson one warren's staunches supporters thought 
you could definitely read lines throughout season see really like warren trying stay somewhat neutral also hear crowd reactions live shows audience 
they really fantastic job staying neutral pissing everyone do wish would endorsed warren hell fucking yes but mean still love psa crooked media crooked's newsletters what day big tent highlights email inbox 
this forced neutrality earn us blomberg ticket one day when warren knife cuts knees good intended people propose care deeply democracy pundit trump 
that strawman reduction said ultimately inconsistent if anything called voters intelligent political discourse stupid what dominant paradigm campaigning based candy little snippets take away warren offered course heart candidacy real solutions respect intelligence accompanying complexity common modern era also electorate becoming progress society insinuating yet future path reopened reap benefits rather failed hope view trailblazer back thoughtful 
even talk bernie people husband best friend included get stomped want woman person followed politics religiously entire conscious life confident blew chance progressive president oh well typo 
they sure warren supporters would bernie dropped really like it higher start primary burned bridges awful online presence let real cardiac health legitimate concern 
it time rally around front runner 
he said give biden nomination received delegates edit clarity would drop time convention 
wonder sanders stubborness work advantage here's scenario refuses release delegates unless biden meets conditions he picks warren vp agrees modify platform far left go good progressive concessions if works might actual get convention supporters feeling like substantial willing vote general election and bonus would run president going i'm certain 
removed rule please read sub rules continue posting 
some number delegates already gone pete warren bloomberg klobuchar it's possible though unlikely sanders biden split remaining way neither gets majority but given statements made whoever end nominee can't see resulting contested convention 
think could still happen if biden sanders split already allocated delegates super tuesday nevada sc nh ia would enough prevent either getting majority fivethirtyeight actually contested convention likely outcome 
any idea tulsi staying race i'm genuinely curious is bernie's backup case health issues 
it's always possible someone's health fails much die drop said hopefully 
the majority around equivalent contested convention https www google com amp fivethirtyeight features election update chances brokered super delegates overwhelmingly vote biden buttigieg klobuchar bloomberg biden whether st round matter much before pete amy dropping saw elizabeth viability many states hope already but chance barring big health problems major scandal either sanders next weeks 
thank response considered first point the second one heard million times idk people would ask she obviously thinks win running 
all three entered stayed race believed they'd best president as right but said since we're fanfic dream could sanders run instead organized warren let's imagine ahh 
you're right it flash especially next years nightmare republican hellscape persist 
it good enough they knew day amy path liz better women rights record platform still sat hands suspect bloomberg funding might stalled things 
making choices election imagine this quote fools sure wise full doubt action it kind cowardice ends nominating boring weak candidates general every time just make damn decision hedging crap pretending opinionless vulcan makes corrupt incompetent rise top 
that foolish stance take one women created equal the fact two female reason holdup light years apart policies makes question leadership 
even worse harry reid loathes biden politics called liz office specifically ask run that endorsement betrayal 
the reid staffers firm warrenites went deadly silent subject never mentioned bernie also several ex vocally expressed displeasure though 
psa came pretty hard bloomberg recall it warren actually kneecap front much bigger audience though 
no it means sexism racism built society large 
honestly uncomfortable some people close said truly shitty things see sanders winning i've stopped talking politics god damn get mean 
true the maga evangelicals chomping bit make holy war election keep murica christian nation bernie jewish 
either they get mad hypothetical scenario bernie win act like support basic human decency unless vote 
warren could unity candidate moderates leftists unfortunately many factors conspired together take path away

warren stealing bernie voters she pulling moderates left 
posted another second choice poll amy pete dropped showed warren supporters supported bernie saying super tuesday ould helped biden twitter followers used hashtags some guy found post said wrong so calmly linked exact referencing he brushed like yes get and made irrelevant comment biden's debate performances suggesting people see together choose guess thinks already seen decided take high road stop debating stranger internet worth energy absolutely exhausting tempted respond please 
wow comments berners need take note see warren able garner support folks would go biden they liked message tone tenor happy warrior buttigieg klobuchar also if continue bury heads sand fail realize elizabeth gateway progressive sanders cannot expand base 
also many warren bernie supporters already switched incivility showing ability build coalition among democrats turned away many others originally planning switching 
this admit less liberal sen warren economics foreign policy admired chutzpah integrity forgave lock step positions believed electability appeal sides democratic voting bloc procedural wonkiness actually shift overton window legislatively think sanders could also appreciated anti establishment nuanced way support idea staff government you can't get anything done without good obama half successful people like biden clinton administration pete amy would hired heavily repeat players served administrations disagreements obama's although thought largely particularly legislative effectiveness ability successfully push back top military brass so i'm keen old faces better happen presidency on hand deep well qualified poc women academics pushed politics marginalized see fully staffed competent full sad american public enthusiastic hilary found even inspiring albeit bit experience truly believe always best job she ways superior plan getting things country needs now gone supporting person left race makes sense that's if wanted vote adopted coalition building shifted harder 
how fucking entitled claim someone stealing your votes 
true case jay inslee supporter donated volunteered warren adopted climate plan i've known bernie sanders three decades since minutes feature burlington mayor dredged recently followed progressive media mostly democracy now ian masters even became acquainted sanders' personality supporters knew unelectable national office if right weaponize john kerry's patriotic service they'd field day years political fringe we can't afford lose suburbs house seats senate supreme court nomination would suicide party so never option though course voted general expect biden could electable building democratic coalition ballot believe unfortunate chose run cycle at point wise step aside 
wow almost like saying whole time correct bernie's twitter stans hysterical seriously though sanders' shortsighted demand plurality winner gets nomination every case he's done much damage campaign past two weeks and narrative shift bad faith agent sent pull away progressive support ever pulling hillary voters anyway the ability reality fit rivals trump supporters yes bernie lurkers less racist sure still susceptible fallacies groupthink 
so saying since october bernie sanders gracefully stepped aside heart attack would landslide 
she best unifying messages i've ever seen always love 
unfortunately though many hardcore nasty bernie supporters opposed prevalent agreeable variety never admit wrong also suspect continue deny saying could done better dropped sooner with everything shakes cruel sounds part hopes sanders regrets joining campaign rest life severely hobbled chances warren thus progressive winning white house 
went strong bernie supporter primary horrified democrat turned many supporters come together vote hillary general embarrassed voted interactions bros online thrilled warren running paid can't stand biden either would rather win point my second choice nobody i'll even though race that's 
more proof warren far better choice progressives 
oof this wounds heart i've saying months going win nomination neither bernie biden warren would end unity candidate contested convention now whichever old white dude pick imo we're dissociate party trump get elected either supporters show actively vote like hillary centrist voters stay home can't socialist see way fix division vs ragequit rather rally 
i'll take things see politics alex 
warren able open eyes moderates afraid bernie way spread message deliver similar much palatable people now dropped willing little bit progressive ideas scared back familiarity candidates like biden moderate 
honestly moderate definitions first pete warren pull pulled left biden kind hate bernie 
ridiculous show poll sanders supporters say she dropped super tuesday and endorsed bernie endorsing right disappointing how fucking entitled people 
i'm libertarian election registered republican she pushed hard corruption intelligent listened people reacted plans took account version voted primary ideologically similar american first felt important us candidate civil liberties common left right voters younger generations tackling many americans trump place on top like biden would remind establishment status quo trying break cycle bernie ideological plus going hay day word socialism wins conditioned specific fearful narrative surrounding indeed sad dropped still know go back corner world work upset i'll suck vote 
again proving bernie ceiling he's already hit he bringing new voters i'm general election going beat trump 
agree warren's policies i'm heavily favoring biden which frankly surprised but essentially comes getting something versus nothing i've serious reservations bernie awhile supported warren instead week convinced lose independents general able turn enough youth voters make also think trump weaponize socialism beat head scare away moderate it he's nominated sure win vs got better shot and biden's supporters much welcoming see taking ideas wins if get worse so that's it's rocket science comments seems like blows supporter's minds 
she also pulled least one cult member bernie insanity watching hillary hulu rn crying 
bernie supporter anecdotally seems true lot moderate friends warren supporters wooed left also supported chose support time it probably close split 
guilty charged never thought progressive started following warren closely 
oh look oratory skill matters 
many real hardcore progressives went bidens camp theory change institutions coalitions branding 
everything would've different sanders dropped heartattack his unwillingness reach across isle finally caught ceiling low 
i'm interested see actually shakes obviously voters always go second choice otherwise would seen warren surge super tuesday top nd klobuchar buttigieg 
she really made forceful arguments definitely affected saw things im still sold single payer someone hc likely never but positions corruption campaign finance yeah ill take please 
i'm moderate warren really use strap fuck marine it'd patriotic duty vote 
hunch unintuitively case it nice evidence though 
of course talking common sense policy sensible regulation plans back versus bernies seemed like empty words understanding actual cost 
i'm pro gun social democrat wants competence intersectionality policy sanders covers first two last biden none 
confused tweet different percentages are regions https twitter com politics polls status 
donated bernie warren strengthened arguments 
it worth noting credibility interval dems higher sub questions only warren supporters polled sample may much sure hope party lets write platform still compelling stat 
agreed also even want hold onto argument vote warren means taken bernie amount votes got st tiny they would made much impact except maybe home state 
yup all recent info proves us right along 
can highlight evidence please reviewed report able find 
exactly thank brothers sisters hard work dedication team bernie day one warren amazing led groundbreaking campaign 
donated bernie warren strengthened arguments 
sample size extremly small question trust morning consultant 
interesting saw moderate compared bernie kinda thought would done better race 
which way better candidate also moderate would voted progressive warren screaming establishment democrats bad guy going unify party beat trump he alienated suburban women senior voters african americans see growing divisive for every one young person gets donate loses several reliable rhetoric misogyny 
same mean honestly idk labels anymore hillary bernie started happy platform convention if definition liberal longer considered can democrats 
same always worried progressive movement would everything accomplished but warren gave amazing detailed plans things she brilliant also pragmatic made great president 
that word exhausting they internet equivalent guy follow street home rambling way refuse leave agree stop it's fanatical nature zealots make nervous 
sanders supporter agree sorry us get 
yeah comments crazy but policies you get lose trump going vote heart warren i'm heavily leaning towards voting head instead think bernie win and i'd rather take movement policy perhaps even influenced vs backsliding 
think problem always come back matter dumb sounds fact bernie democrat pretty clearly grievances party know deal democrats wanted warren go feel like really part ultimately needs acknowledge order still win he make friends people leading lot us pay attention leaders endorsements 
this makes lot sense many warren's bernie nd choice left back fall numbers dropped went that means warren supporters going include less choice add far harder moderate many still team previously would hesitant go 
some us progressives critical behavior years many showing try get people support bernie denied downplayed often happens step getting warren supporters admitting problem making actual strides fix for i've seen much denial deflection festering if loses chapotraphouse tell vote third party so going stake 
my friends fall warrentobiden new york waiting the negativity aggression bernie camp much 
second group voted yet planning voting warren even going win dropped torn like bernie worry health think effective president even policies still needs able get passed joe moderate taste lot respect 
hoping sanders drops vote conscience late month 
yes incivility mirrored trump cultism along fsb behind sanders ultimately caused switch vote bernie warren 
someone said look like carrot twitter honestly night went home registered republican years true blue democratic this disrespect stop words maybe action 
another consideration we love liz plans we're pragmatists so we're likely back candidate think beat trump 
edit accidentally went one parent high 
agreed everything got last paragraph even biden plan goal leads significant improvements 
this well said and loved jay inslee cannot think voter would liked progressives moderates he fabulous unity candidate warren 
my favorite given day bernie supporters shouting warren sell really progressive centrist establishment corporate shill abandoned principles snake boot next drops start saying ideas basically minor differences vote which lol 
the plurality winner absolutely always win also think let group twitter users decide generalized opinion large voters 
so many exit polls love warren we've got stop bernie biden voted one just imagine everyone actually who they wanted as president we'd candidate least mostly well liked progressives moderates 
would loved septuagenarian white dudes already lost primary sat one or we're gonna vote former loser man least bring back john kerry 
bingo it's message messenger he actually preventing progressive ideas going mainstream zeal demonize 
feel like forgetting opposition hammered plan pushed narrative feasible before steadily approaching biden polls 
if cater sanders platform anti corruption fairness financial system even tax billionaires instead middle class holding social media tycoons account could appealed trump voters well moderates progressives like anchor us back finding common ground ordinary workers 
his staff surrogates including congresspeople press secretary figured math yet seeing blamed st showing liz dropping just blame upcoming march losses endorse even though race already convention trump wins election 
also suspect continue deny saying could done better dropped sooner told people super tuesday left warrens supporter probably split biden bernie nd choice meaning little impact bernie's performance 
given set ways incapable change see sanders ever regrets anything and circle people basically sycophantic trump supporters 
on evidence base claim 'many supporters come together vote hillary general' in three surveys trump sanders crossover rates estimated this seems line general trends example two mccain respectively more indepth analysis sources found washington post article https www washingtonpost com news monkey cage wp enough bernie sanders trump cost clinton election course excuse contextualize something unfortunately clearly norm full disclosure voted acknowledge biases however like think i'm rational swayed facts warren lot staunch progressive would believed better shot winning nomination 
imagine neither bernie biden ran cycle we would choosing crop much better candidates none polarizing other bloomberg nonentity warren got claws 
find dismissive support progressive policies think warren actually make progress bernie can't with president doubt we'd much more importantly there's way beat trump getting office utmost importance pragmatic voter hence candidate appealed 
they've found scapegoat going beat death 
that poll bloomberg dropped i'm correct 
no would stop trying make nders warren happen it shit 
if endorses sanders win majority supers choose someone else party destroyed election biden needs clear nominee point non ideal 
warren liked candidate field points behind biden 
it belief biden actually one riskier options think currently popular ever essentially go attack ads start he uninspiring going critical bringing numbers polls necessary beat trump many candidates warren example increase popularity get closer people learn platform 
how biden ahead anyone he touch 
she would absolutely destroy trump debate thinks quickly feet fazed moronic insults imo kill witty comebacks one liners that lady sharp tack 
the averages across multiple polls https www realclearpolitics com epolls president us democratic presidential nomination html much grim they put biden percentage points ahead nearest competition 
i'm glad well liked liking someone mean they're gonna vote like bunch candidates one 
do polls really matter early see candidates real potential my support fully behind warren stage going bust voter come next november the debates week affect none enough time make impression everyone looking sound bite like harris made agains biden last 
resistbot hour ago warren nearly half votes sanders harris buttigieg yang biden o'rourke williamson booker castro not sure anything else using bot thank rep finally backing impeachment asked wanted take poll 
like discussion happening thread said wish real anti poll movement country this obsession polling largely distraction part ruining substantive political discourse 
i've telling clowns reddit extremely likable awhile glad vindicated 
biden conservative likely go softer big businesses amongst group including warren sanders it shouldnt surprise major media outlets constantly pushing frontrunner dem's gonna take office want biden let's make possibility go liz 
this one poll sample size the result may surprising hardly settled fact stay vigilant 
not sure accurate poll it follow link says oversamples women color but nice know well demographic 
warren bernie there candidates president 
serious question gonna keep trump saying pocahontas feel like going hard overcome 
does bother anyone else pictures poses supporters called selfies not take away efforts connect people misuse term makes cringe 
hope wins she tax wealthy work saving climate cancelling student debt huge boost also healthcare 
history poor judgement gaffes relative conservatism help 
honestly worry biden think worth paying mind if anything he's useful warren his place frontrunner soclib primary pretty tenuous continue harris buttigieg o'rourke et al biting heels hopes getting obamastalgia vote and longer better she beat comes two predominant she'll benefit field narrows as risk losing average an unenthused left problem he'll hillary center sexism but order lowest likely yield greatest numbers 
think biden one serious contenders risk winning the man walking gaffe 
he lost nothing fundamentally change comment billionaire financiers that top constant string bad choices utter inability show even slightest bit remorse idea written 
biden clinton he corporate choice wrong america 
brand recognition don't underestimate literally decades public service vp first black president he known across world warren comparison fairly unknown senator office long relatively speaking put way local burger joint far better mcdonalds everyone knows golden arches fighting uphill battle votes she amazingly helps sincere people actually hear find agree pretty much everything says i'm worried there's plenty time momentum increases appearances bring debate 
insane name recognition he white man straight scare rich powerful 
canvassing warren nh hear people want someone beat trump fair unfair polling perception person likely able biden it becomes self fulfilling prophecy unfortunately polls media say electable believe support path victory runs early states given positives shows iowa win suddenly become democratic primary voters once arguments policies likability 
really like biden he seems pretty good guy always tries thinks right trying kind everyone legitimately acts grandfather my would make awful president if biggest hobbies passion include butterscotch ice cream making applesauce leave nuclear codes someone else need govern nation lead help figure canning methods fairly likeable probably material though 
fwiw party evenly split people identify liberal moderate conservative biden basically side also recent poll democrats asked prefer candidate bold new agenda provide steady reliable leadership chose support comes older nonwhite voters he pretty touch imo his vision maybe think just younger https www foxnews com politics fox news while fox news generally awful polls fine rated highly 
say seems touching things time 
seriously wonder people making comments like voting age reached make absolutely zero sense given sort thought fact america elected trump not everyone acts exactly reddit in fact minority often shows most stable jobs income they want massive changes create threats life style if vote guy marginally better also changing much people comfort sameness also let honest hates women hillary would man she high standards warren harris facing 
actually read article second place first choice behind joe biden who's sorry heading clear 
disagree pretty strongly actually obama generatiom levels charisma given flake inexperienced little lacking policy hillary massive wonk historically disliked warren well liked extremely important comes low information voters wisconsin florida michigan pennsylvania going vote gut briefs if based resume would enjoying easy run nd term right 
good point still seems like positive data 
i'm glad well liked liking someone mean they're gonna vote while true look flip side lead being means people listen platform liking make views different policies donating likability plays big factor politics whether think makes viable candidate republicans always run would want beer someone could qualifications funding etc pretentious dickhead like 
what really tells us resistbot mostly used white educated politically engaged liberals warren pretty much dominates voting bloc your username hilarious btw 
yes in state progressive candidate governor lost primary moderate week saw lot people switching votes thought likely beat heavily disliked third dem it based inaccurate polling became clear counted never chance winning anyway voted conscience 
it's hard say media pushing joe biden he's leading polls do really think they'd cover progressive if bernie would probably great ratings cnn eat 
at end page says weights group proper proportions they wanted better margins error targeted groups 
warren bernie there candidates president don't ridiculous even moderate democrat like biden would infinitely better trump 
every single candidate something trump say relatively speaking people remember whole pocahontas thing 
nothing don't respond even blink pocahontas name really used smear someone low information voter pa think sounds like funny nickname pleasant connotations disney movie it slur called one princesses honestly that's best controversy trump drum warren's already debate 
are selfies what's proper use term there's real winning one you call snide people say cringe hello fellow kids photos wow stiff robot wants beer right not saying i'd rather legit asking focus group word selfie cringy 
while generally agree selfie picture take think term changed regardless actually takes 
find endearing lmao it's also probably purposeful branding 'selfie' sounds warm welcoming 'picture' 
his things fundamentally change comments want someone stays climate seriously 
harris greater risk biden losing she motivate left way either bernie warren center anymore hillary done it's also clear mobilizes black voters would generally speaking think biggest front runners terms trump 
still pretty new actively involved politics thing so trying get bearings what think warren pete ticket it feels bit like might able pull together midwest personally love way phrases comments worldview implied but lot good reasons president wonder would well vp any thoughts 
to clear think candidates lose popular vote clear majority whoever runs trump even propaganda russian interference voter registration purges lost ballot boxes but do struggle win all change ton votes specific make beating serious challenge it doable not bag 
but comes still better trump 
ehh think kamala clinton biden worse 
he answer rich powerful question what safer choice hillary clinton 
he good read white religion 
the effect propels biden might downfall downward trends also self fulfilling since poll numbers dropping hurt image electable instigate drops 
thanks canvassing here iowa i'm seeing lot early support warren regarding polling electability agree much written i'd tell people static social fact constructing part make someone unelectable give way would premature rather going mat 
just inform biden history racism https medium com westonpagano guide democratic candidates vote among many issues he's least bit innocent 
literally told mom couple weeks ago like grandpa ran potus 
fwiw party evenly split people identify liberal moderate conservative out curiosity basing assertion anything particular and regardless misses major consideration far vote democrats country when considering message engage inspire established dems doubt rhetoric going work engaged past 
most people stable jobs income they want massive changes create threats life style if vote guy make marginally better also changing much people like comfort sameness there's lot unpack first job mean good high underemployment huge problem costs things childcare rising faster wages one survey https www urban org sites default files publication material hardship among nonelderly adults families pdf example found despite relatively low average unemployment rate many reported financial hardships year food security housing stability utility payments healthcare many work full time struggling anything comfortable and beyond plenty may pocket books children's futures communities values see difference impacts conservative democrats republicans spent years organizing blue state nearly went trump republicans showed farmers wage workers students drowning debt point voting someone big think severely underestimating thirst change country unfortunately general election candidate 
the average american lives paycheck little invested retirement think financially stable 
that's much outlier poll the average polls biden warren behind bernie https www realclearpolitics com epolls president us democratic presidential nomination html like outlets report one misleading reality situation actually and think that's healthy good anyone doubt well liked awesome but mean anywhere close if add warren's support get statical tie fear reporting encourages people stop trying hard candidate nominated 
agree lot comparisons warren hillary based assumptions smart strong women likability explicit sexism despite fact different person much charismatic better policy likability helpful electability argument 
low information voters wisconsin florida michigan pennsylvania going vote gut can confirm pennsyltucky amish roam there's many people best interests the problem they're fox news work religiously affiliated credit union overheard two guys complaining mueller's report saying found absolutely nothing needs shit get pot they know anything really flynn manafort etc guilty pleas that paid civil forfeitures got points guess makes standard scale much wrong 
it keep mind elizabeth warren subreddit going polls show best results you hear good good news look top candidate consistently risen month biden slipped sanders harris spiked debate fell back bit far slowly kept rising at rate still long way catching possible 
bingo that warren top far biden yang lmao 
exactly we also know polling easily manipulated candidates michael cohen trump's personal laywer fixer hiring firms rig major polls https thehill com homenews news cohen hired firm try online trump paid part bill it's easy talk data especially positive think ignoring larger problems affects political discourse creates self perpetuating narratives swing votes get people vote interests 
ehh dont agree think many people least remember brought if warren able cannibalize bernie bros serious shot it depends fans get equally excited anyways interesting race sure best luck 
selfie understand photo taken someone hence term but clearly must minority finding odd use i'll let 
she cannibalizing status quote joe pretty sure choice warren trump bernie supporters would chose most done executive order easily undone fixed terms stopping future bad presidents things 
think pete great guy afaik running state office would win know much value adds ticket my bigger issue vp exists case something happens potus i'm sure enough experience 
pete much baggage polarizing there's large number democrats really like plan remove blight income inequality south bend evasion topics reasons abysmal relations african american community key warren also frankly seems kind guy play well second place this insult far actually ticket would draw attention vp pick imagine someone castro could get nod younger minority strong ideals noisy not milquetoast candidate who's unobjectionable happy work rather side 
clinton liked look voting record policy position i'd say significantly progressive biden pragmatic could accomplished time perhaps little much inspiring 
this insane i'm huge warren fan want win check posting history wish confirm biden clearly much stronger candidate clinton he charismatic authentically blue collar chemistry popular obama married someone highly questionable sexual 
you'd think safer tm choice would someone like harris buttigieg warren faults whole dna thing far left centrist but problems they're center reasonable likable personalities biden much he's crass dismissive experience yeah gets presidential election however quite personal background interesting story though her history professor champion something believes got congress fought odds see liked many she definitely captures attention 
their slightly unsafe choice still extremely safe terms economic policy buttigieg 
he also really slow combating trump ukraine that cbs poll said people satisfied warren smears biden 
lol think biden honest obama said yet sure 
there gallup poll recently found something like described liberal moderate conservative it notable first time majority said still even split that assumes people vote prefer less candidates believe polls shown typically case people lean democratic hillary big reason often cited defeat decline minority turnout but lot miss voters color tend members party think nyt article various my opinion going left energize base wishful thinking going far could alienate determining factor candidate campaigning abilities rather policies little right 
while agree disprove point this country elected bush twice much better alternatives we also trump there even concern could beat warren it sad 
on contrary think indicator things look good polls largely worthless people asked like instead they'd supposedly vote get valid response finding looking american politics popularity contest core we chance elect honor student bully we'll 
think encourages supporters see good polls know support meaningful impact true may outlier mean can't take little comfort 
grew bradford county know exactly people talking my uncle going socialist dems nephew actually piped liked one oklahoma kind acts like principle warren lucky stay turbulence far weirdly enough fox news seems kept much 
yup and there's quite bit international precedent banning polling election surveys amount time day completely outrageous consider although imagine media companies would less thrilled proposal 
every candidate something remember true relevant context donald trump liar core fans believe lies john hickenlooper partially correct they'll call us socialists embrace socialist policies what failed note everyone real socialism even close level countries like venezuela they're fear mongering do really think get debate stage moral quandary making person whether dragging pocahontas calling bernie sanders regardless who's fight fists teeth claws the issue comment comparing imaginary can't created that exist mother teresa could democratic he'll figure tell base eat absolutely zero way around 
i'm really hoping warren castro ticket 
that sounds like really good reasoning i'll pay closer attention tomorrows debates already moved back side list attacking democrats with many people close enough time give proper research every single one falling behind arbitrary stem bad day so castro booker ones keep eye potential vp pick though sure lots talent presidential debate stage thanks chat 
good vp pick would someone clear connections midwest states trump castro regardless nominee expect people talk sherrod brown bob casey tammy baldwin 
for depends things shape if final two warren biden yes one younger vps would preferrable much want year run beto probably first choice buttigieg castro o'rourke although i'd love see pete debate pence but mainly think help florida liability feel like name might poison cuban community especially leftward candidacy that'd require actually getting campaign comes harris party unity ticket 
buttigieg polarizing instead go someone wants decriminalize illegal border crossings whether support policy ridiculous believe inflammatory lot voters including swing 
if ever wondered elizabeth warren could knock trump oblivion tonight answer absolutely annihilated bloomberg he may never walk tried tell ewarren whoop ass been screaming she destroy

if vote top candidates my yang sanders warren 
i'm sure whether trump situation bloomberg someone wants votes democratic voters warren attacks battling mainly want office with must persuade swing states could potentialy vote alienate 
mean saying warren lose wins nomination bc billionaires make bloomberg trump as awful seen somehow deflect attack 
she channeled every accomplished woman dismissed mediocre man 
bloomberg probably thinks astros apologize anything 
thanks from past debate encounters think likes yang would open incorporating ideas platform 
think warren well tonight come mega thread join us conversation https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments discussion thread ninth democratic primary debate fi uv context 
fellow yang ganger aligned warren ideologically lot things really appreciate thoroughly explains idea reasons behind bust people stop reading think make effective majority leader senate progressive president

necessarily agree liz knocked bloomberg but sharpen sword slice jugular remember dude money like god also believes one taken lightly most voters watch debates especially since dems wait forever get onto good ones hanged mussolini whether want metaphorical however push higher ups nbc continue ads news media works business needs grow every quarter management keep jobs this referendum power working let's complacent we must phonebank and raise money work to end mr racist sexist republican bloomberg don't let posts make 
hopefully amy who relegated sidelines belongs warren moves back front always belonged same wall street pete

removed civility let's use one group people negative comparison another 
they're i'd actually proud vote i'll dem anyways except bloomberg i'm staying home 
this democrats lost don't reflexively give groups peoples' votes election 
my point different ball game debating bloomberg prove disprove ability 
not hot take cheaters make anything fun 
meant people reject anything negative warren originally phrased crazy supporters thought would met hostility 
waiting go funding scott brown realized would tactical mistake no reason make anyone think criticism personal she focused massive vulnerabilities general election hit every mark

i'm honestly surprised even country artists come support guy usually nashville loves republicans 
media hypocrisy elizabeth warren's employment history 
billion million bloomberg's total wealth spent ad buys if dollars bank account house stock buy dollar latte starbucks spend larger percentage bloomberg by order magnitude fact and yet media narrative my god warren made years legal expert 
mean real in years could say made million teacher it sounds like lot really 
the spin mainstream media sickening it's exact corruption calls every public appearance keep fighting friends 
the media flaw hillary trump cares things candidate pretends sort standards 
to honest think much warren paid important corporate lawyer looks like underpaid did take long periods time look kids jobs over years would expected least double triple amount 
man remember couple months ago narrative the media giving warren much positive coverage reporters demographic what happened 
human beings real issue understanding enormous difference million billion trillion side note one dollar second become millionaire days billionaire years god forbid trillionaire 
pete buttigieg lis smith smear campaign continues https twitter com status 
like dont know rich cancer planet 
boy write make splash day called political operatives' strategy trying disrupt warren mainly posing sanders supporters http np reddit com redditsecurity comments nml suspected campaign russia vofle never controversial comment users spammed continued stalking subreddits days this spite one higher gilded well know slightly unrelated still it's sort indicative much threat centrists right wing operatives perceive great sign book after saw wall street said 
here's happened warren started polling lead that means going see negative pieces come which fine including pushed opponents especially if avoid attacking entire primary process leave ammunition attacks table gop use general look bernie think secretary state right american people sick tired hearing damn emails oct fast forward almost exactly one year later still talking contributing costing election issue hurts want open avoided even attack 'unfair' 
the billionaire owned media going kind fair accurate honest coverage candidates wish hold billionaires accountable many crimes this expected 
are media treating bloomberg serious contender if ignoring makes sense 
the ironic thing someone warren's educationnbackground supposed make million lifetime so warren actually earned less could 
i'm going contrarian it's media hypocrisy they're reporting information came new therefore getting highlighted besides coverage bloomberg generally accompanied fact he's self financing campaign possible extremely wealthy 
if dollars bank account house stock buy dollar latte starbucks spend larger percentage total wealth bloomberg feel attacked 
million tyvm she clearly elitist billionaire monster 
true ya'll realize like billion dollars cold hard cash its spread net assets i'd waager majority wealthy stock market highly volatile 
she took short term law jobs primarily worked professor teaching 
the people media bloomberg demographic happened 
she even eats food drinks water nice things 
people keep posting like revelation maybe understanding number difficult 
tired pete at times like things makes extremely bad disingenuous comments time he sounds republican regard whole truth parts convenient moment 
the comments seem critical tweet though promising 
is deleted link seem work 
agreed this news senator warren brand it's attempting label charge hypocrisy i'm sure buy argument but think crazy comparison kind absurd 
this true gladly take highly volatile net worth stable negative 
mean sure but hard use 
again one saying scrooge mcduck pile money we're pointing scale vast difference economic resources controlled 
by short term law jobs mean work referred tweet something else not knowing much makes difficult know underpaid understand i've done similar lawyer engineer 
that sounds lot racist probably intended think happened realized wealth tax popular enough implemented regardless wins provided trump given likelihood trying make anything associated toxic candidates touch 
understanding number issue able visualize massive difference million billion for people anything huge sum realizing much hard 
i'm tired much comms director tenuous relationship truth 
the op backslash url reason it works remove https twitter com lis smith status 
most articles i've seen frame pretty reasonably they state facts liz corporate clients made million do see much coverage around outside small splash first released data not really honestly think case journalists due diligence media hit job 
the reason made sort headlines i'd argue largely minor ones there's pretty public back forth exchange buttigieg warren transparency demanded release list clients mckinsey corporate worked lawyer that what's high attention fact million three decades once came news reported reporting i've seen quite fairly we've moved it small splash much like canadian grocery chain client getting relatively little fanfare today it's two candidates prominent neither scenario released information prime time blown proportion while challenging media bias misbehavior important also think cry wolf every look things context objectivity 
the post actually already story attacking months ago said sometimes made hr lawyers promptly pointed probably less worth https www thecut com elizabeth warren legal fees lawyer reactions html around normal relatively important partners 
it difficult concept wealthy women people media absolutely interest promoting candidate make considerably less wealthy blumberg demographic see concerned referring jews bloomberg if hear say control think one racist 
he could tell cut replace as warren says personnel policy 
know can't talk candidates lis smith good human 
except they've played story https www thecut com elizabeth warren legal fees lawyer reactions html hourly wage rather total lifetime earnings 
okay that's line expecting when people saying year seemed bit odd warren push hr vs highlight gender disparity the million vague 
that said probably intended likely meant wealthy people regardless given historical trope cognizant phrase things 
not anyone needs shed tears partners top end firms there's pretty significant gender pay gap https biglawbusiness com female law face percent survey finds 
when talking literally people control media phrase do want say necessarily jewish please tell think specific example 
as lis smith candidate maybe long focused issues rather personal attacks 
and pay gap the staff partner track hell lot harder female attorneys 
you could said wealthy people fellow ers etc 
as lis smith candidate maybe long focused issues rather personal attacks the comparisons kac based gender 
see problem literally talking people media corporations influence gets reported that wealthy it would substantially change meaning write 
then could refer ownership media companies by referring demographic pushing racist meme unintentionally 
warren calls legalizing marijuana repealing crime bill ending cash bail banning private prisons 
know crime bill looked https en wikipedia org wiki violent crime control law enforcement act seems throwing shade biden attacking overall good 
there goes there she goes standing ovation 
really like see warren president dems controlling full congress 
idea something like cash bonds existed point pretty ask 
every candidate views warren throws that's choice president 
but ok president would anybody able without congress 
at least removing marijuana schedule drug would really help colorado states already legal right businesses prohibited using bank that's federally insured cash business that makes ripe corruption violence 
but she was republican go liz 
it mandatory minimum bill right 
violent crime control law enforcement act the pub congress dealing crime law enforcement became it largest bill history united states consisted pages provided new police officers billion funding prisons prevention programs designed significant input experienced sponsored representative jack brooks texas originally written senator joe biden delaware passed signed president bill clinton following california street shooting waco siege high profile instances violent expanded federal several ways pm https www reddit com message compose kittens space exclude wikitextbot excludeme subject subreddit np elizabethwarren banned faq information wiki index source github kittenswolf downvote remove 
im glad throwing shade biden while one wants mudslinging feel like warren bernie hesitant call real true flaws biden's record it's time kid gloves come trump hold back

most probably done executive action may enough otherwise congress would need pass laws 
merely appointing fda head would de schedule marijuana enormous leap forward towards legalization it protect medical patients nationwide fired due positive test 
precedent says could executive order needed due blatant abuse trump bush even obama then force legislation action would much tougher pass new laws items overreach way good little fdr 
sanders voted yes bill http clerk house gov evs roll xml complicated position 
this one call anything bernie already called

anyone else link sanders promising repeal superpredator bill this guy bailing calling awful cut congresspeople say every compromise strike never again sincerely would like proven wrong bite unless mothball links 
yes you certainly engaging good faith 
apparently warren never allowed fun again 
that person said starting realize scott brown made good points warren refuses bow lord savior 
if bernie loses pull moderates non ideological voters cause you know like warren could 
why warren responsibility make bernie failure expand base this worry idea general election seems like hit wall support know appeal people already 
the frustrating thing lot senator sanders supporters still mode running campaign win primarily focused bringing issues national discussion if plan winning purity righteous indignation even taking democratic party center left factions unexpectedly well pivot moment came late completely redefine run now he's he needs coalitions voters supported primary candidates like mayor buttigeig warren apparently desperately this mean compromise vision policies stemming need stop treating people they're traitors want eat poor biden seeing hard working progressive woman leader essentially created consumer financial protection bureau sheer force who's voted numerous times help students including boost school funding tackle student loans sponsored bills equal employment major worker protections fought regulation financial institutions votes sanders time called snake neoconservative really then seeing clutch pearls get offended suggested misogyny might played role warren's performance i'm going vote spite group think bullying nomination he's lose change tune quickly getting closer securing every day and i'd willing bet lunch blue matter enough progressives 
the double standard astounding if runs bernie detriment drops takes time race also what fuck apparently popular win also point think liz endorse either candidate 
if she was true progessive she would endorse bernie she's snake she owe anything endorsing bernie terrible move politically yeah political decision washington like giant middle school if want make big structural change can't give democratic establishment finger every day expect help goals given what gotten not much also someone fake progressive endorsing also election swaying endorsement street cred 
lmao bernie begging endorsement time surrogates supporters trashing going snl why would want part movement 
there video posted bernie sub elizabeth warren speaking saying really nice things senate all comments trashing campaign know expect unite progressive movement keep shooting legs 
good thing warren dropped worried bernie's supporters able find another woman blame campaign failing 
not people still allowed fun insane argument point playing sax arsenio hall may critical bill clinton's road white house look think stupid likeability shit matters politics it's horrifying many americans vote whoever want beer which one reason nation deserves dethroned world leader again see double standard warren if man there'd lot fewer issues snl appearance 
like even twitter cut post say oh god fucking please stop 
isn't raising awareness going snl doesn't help movement can please stop voting controversy stay focused goal unification collaboration 
and surely original tweeter contributed legislatively progressive cause speak authority pfft liz done could fathom protip snake emojis count policy 
watching hillary doc last night hulu think whether like really highlights tough woman succeed well liked politics one quote got think universally loved let try emulate anyone this back feminist icon kept job lawyer rallied healthcare spoke th un women convention and hated it hard anything everything scrutinized high bar 
did see replies aoc tweet calling flip switch vid legendary so many berners going disappointing 
funny job get nomination maybe make sure someone gets give qualified candidate instead nah better people vote sanders 
no one demanding andrew yang make endorsement just saying 
it's never bernie's fault the always due conspiracy someone else maybe bernie supporters would man actually constructive productive people receptive message but 
bernie fucked period his downfall unwillingness discipline campaign it's like parent allows child whatever kid wants refuses accept responsibility starts hurting people don't surprised refuse talk becomes biggest bully around block 
it never even occurs people appearing snl lends credibility platform 
this kind criticism reminds sports fans hate player team posting picture something fun offseason the comments always gym subtext allowed life ever even athletes are lot took downtime 
woman's purpose show unflinching loyalty man ya know even threw bus nothing surrogates supporters ripped shreds like starving dogs you reap sow 
lmao bernie job get nomination it elizabeth but anyway sure thinks right best approach try accomplish agenda 
bernie literally squandered post iowa nh nevada momentum acting like front runner unforced errors praising castro skipping selma go rally la doubling divisive vs establishment rhetoric no attempts unify anything besides underdog fighting uphill battle also making stronger inroads black community obviously trust too much focus rallies hear applause base enough expanding building coalitions unity it nomination lose 
he's using tactics see happened 
the thing warren allowed say endorses bernie sanders second coming christ anything else says every breath exhales does not include endorsement proof neo lib actually conservative republican trumpeter along how dare ugh ridiculous so 
unfollow ashley tweet it like seriously she working every day rest election get 
hot take kind dialog twitter driving making us dumber less able real conversation 
good lord people need calm appearance snl funny spending campaigning dropped plus take little bit time decompress done deciding next move 
that pure twitter stupidity hate trend social media news source get paper 
getting feeling warren dems need break away bernie progressives build coalition cooler heads rhetoric openness working folks persuaded policy ideas yet stanning requirement progressive 
bernard stans treating likeliest allies warren pete kamala even worse biggest called enemies 
i've seen lot twitter either can't acknowledge even endorsement numbers she put top brought us board happen supporters gone biden they're lashing warren see another campaigns crashing refuse blame bernie mistakes he's made campaign when drops they'll completely doubt enough venom lately know coming 
sanders supporters acting like makes glad decided go biden edit personally pmed supporter post he called clown gay let say understand voting records change people grow grew continues person also pming insult want vote actively dislike 
this person trying tell warren bare minimum progressive causes wild 
some bernie's supporters pure toxic the people berated beloved senator still asshats tweeting stuff like asking support liz choose biden put nail 
regret shifting support warren biden whatsoever 
how stop making responsibility done she responsible sure wins 
they're already trying force narrative bernie loses primary warren support 
people mad know warren better dancer debater leader would made president reasons endorsed bernie 
that take coming fucking bernie supporter makes want rip eyes 
if bernie loses want viscous back biting supporters good long talk person im mirror could done differently expand coalition 
if withholding bernie endorsement means gets treasury biden worth 
only real leftists cry warren snl 
holy cow people goddamn dumb this made irrationally angry or maybe rationally unsure 
if way slap someone face twitter saying something dumb awful 
took look ashley ray's timeline she seems like someone one goal stir shit get people angry hot takes 
strong coalition building shitting one candidate group supporters easy get 
you know things rough bernie fans attacking aoc liking warren dance 
see bernie camp working hard gain liz votes 
tulsi gabbard splitting progressive vote 
making real hard vote biden spite bernie bust folks even though many bite bullet hillary i'm willing tomorrow fall but man make 
she definitely allowed fun do think endorse 
this problem extreme populism demagoguery you may like positions followers often treat things life death 
i've seen people losing minds can't take 
please stop letting random internet posts divide us those support ideas warren sanders so much common happily voted november biden win definitely closer ever we team 
love stuff like lands timeline shows accounts mute ignore got lot far 
the nerve https mashable com video bernie sanders impersonator james adomian interview 
ugh screw people like ashley ray watched snl skit warren funny witty willing laugh made sad thinking could still support endorses another candidate pray run since biden sanders likely one term presidents 
they never saw us allies 
and that know going anger someone saying hope endorse anyone it responsibility get one men elected superior candidate every way 
if bernie loses supporters assholes rest teach fucking manners want progressive candidate make blood boil 
when bernie loses virtually inevitable thanks way handled first half race represent biggest missed opportunity progressives generation and base nobody blame buddy mine friend say recently entitled votes he used word none coming poach support entitled anything get 
moderates pulled policy if true hillary would plowed trump swing states 
well quite like warren could unfortunately want president able get large enough coalition together 
you blame anyone well others lane felt like one points talking exit male supporter bernie expect endorse also think supporters decide voted support candidate probably biden wins nomination thinking progressives must band together progressive works for senator warren capital represents valuable base defeat trump still minority primaries if endorses sanders people say caved far left goes went center in fact going person look plan give ideas weight administration she surrendering taking victory movement repositioning needs earn voters moving done smart knows right thing 
too bad warren pull minorities 
he good policies he's really shit selling candidate moderate democratic base 
agree everything saying maddow's interview last week really highlighted she asking neutral legitimate questions going clyburns endorsement non white voters sanders responses telling encouraging he's even attempting unite moderates 
in short reap sow they wanted treat every candidate like enemy made enemies 
what's weird active sanders supporter primary i've met local supporters pretty wide bernie country wa well communicated heavily many online tiny fraction people literally zero real life encountered even yutes college two dozens mean actually talk voice video chat verifiable humans say toxic type those trump otherwise kind opposite way go propensity make mistakes reddit accounts relatively new recently worst seen really hardcore twitter facebook seem almost hateful gross approached discussion refuse communication besides text saw shape things change overnight jumped sub suddenly broader friendly barely allowed mod activity serious downvotes hostile everywhere happen oddly buttigieg points the mods much contend top cleaning lot happened similarly rubbed wrong biden neoliberal subs my experience makes lean towards possibility large majority social media genuine maybe american know true reports indicate widespread stuff nature though means can't point finger anyone particular accuse russia so i'm sure leaves convince others genuinely nasty appear course loss least believing various candidates horrible though major warren's balanced mods shit nice folk would happily voted nominee 
to fair warren definitely given democratic establishment middle finger time two deserved 
this true there's point tossing away political capital going achieve anything warren understands something bernie play ball people you can't walk around screaming democrats evil suddenly surprised treat like bad guy 
yea giving democratic party middle finger everyday work seen bernie crowds boo democrats trump he fights establishment like dems evil says need save medicare social security which party think passed laws it embraced warren consumer financial protection bureau maybe swarm supporters busy calling snake base might shifted smart remember trainee volunteers tell voters elitist educated folks how strategy go 
you're true progressive everyone washington hates nevermind need people actually affect policy change dislike why cant warren bernie 
necessarily think endorsing sanders bad move politically lot sway party least since dropped would genuine boost campaign help assure people still someone pragmatic administration helping make decisions that said there's also case biden exchange cabinet post benefit progressive cause likely ends winning if option even table anyway 
because people are gonna die without medical care sorry people already going faith sanders administration getting talking points passed 
trump went snl he horrible definitely gave likability points and jimmy fellon touching hair late night 
wish republicans would realize trump drink alcohol he even sit beer liked 
many warren supporters loyal progressivism lot us liked she qualified best approach describe moderate convinced go little left would otherwise now obvious get behind 
isn't raising awareness going snl how help advance progressive policies if joe biden gets nomination progressives get endorsing sanders takes second tweet can please stop voting controversy stay focused goal unification collaboration agree the time unite cause that means stopping 
the number people recall work health care astounding 
yeah they're switching ilhan https imgur com png 
their entire attitude since beginning sidekick cheerleader anything less betrayal progressivism incarnate she get show daylight outshine she's fine long knows place 
warren surging bernie dropping beginning heart attack he could easily seen momentum shifting drop throw support would completely changed dynamics race gotten quite amy pete supporters board challenge biden instead aoc endorse steal votes smear dogs troll alienating entire democratic party process wonders despicable liked election prepared vote but man true colors really revealed 
happy cake day and love analogy papa bernie needs get house order 
bernie skipped selma jesus christ 
dwayne the rock johnson tweets elizabeth warren baller 
surprise sure welcome one last i'd heard dwayne johnson republican but y'kno mild ones like schwarzenegger socially liberal i'm rich prefer pay less taxes 
good fire lately pretty amazing movies need politically engaged support warren want enact policies celebrities key bringing unengaged young really hoping taylor swift comes hard 
this obviously reaction bit the tonight late show kept saying favorite actor ballers 
last night brewery overheard someone end bar asking friends seen warren video gay marriage fire response gave they pulled watched phone the others laughed said that great like think three people converted supporters 
that's really interesting thought conservative similar arnie cause beefcakes 
wow those twitter comments though why magats fear celebrity endorsements elected fake game show host 
we hearing buzz liz vp castro gillum bets the rock 
yeah think it doesnt matter what you think 
dave bautista supports sanders this work next wrestlemania 
love enthusiastic the rock liz it great 
baller shot caller twenty inch blades impala 
he said year two ago considering run president earliest although used registered republican independent 
trump making everyone rethink republican 
conservatives the hollywood elite need keep mouths shut politics also conservatives elect actor reality tv show host 
think tweeted saw said ballers just one question segment colbert week 
if taylor swift comes warren spontaneously combust 
and fact continually makes baller moves campaign trail mic drop moments like marry one woman find night flattening opponents left right debate stage memorably john delaney if label fits wear 
late show https youtu hoifsmhwpoq 
totally picture what happy image 
actually conservative we exactly home either democratic republican parties anymore but republicans enact policy's without pay for's democrats always come ready idea pay policies so reality better fiscally the way would feel party equal rights minorities which dying belief 
anyway arnie conservative lite when things like social issues election security come play he's outspoken liberal 
he white tends correlate one political views 
it one way streets they give two craps extramarital affairs criminal behavior lying oath celebrity endorsements care winning power control massage fragile egos trump apotheosis anything works keep team get rah rah ree kick em knee rass similar sports fans cheer opposing player gravely injured deplorable hillary right doubled comment first place 
yeah comments cancer written form 
remember last election hulk hogan said wanted trump vp pick that would merica thing happen history 
die hard warren fan liz picks the rock vp everything know lie she would get vote trump zero financial support going volunteer anymore confident 
do smell the rock cookin 
more like support progressive candidate highest chance actually passing legislation 
reality tv like use quotes single thing real 
also conservatives here's clint eastwood dementia edition ramble chair rnc barrack sucks please clap 
not mention die excitement find celebrity republican 
also kanye really insightful things say 
that's ok support support even casual 
she definitely coming democratic nominee mentioned stayed quite worried would harm good trump now going outspoken the question comes warren primary general 
thanks people like wish real conservative party liberals convince it helps best policies get enacted 
know lot issues republicans time recently gotten much worse feel bad reasonable conservatives put catch people left 
except catholic mexicans philipinos conservative 
that absurd you donate volunteer whoever nominee better trump we need willing put preferences aside comes work hard elect someone any candidate name get amount material support if able give warren rock 
to honest reality tv without scare quotes it game show and frankly calling host feels even damning reality tv 
think she'll come anyone primary she's said pretty much bluenomatterwho democrats need stop infighting i'm sure supportive general though 
consider self conservative believe slow carful continual progress pay plans prove worth cost revert back outcomes wind when doubt wait data the reason advocating largest progressive twofold one little long giant list really good ideas tons backing trying we one time last years but since gridlock cat two warren specifically hunting improved pushing specific ideology if something works shown work stop this should every candidate seems pretty rare days catch us and republicans defended trump unlikely i'll vote republican 
i'm concerned the notorious rbg going die within next years she needs replaced someone much younger and knows maybe kavanaugh slip banana peel 
the us government fucking joke rock identical political experience trump clue values elizabeth warren old her vp might need take reigns could worse idea additionally chooses everything saying outright lie 
oh yeah definitely every she'll post letters writes politicians definitely get younger americans care who's government 
this used imagine politics works we progressives pushing us towards well progress conservatives saying hold let's make sure idea feasible thought important give take let society meaningful ways unfortunately i've come understand conservative actually means conserving much money rich possible hope get continue grow conservatism truly 
trump certainly avatar conservatism he paragon destruction chaos dishonesty whole host ills 
one little progress long giant list really good ideas tons data backing worth trying i'm curious conservative it may differ mine big three medicare all end perpetual war give state department funds diplomatic missions encourage relationships negotiations tools disposal like economic sanction etc education specifically talking eliminate college debt everything education system needs hard looking teacher salaries standardized testing funding semi public universities 
and knows maybe kavanaugh slip banana peel into gorilla cage 
agree sentiment no political neophytes running potus vp 
yeah could pretended gotten away reinforces joke candidate exactly memorable chuckle 
their idea conservatism is modern gop regressive conservative conservatism slow march carefully towards progress regressivism hard push back prior state time regression without regard continued active disdain 
secret democrat donated clinton fox news 
there quite lot things currently not work dozen little education tend revenue positive but biggest thing actually climate change time programs strategies use fight climate change ever stick something corruption we can't another years gradual progress republican undoing think anything conservative trying keep planet habitable people live 
but biggest thing actually climate change time work exactly this bipartisan issue parents got survey rnc lamenting democrat's costly fixation climate change 
wow how miss climate change i'm vegetarian reasons very thoughtful also reading comments seems like overturning citizens united would best actionable item start lot issues 
the reason not bipartisan lobbyists corporate interests found turn partisan issue get want half time they pay republicans say exist feed voters misinformation fear vote republican this turns viscous cycle if take tools away see way effort way less pushback republicans least think actually faster need go subject climate change 
hear ya fairly typical eating meat every day since reduced less week climate reasons sadly driving ton much done avoid so paragon low carbon trying reduce inside control at point carbon tax correct market imbalances but one going unpopular think need work equally important palatable things first the list damn long way get piece as luck rest human civilization stuff would like time 
agreed rooting corruption key climate action progress 
always subscribe best mentality it's easier get population cut meat consumption half go vegetarian

assuming still around probably wont i'm willing bet work de legitimize whole democratic process claim dnc propping stealing candidacy away joe and that's trump worked hard make sure clean enough run reality distortion field 
acceptable context yasss kweeen used tbh 
can wait great things with native background touch america go warren 
this cnn's app thing marriage clip even full one cnn really sucks video distribution 
hey say username incredible lol 
why assume questioner conservative he phrased question hypothetical 
the way happens understanding what's going clip think pretty clear 
if talking actual questioner https mobile twitter com morganwcox status hypothetical he's pro gay marriage works human rights campaign one assumes agrees 
if straight people good marriage might argument 
think late us distinguish types marriage point the word construct intertwined social structure try rename either legal religious without inciting ton protest plus fear distinguishing opens new doors justified discrimination it's hard enough married gay couples adopt gave agencies wiggle room say oh accept religiously can't since sorry 
given overwhelming response including people thread say tipping toward i'd latter demonstrably untrue 
not perfect quote question what would say constituent said my faith strongly convinced marriage one man woman answer i'm going assume saying and tell okay marry audience applause find goes wild 
did listen rest follow question stfu she gave honest answer zinger talked faith raised taught all people regardless orientation loved god eyes 
elizabeth warren we must call remain silent initiate impeachment proceedings hold accountable and build unstoppable grassroots movement resoundingly defeats trump complicit republicans everywhere 
really liking quote lately we must always take sides neutrality helps oppressor never victim silence encourages tormentor tormented elie wiesel 
she gets these people need defeated 
much agree and even though impeachment vote failed yesterday fact democrats voted time last resolution attempted 
sent strong letter house rep signed justice democrats try find someone primary done weak democrats 
tiring trying hold people accountable thank you ewarren 
she right focus cannot solely rest trump might mouthpiece numerous republicans democrats continually make excuses equivocate otherwise provide cover hateful antics we horrified says really effectively exposed racist underbelly country brought harsh light day get frustrated sometimes happening elizabeth warren demonstrated frame conversation try keep values important us rather partisan hackery 
is liz first candidate call republicans complicit 
this great list turncoat democrats aiding abetting trump https www cnn com politics democrats voted trump impeachment resolution index html interestingly also lines fund concentration camps source govtrack us congress votes 
i'm torn it's good warren publicly demands impeachment the train needs start rolling but also see pelosi board right no matter process starts end it die senate trump impeached that's given goal hearings expose much evidence possible put administration pressure and tied election seem wise year various house committees already great job let finish investigations culminate investigation wait next elections problem course huge number democrats progressives growing impatient they voted they're miffed started completely understandable helpful however i've tried many times talk people get anger downvotes sure quite concern trolls pretty sure disappointment real really 
but said native american found clutches pearls omg the horror ahhh socialism buttery males 
now we're talking this exactly but throw pelosi idea anything political suicide ought instantly impeachable remove ones fancy careers job representing people that's entirely problem make promises get elected treat voters like common criminals ignore mock dismiss whatever fuck want thinking serving they're they seem understand going away long sparks full blown violent bloody revolution targets backs coming need jobs both sides that upholding constitution the will of people not 
and might change mind never take dark corporate donations 
and non cooperation evil much duty good gandhi 
that motherfucking stick we must intolerant intolerance tolerant everything else you irrationally like immigrants minorities fine fuck get nothing society offer part 
you know raging since last night post really helped calm maybe progress 
impeachment proceedings begin really begun weeks mueller report actually voting impeachment serious hearings dumb look crazy people already choir never result trump removed office entire point convince paying much attention impeached orcing republican congressmen go record pissing potential voters convinced don't enable bad precedents i'm overly happy democratic leadership managing messaging various threats enablers pose republic jumping straight week hearing without thoroughly describing treason bribery high crimes misdemeanors make sense neither threatening primary congresspeople 
my rep supposed democrat voted impeachment last night expressed intense rage utter contempt phone morning she lost vote primary 
trump symptom disease look lindsay graham he's obviously gay support forever 
guys villainize fellow dems voting immigration bill yes fucking shit real people drinking toilet bowls treated like filth detention centers we luxury pnly vote perfect bills rn wtf tell families ask give funding help conditions if want action terms helping camps need look opportunities least r's hopefully sending real relief don't demonize dems this urgent situation desperate times desperate measures any issue different story historical humanitarian crisis hands you blame pelosi wanting get something done dentention or squad better deal one ensured sone money passed would actually go 
get saying waiting i'm afraid pelosi never she waited failed hold bush accountable bullshit self impeachment seems like ever want impeach trump well 
congress constitutional duty impeach this politics optics constitution elected officials uphold 
disagree every day wait children die at border stop enabling 
no bullshit many crimes embarrassments happened need held accountable sure pass senate so what that makes publicly complicit trump's people keep saying oh impeachment fails raise approval rating maybe past anymore way thinking dead after last years apparent nothing change numbers nothing 
no one's said we'll never pelosi known politically brilliant despises trump the odds waiting perfect timing election cycle next year keep whole thing fresh voters' minds 
those make peaceful revolution impossible violent inevitable jfk 
this one there comes time silence betrayal our lives begin end day become silent things matter in remember words enemies friends mlk 
part problem silence fact politically incorrect not give lunatics psychopaths fucktards platform free speech great automatically include giving unstable criminals right make rules anyone else the trump supporters insane influence religious delusion they say believe whatever want government shred consideration base nobody sane going allow tin foil hat wearing fundamentalist religious hateful corrupt uncle decide what's best rest family stood silent shit became norm 
if put half effort researching issue writing drivel would know reason money running influx migrants exorbitant fees dhs paying private prison companies run concentration camps john kelly board core civic fyi you're eating bullshit right wing media shoveling in american people gave house majority dems funds really necessary democrats vote clean version bill republican senate they could gotten concessions protection children no passes without dem approval instead gleefully funded trump's 
nah fuck em it costs per person day house people dog kennels that's going grift skimming 
uys villainize fellow dems voting immigration bill demonize contribute intolerant actions society political identity care party anyone's fucking career true i'll never vote gop ever remain silent corrupt measure deserve thrown they've ruined lives enabled death children name tolerance 
bush going leave office either way retrospect doubt impeachment would've made enough marginal impact results that said strongly disagree pelosi shutting door especially mueller's public comments she take overly calculated positions simple matter principle if votes impeach whip 
pelosi never impeach one republican democrat green etc matter crime evidence pelsoi needs resign 
exactly this no voter ever fucking political 'identity' the constitution matters party ineffective weak speaker house 
mcconnell simply refuse bring vote illegal yes who's going stop 
impeachment going stop senate convict sends message future presidents nothing ever rise level impeachment force senators cast votes saying corruption disrespect law ok 
you read comment he said impeachment needs happen just right away there's real possibility proceedings early time election rolls around independents need vote forgotten laundry list crimes embarrassments trump done office well senators voted maybe agree least respect pelosi might reservations soon the real bullshit wpuld never impeaches makes top much sense run hearings closer timing would optimal politically long do hold duty constitution regardless 
hope right every day gets away even dies senate needs done 
must confess past years gravely disappointed white moderate almost reached regrettable conclusion negro great stumbling block stride toward freedom white citizen counciler ku klux klanner devoted order justice prefers negative peace absence tension positive presence constantly says agree goal seek cannot methods direct action paternalistically believes set timetable another man lives mythical concept time advises wait convenient season mlk 
wtf wrong i'm right wing shill ffs telling dem congress people trying best give poor souls detention center sort help relief they disagree voting there's fucking cynical evil shit going dems issue centers smoking assume otherwise 
the fuck talking all saying democrat congress rn detention center crisis going limited options you pretty much either hold perfect bill poor people suffer centers or work hard get border pass hopes relieve way whole contribute fascism tyranny administration thing fine not issue every second spend holding better they're suffering whether believe agree description situation currently cannot dem congress voted yes there's cynicism thought best victims 
pelosi's failure impeach bush shows lack principle part even though going leave office either way holding accountable would still sent clear message he ever held horrible see image rehabilitated since left think political calculation may similar figures trump probably anyway it's wrong approach 
bet pelosi she's cunning i'm going need source other taking bribes donations dnc see effective 
bush cheney rumsfield rotting together cell rest lives war crimes obama impeached destroying th amendment eveyone likes pretend never happened trump go guillotine white house lawn then only would chance true justice peace prosperity 
think lack principle poor reading happened clinton impeached democrats gain house seats aftermath clinton's acquittal pelosi likely want lose strong incumbents swing districts however multiple ways make impeachment trump advantageous worry ignoring much misguided reasons 
elizabeth's portrait harvard law covered thank you notes 
no doubt continue persist fight policy one way another i'm excited see what's next warren 
as aspiring attorney liz inspiration hope keeps fight continues inspire many

seriously disappointed while bad hillary lost feeling similar feelings as teacher supportive warren policies she understood like educator felt represented smart capable showed courage devour billionaire soul national stage would amazing president sad get chance 
perhaps biden pick running mate gets dem nomination hopefully see way heal party alienate progressive base hillary 
we're getting closer every day hopefully someday we'll actually get 
kind cool put fire alarm next picture 
bruce would've made exceptional first gentleman seeing scholar supportive husband next leader free world would lot undo toxic masculinity american culture 
i'm side country appearance snl gave moment healing instead 
i'm almost certain going biden klobuchar female midwestern seat safe party choose leave senate 
janitor ah shit comes another billionaire's rich kid quick someone grab extinguisher liz did hear billionaire no needs little roast'in demonic portrait noise stahp 
we'd need progressive white house schumer well liked democratic establishment 
thought lot last months we need models supportive devoted masculinity 
the way protectively stood behind giving concession speech spoke volumes mentions bruce drove town hall vermont tell he's every step 
no biden pick kamala harris another woman color perhaps stacey abrams he would wise warren make concessions platform appease progressives less stay home vote rd party though 
ugh having opportunity pick one two women lasted super tuesday represents part party feels ignored unwanted picking klobuchar would absolutely peak biden feel inevitable course 
if going choose female midwestern vp think tammy baldwin duckworth would better choices 
it'll probably young er woman color maybe kamala harris 
please remember stay civil many us different rankings warren please try respect fact 
schumer gets bullied mcconnell cracks pressure look big flubbed supreme court threat justice roberts made look like idiot if warren would thrilled got vp hope someone else leader position ducksworth feinstein brown maybe 
agree going woman think pick color though biden great rapport african american community already necessarily advantageous picking white would admin probably include ag kamala harris nsa director pete buttigieg 
he would wise pick warren make concessions platform appease progressives seen people argue harris extremely progressive voting record problem also got problematic https www vox com future perfect kamala harris president campaign criminal justice time california attorney general she dealbreaker biden puts ticket steps aside going really hard making case get nomination 
would love brown duckworth got say feinstein constituent mean obviously liz see less likely unfortunately 
buttigieg might better un ambassador secretary state feel like vp would someone democratic party wants groom run biden serve one term they want woman still think kamala harris fits bill we see end correct 
everyone problematic record including sanders spend 's tough crime harris got slandered like warren scorched earthers actually wants champion criminal justice reform she going hard time years good luck kamala cop rhetoric 
if would like discuss removal please send mod mail

she going hard time spend years criminal justice reform look forward seeing fwiw follow number prominent civil rights defense attorneys platforms twitter etc they welcome genuine also see bullshit nanosecond waste calling engage faux 
voting volunteering donating whoever nominee ultimately sounds like miscommunication sanders allow discussed gender politics meeting seems pretty minor next obstruction justice putting hit us ambassador eminent extinction half species earth call concentration camps border 
also media needs front center trump parnas impeachment 
we appreciate and believe vitriol incited randos also fight like hell make nominee whoever president 
think important remember there's concerted effort divide democratic base ahead general just saying 
this exactly feel bernie i'd still extremely happy he's nominee think important remember vitriolic comments seem everywhere internet toward warren represent small number people congruent real world hopefully saying things swayed reasonable

bernie elizabeth supporter resolved vote whomever delegate lead comes time state love let smears distract goal get progressive white house 
despite fighting third way published ugly editorial today's wapo claiming bernie unelectable defended comment section for sake sides care put behind us by way biden supporters agreeing op ed we focusing keeping nominee petty crap 
maybe standards low want someone trump if warren sanders lied one thing fucking irrelevant every way guy office right lies times per day

same actually know vote just whoever leading time georgia comes want biden general gets nomination 
bernie supporter feel way so bummed infighting she vote contention 
my disappointment believe bernie say wish could address meant means regardless bernie's actual words relayed game telephone thar legitimate concern there still portion country persuaded outright sexism that trump anything win exploiting help russians facebook plausible deniabilty fight time might best introduce reptile brain variables states less votes get determine fate and think counterpoint absolutely people getting us xenophobic neanderthals voting booth instead nuanced discussion woman million sitting home takes ensure happen turned media nonsense 
as fellow bernard bro well lady yes 
i'm also bernie supporter completely agree suspect least folks sub berners based occasionally lurking 
thanks posting feel way bernie worried might minority supporters though least visible online does anyone know percentage bust voters camp 
this post makes bernie bro advocate preferred candidate 
like i've donated feel liz liar bernie would say woman president likely miscommunication 
bernie bro sexist term trivializes majority female base 
even bernie lol this reminded pretty hilarious mcsweeney https www mcsweeneys net articles candidate seems progressive name bernie enough article wife shared 
same bored drama entertaining take grain salt 
the infighting drummed bots why seem favor bernie beyond needs shut shit hard he's get vote assuming nominee 
i'm sure russia behind campaign divide bernie warren groups over night hashtags start trending see many bots twitter it would incredibly helpful warren put joint statement help alleviate division even bs optics 
ditto the trolls legitimately angry bernie bros pass we know happened looking repeat just takes figure put pitchforks handed many media 
wish mom dad would stop fighting 
please call bernie bro know sub likes use really wish play along the thing stayed 
thanks feel way warren side think said sadness country sexist disappointed time he can't explain without media taking context still team also address would damage campaign it's unfortunate situation honestly though many people share fears including female partner good finally got issue win 
if bernie say need argue we'll prove wrong 
tense horrid arguments family members ultimately still love forgive get mind bernie warren recall details said forgettable moment staff we quick society lately burn people stake smallest little infraction infuriating remember everyone permanent gop control government mob charge perpetuity 
agreed she still choice would pick warren every candidate miles rest corp dem trash vote heartbeat want feel heart true supporter like hopefully bernie opposite case make nomination come together jump support remaining progressive candidate gladly hop bandwagon dropped hope supporters cant imagine or supporter jumping biden buttigieg god forbid the trump campaign 
woman bernie feel exact way even said ''let's focus much donald trump media wants us do'' 
think issue huge negative progressive movement know warren's team thinking trying make at best distraction real issues worst looks like took something months ago that's complete said thing made days last debate voting starts nobody wants bickering the online polls i've seen mostly sided care dispute all give america view bad behavior warren sanders non surprised numbers go unfortunately 
believe bernie thinks women win abby cnn moderator incredibly unfair biased sit well least acknowledge warren felt heard enemy she progressive like expect bit empathy towards situation trouble letting go 
most bernie supporters share sentiment included unfortunately people sides assume vocal reddit twitter expressing feelings majority they ones feel need talk 
maybe referring sanders supporter insultingly bernie bro telling want accomplish together good look 
how fuck bernie bro fuck outta 
maga good luck guys fucked 
know heart conversation went like ew we split progressive vote bernie please support bs better chance general look happened hillary and see really sides telling truth 
thank think lot bad faith actors trying divide us sure much twitter reddit real one thing add this strategic mistake warren said dumb hill die it's private conversation played public permitting msm make issue distraction playing manipulation there literally way bernie win battle fought the best kill story even demonstrated last election one cares damn emails statement our enemy corporate status quo not manipulated bs 
when i'm canvassing tell bernie folks would happy liz bernie could split cali cut candidates 
mean stuff really bad ok mad other's candidate it's natural let's that's make us lose bernie supporter 
warren finds best solution tools available she problem solver executive top honest politician behaves kind like scientist using tech time build new bernie saw going saying that's need go without helping us get passing bills building agencies people make bernie's visions come true actually fix things passed term senator entire career 
as bernie supporter whole debacle really left feeling hurt many ways but throw full support behind whoever candidate continue progressive movement matter hope blows liz go back close friends stronger allies 
lol writing bernie bro legitimize content reality would never call fake news like 
also bernie bro defending warren though beginning said years would make great president if og least still transformative even joined sub ages ago love seeing good news stories gotta say thoroughly disappointed played think allow smear like go uncorrected clarified and someone extends hand public stage especially friend people shake beef talk privately this camp talking unity week criticizing candidates biggest ally race smeared sexist really want misunderstanding liz comes explains happened happy give benefit doubt move pretend happen sake uniting left understand last hours you put toothpaste back tube may end disaster greatest hope saving american empire entire world kind trickery media manipulation divides side lose one chance 
really fence two made mind though vote either disappointed 
strong reservations warren regards whole situation i'm still going vote whomever gets nomination even truly problematic joe biden in front runners 
if bernie liz value unity here's thought publicly endorse it would major sign it's vote the supporters endorsements etc team they're still friends allies cnn failed 
question warren supporters think getting good advice advisors regarding want ugly episode behind everyone asap 
wish warren elaborated believe heard want know believes bernie dead serious thought woman could win this far positions stood documented proof contrary even better joint statement gives cover 
gonna get laid man clever though 
yet make mind vote but attack warren supporters bernie bros top paid surrogates new and sanders encourages cult like following when last time asked volunteers spread false negative stories opponents 
pretty sure bernie bro thinking rationally 
yes thing hurt news cycle democrats 
bernie tactful convo warren that's everything else dumb drama needs keep bamf 
cnn jumped fox news territory mind 
or even preventing student loans able discharged bankruptcy architect behind democratic party support two wars iraq harassment anita hill supreme court confirmation hearing numerous grievances everyone would consider supporting either warren sanders first place towards biden legitimately hurt whole thing care said entirely issues focused less personality character flaws woke opinions long remain completely committed progressive movements goals around economic racial environmental political justice both campaign magnifying issue sake fundraising i'd much rather seen debate different merits various policy proposals never compared others 
they really need meet privately hash things two candidates proxies staffers put joint statement kind whole thing bed all helping biden buttigieg

that taking stance vote favorate primaries nominee support percent general election one democrats would way better trump 
actually glad bloomberg fair game he real democrat absolutely deserves coming all patriots stage give em hell liz 
if bloomberg ends nominee it'll confirm american voters care wealth ads appealing sound bites actual substance awful billionaires row sorry sounds pretentious i'm getting really frustrated dumb electorate proven 
maybe feel like debates less effect used arguably clinton changed many minds even want see call bloomberg hubris entertaining least 
damn liz i'm bernie guy recognize good tweet see one 
she's destroying debate sweep leg liz 
elizabeth warren makes promise delivers 
consider miniboss candidates need overcome order reach general election he's absolutely carpet bombing forms media nonsense launched polls advertising far influential low information voters think like believe where get additionally concerned starts spending megabillions attacking could lasting detrimental effects way 
warren bring one debate stage great tweet 
i'm glad got debate way answer juggernaut campaign ads 
i'm bernie supporter god warren fire last night absolutely bodied bloomberg it reminded well done senator well 
of course there justifiable reason guy polling allowed debates is terrible he's trying buy election yes support 
as new yorker bloomberg great job problematic things happening 
ikr at first mad bloomberg made debate stage realized time actually going subjected harsh push back 
if bloomberg nominee honestly idea i'd vote 
nothing new the fact trump president enough fear country capable governing 
true degree but remember one good debate performance also catapulted klobuchar obscurity surging narrative helped enormously nh overall media attention part recency effect think debates happen people vote influence thinking especially undecided 
what odd people watch debates piece podcast talking even big deal recently watched insiders feel like modern really convince anyone anything since repetitive points clearly matters youtube ads 
think wrong debates often comes waves donations candidates well 
debates general election matter little increasingly polarized people know side in primary everyone team well liked voters except bloomberg cause big shifts polls see kamala last summer see klobuchar week 
the biggest problem debates lot people tune rely headlines clips next day unfortunately media outlets going paint story narrative regardless true context live suprised see bloomberg highlights tonight one final push clown super 
at least chance vetted running nonstop commercials obama without face hard questions push back rising polls fast and news stations show highlights even people watch actual debates see get taken peg two 
she st one hand trump nd rd basically tie 
clinton debates trump second one disastrous first 
also one debates clinton used infamous deplorables line work favor 
worried that turns bloomberg sanders emerge super tuesday front runners full scorched earth using supporters wads cash and end bruised vote suppressed trump ekes win feel lot like election lose yet might eff 
they relax donor threshold polls others people required number donors polling vice versa allowed stage 
hey this hurts soul remove rule four please refrain calling snake the rest fine 
some problematic things kalief browder whole lotta brown folks would say differently 
as puerto rican new yorker say stop frisk bullshit directly affected people family scum bag 
appreciate perspective pretty clear person color 
it sounds never unconstitutionally stopped frisked right 
can clarify that's vague comment 
not education teacher administration and terrible you run city like business 
understand frustration kind thinking counterproductive want see real change yes dnc disgustingly corrupt bloomberg able buy way stage path democratic primary point time warren sanders recognize 
wait if unhappy joining race vote 
look he's done empty words 
one candidate existential threat country moderate republican reform healthcare system provide public option to even difficult question going plug nose vote any dem bernie mike pete liz amy biden please blue matter who abstaining voting rd party donald trump 
just stop like bloomberg even tiniest little bit trump existential threat people color women immigrants anyone integrity works federal government marginalized to vote nominee inexcusable it's basically saying cool picking ruth bader ginsberg's replacement us ensure climate changes makes country unlivable years learn difference profound disappointment 
i'm going vote candidate believes climate change working address 
true dat edit think remember hearing debate picked last minute decision voters that's good thing 
one remember getting really high marks way back october november going warren pete think singular debate matters trend several debates actually it's people pissed lack 
same thing happened kamala harris one debate 
everytime debate or primary caucus media always talks something reason happens koblosurge pete possibly winning biden's campaign shambles bloomberg attributed polling combative warren it biden surged summer fall kamala exploded popularity died and finally partly sanders lost primaries clinton completely painted absolutely evil conniving trump literally one took narrative twisted positive 
i've already decided i'll vote debate going change mind 
oh man they're bloomberg time 
matters debates pundits msm choose spin they literally deciding nominee going want sanders trump 
debate clips however played media part effect perception 
understand people use adblocker youtube 
that also fair point considered 
well someone comments right she killed last night apparently pretty baller fundraising numbers 
no fund raiser https en wikipedia org wiki basket deplorables she planned deploy public 
we're trying enforce rule fairly possible despite many us similar feelings bloomberg want keep things centered policy instead straight attacks criticizing past statements welcome though especially since skeletons closet mistaken morgue edit typo 
bloomberg would still need get people vote hope money enough win 
the donor threshold never kept anyone polling actual measure voting support it would literally unethical bloomberg ask regular people donate money billionaire appear stage dnc push 
yeah bloomberg way better made debate stage huh 
as child remember literally every teacher way fight bloomberg it kind funny absolutely despised talk protesting randomly us elementary middle school kids 
removed there nothing comment indicating user trolling in future suspect simply report move 
the path change losing understand stop happening abstained registered democrat year vote either bernie warren moment saw headline knew made mistake i'm ashamed name tied party participate primary start holding fair elections think that's much expect 
think unhappy party allowing bloomberg run democrat which totally understand 
that would legitimize party allowing someone buy way election it's exact type blatant corruption want see gone refuse part you guys independents come side stop fucking cheating primaries 
absolutely the us government survive even bloomberg trump declaring supreme law enforcement officer able order prosecutors around protect cronies there debate one i'd vote forced choice really hope happen 
trump bad vote dem nom bloomberg's role stop frisk redlining comments last decade god awful minorities learned nda women companies debate makes even worse thought worst we'll ever get biden least improvement previous positions recent statements incredibly point election mild form racism sexism still would nominee think one anyways 
in nevada caucus like iowa especially important second choice candidates so regard debate particularly 
really recall going warren she drew contrasts strike aggressive style contrast gone pete much harder if end saddled centrist nominee far top choice 
there's large part electorate decided 
i've notice bernie supporters turned running joke posting nice things bloomberg putting paid president which kind funny 
you really think want sanders trump insert moderate 
they literally deciding nominee going want sanders trump yeah reflect see media unless mean social 
right usually zingers little policy differences this trump nomination endless clips douche candidates made people laugh 
boom moderator burn good luck bloomberg 
it turned people taking pot shots bringing but change ethically bought spot dangerous what actually charismatic spoke well convinced america good choice we need get money politics many would make excellent president one hears poor even consider running anything 
don't obstinate you joined party reason one last thing the garbage charge this better decent politicians running hold nose needs done 
get unhappy party voting going change you can't something participate 
vote candidates right choices prioritize rooting corruption that shot cleanse party hopefully country independents lot clout would advise strategic understand 
same honestly at least straightforward politically speaking 
long days corporations trying sell things need 
it's shallow af sometimes zingers least based reality would like bloomberg subject like warren maybe saying busy buying way race meeting listening real people talk lives economy worked biden claiming close ties obama exist 
she got asked debate though but yeah unwise enough come think winning move 
already acknowledged problems tenure no need aggressively hop 
happily vote general i'm also registering independent abstaining farce primary 
instead trying sell us candidate need

elizabeth warren jumps first place new moveon straw poll 
warren points last straw poll taken moveon members edges closest rival sanders also top second choice 
hope trend continues liz inspiring candidate race there excitement even though laying detailed policy proposals 
think rule get less mike gravel poll required drop race 
i've donating warren sanders truly like respect worked sanders' campaign see lot energy building supporters composed fashion think previous threw open door ideas actually capacity deliver also speaking years find excellent nuts bolts governance moreover pointed communications explanations she many gotcha moments video delicious watch today donated instead weekly might donate depending things shape certainly nominated that said excited totally wondering would make good running mate 
full results http moveon org good see warren also top second choice candidate nationwide earliest primary states 
good bad let's remember polls mean much far first primary edit though advantage reminding names candidates keep forgetting even exist wayne messam seth moulton mike gravel feel like pollsters invent random candidate see many people close eyes pick name finger lands 
is anyone aware interfering factors poll mean unethically straw serious business common request supporters respond i'm mainly referring call voting moveon many us responded https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments usyp action go support warren moveonorg get link think got directed vote somewhere else high five guess the moral overestimate means normal polling this warren comparatively large number high information moderately involved called we already knew leads progressive democrats voters broadly often leading indicator race shift because informed buried scandal exposed rhetoric candidates general electorate ends months later so insignificant shows different things representative randomized 
good hear while sanders top choice definitely great second 
hopefully warren continues rising good know polls useful yet straw especially predictive anything 
want remind everyone early race also horribly conducted poll even score great sign 
she nominee the debates make even clear people one that's exactly happened seeing obama stage hillary others throughout summer made best candidate edit add started april per month comparatively first democratic debate election october gave enough time competitor generate organic support far ahead point lead times allow overcome except built much name recognition based raw political ability so obvious way year biden national centrist liz warren better politician progressive visionary joe less 
i'd argue there's excitement putting detailed policy proposals at point voters want someone least lay framework ideas hope they'll able execute 
can't wait rd th debate people actually support participate 
would like offer silent rock drop video evidence argument 
donated last week know much i'm wealthy person plan give least election every time hear talk feel inspired hopeful future working towards 
right these two realistic candidates i'd head polls smiling vote still warren they're tenacious principled intellectual curiosity work ethic admire much 
think that's part gets excited even first choice sounds like progressives would satisfied even also thrilled she's definitely need right 
c'mon everyone knows mike gravel 
well fair also posted https np reddit com sandersforpresident comments wm moveon presidential strawpoll vote utm source android sanders fans tend brigade kind polls anything skewed towards also members moveon voted 
history says otherwise hillary popular vote warren much stronger candidate 
i'm huge bernie supporter donating monthly campaign years donated warren first time plan very pleased running think pull 
seconding three years what's amounted executive chaos list well thought policy proposals far get trump the public's starting realize plans beat twitter shows 
agree her well articulated policy proposals breath fresh air making fun people see difference detailed plan campaign slogan 
i'd tack detailed proposals charismatic thoughtful communicator without second part she'd much like another candidate laundry list policy look got 
would say could reason stay congress the executive branch write policies support sign she coming ton showing powerhouse government actually passes laws losing powerful person leaves 
seen far many exact comments concerns stated way bringing two issues thoroughly debunked she's co sponsoring bernie's medicare all proposal https www warren senate gov newsroom press releases joins sanders senators reintroduce medicare senate there nothing wishy washy fully supports said excuse stopping half measures nytimes com us politics democrats public option html no one sworn big donations general even bernie trump million campaign fund fec data candidate certainly balloon move toward election democrats know grassroots funding campaigns cannot generate level power looking fight topics concerned from supporter another team enter the concern troll washingtonpost blogs compost wp enter concern troll utm term daa aa 
she signed onto think reason gotten specifics probably plan works considering depth number proposals already released reframing debate makes sense would health care well fact proposal let government manufacture generic forms drugs like insulin allow medicare negotiate likely going time release around significant event plans plenty considering far right 
on medicare for all bill that's currently table i'm highly skeptical since work healthcare this industry notoriously resistant change lacks agility face mandated modernization to clear goes beyond always comes hard culture slow sector my take clinical practice due cautious overly analytical nature we years build evidence come new guidelines takes another couple providers individually accordingly saw problem hitech act https www ncbi nlm nih gov pmc articles pmc five implementation fell short lot goals barely met lowest bar electronic health record across board organizations still hcos using paper records now look congress th house text year schedule passes two scale private insurance zero warren's response reads someone damage attempting reach goal it sounds completely line wants get everyone make sure we're things right front it's enough idea matters if specifics bernie running actually opposed would mean hell colleagues realistically speaking could imagine shutdown reduce staff stay afloat transition period that leaves huge holes people fall 
it took week longer sanders warren sign tyt's progressive policy pledge one point medicare all that's clearly commitment form holding back announcing policy reason we expect make splash the lack healthcare fair skeptical pledge reassuring it's also media powerhouse would pay dearly betraying word as far general election actually agree money thing strategy explain concern course corruption proven reliably assuming becomes democratic nominee party platform set donors influence but sadly us elections shown deeply affected advertising portrayal unilateral disarmament smart for bernie refusing big finance final stretch creates possible financial issue nominee democratic ads come pacs leverage if even coordinates ad good compromising principled position mostly unfairly spun political price i'd rather promise way confusing voters later cedes control messaging outside groups right really needs lead entire movement because trump sure controls in cases progressive wealthy anti donors rock hard place there give say selecting presidential cabinet like obama allowed banks trading selections cash hypothetical considering going fight hillary dirty regulators i'm betting trust tend go much detail that's mr 
you're right spelled plan yet co sponsored bernie's so somewhat encouraging progressives but believe one sticking points warren sanders fight think point debates come blows really doubt adopt strategy effective nationalization health insurance industry do good hell yeah voters go along not chance people extremely protective healthcare plans knows imagine she'll taking incrementalist approach solving public option alongside regulated private foreseeable future that definitely primary race goes like line drawn two agree revolution minded probably back bernie there's logic behind approaches warren's winning edit wrong gives unqualified endorsement care i'm surprised pleased 
want still represent us senate house 
yeah kind bs warren stage front runners maybe they'll deliberately reshuffle july could good opportunity stand build momentum but really want see bernie able debate nuances progressive policy instead squaring bunch centrists i'm cool either nominee 
think everyone deserves chance campaigning debate can't muster support focus candidates 
great video donated hoping he'd make debates see yell centrists fingers crossed next month kind embarrassing seth moulton best manufactured moderate dem presidential resume imaginable losing someone even running win 
good makes result significant i'm loving optimism comments

said lose general election win popular vote 
really hope warren emerges leader bernie supporters embrace like her plans overlap ton bernie's see reason of course also democrats rally around wins nomination however polling seen suggests better positioned win specifically close terms polls asking voters first choice leads everyone second third place behind biden candidate he's ranked low voters' so basically either love winning formula the data elizabeth one 
this true because would mean folks voted bernie might sexist idiots that actually disagreed hilary policies 
it's analogy analogies offer useful comparative examples am also stuck make comparison election not every mention hillary clinton means someone past 
executive chaos fantastic term think i'll start using 
warren policies progressive clinton plus going fundraisers unlike 
the president's endorsement bill goes really far used suppose mean look slimy mitch mcconnell bends backwards never vote president support 
the lack healthcare policy fair reason skeptical thank reasonable support bernie warren big issue every supporters swears daylight sanders know he'll fight like hell settle nothing less single payer suspect would inclined pursue public option compromise path of course i'd proven wrong great see draft legislation as regards money think people corrupted general election at least it's bad look action that's consistent idea corrupts politics if even coordinates ad good compromising principled position already supposed illegal candidate coordinate pac they completely independent one another though reality never rule enforced 
the irony sherrod brown praised exact thing lmao 
do know dates july debates yet 
definitely think good thing this first debate day one if momentum might annoyed eyes mean bernie instead warren i'd pretty mad he'd get chance capture excitement stake claim ideas share he would attention take wind sails way gets forge path forward 
it's literally response giving facts whether poll skewed towards warren exactly say interpreted disparaging sanders 
right trump obama clinton bill predictable winners 
i'll one better happily campaign ass warren top runner left wing next couple months 
still going bernie believe convictions strongest but liz warren initially thought dna test blunder big overcome way past think handled fairly well the right give calling socialist enough stop people voting fuck 
almost bernie supporters would embrace warren enthusiastically gets nom the reverse true 
haha totally feel so frustrating 
think discussions hillary still useful interest letting past repeat when saw biden's announcement video chose focus exclusively trump's racist comments remember thinking why earth using hrc's playbook it work then south carolina democratic convention gave unfocused meandering laundry list reading bullet points campaign website another red flag flashes back hrc terrible candidate joe biden can't understand learn he's bad unelectable so yeah fair game talk 
the adhd presidency lots ideas energy little follow 
yeah write bills debate like congress 
it's vagueness worries why clear 
believe july least written calendar 
sanders fans tend brigade kind polls 
voters proved willing vote trump alternative liberal both clintons typically center road especially election time bernie success forced hilary move left would like cost warren far probably many many people begrudgingly avoid voting candidate know warren reddit darling sure easily better choice chances winning based politics put behind ball 
bet wait plans campaigning ahahaha see 
it's really warren supporters vote bernie would absolutely the difference moderate democrats versus why well lol democrat this always problem general election candidate compared best democratic candidates he's likely get support half voters so blame rather political reality many moderates going bernie's policies hardcore made mistake interpreting popularity outsider reflection perform actual presidential i'm saying win face tremendous pushback people fearful bring socialism us 
not true bernie close second choice if warren voter cares policy obvious no one else comes closes love progressive grandma grandad 
yeah biden looking lot like hillary worth remembering repeat mistakes to recognizing difference politician leader maybe good certain role senator congressman vice president think new york democratic leaning state widely respected massive campaign dredging negative things clintons combining disinformation but happened became national candidate came much baggage time spotlight easy link real history mostly successful public official murderers evil extreme liberal way conservative hillary's adviser runs child prostitution ring illegally traded uranium russia caused benghazi it exploit american ignorance erode support with similarly presidents take also long service made bad votes bit creepy emphasize exaggerate faults liz warren negatives native ancestry stuff actually done job addressing apologizing see minor mistake part and importantly something politics fit moment biden's he's centrist comes touch make sure beat republicans trump presidency senate need nominee going inspire young people vote historically high numbers warren's plans 
presidents request legislative members introduce certain bills 
it's literally true bad thing fact good way showing online support candidate but sanders supporters coordinated efforts vote polls that's reality 
hillary liberal people like many reasons that one what arguing everyone first impression and look policies listen story she progressive sure populist everything else trump cared dishonest fear mongering go back watch rallies wall street bankers robbing etc doubted day worked most care much anyway unfortunately want someone fight wealthy corporatists betrayed warren picked mantle honestly initial argument heard times give examples convert 
so blame warren supporters rather trying assign making observation that's supported polling data warren's closest rival terms policy bernie even close yet harris pete second choices voters falling well behind two even moveon poll choice respondents all came obviously would still mean less anecdotally ton i've seen say fucking despise sanders saying thing liz dumb stuff like corporate shill etc people think among top but comes general election really matter lot dems hate decide he's better trump what matters many much they'd stay home vote schultz number small people correctly imo said outsider status help says compared candidates independent swing demographics young liberal show often that's wins elections 
this argument never made sense all polls currently show biden sanders better numbers vs trump warren in significantly independents clinton even though uber progressive on top he's competitive rust belt basically pathway reelection popular actual moderates democratic party's the blame absolutely voters large degree if look second choice bernie bernie's recently started shift so take votes kamala beto pete former vote woman neoliberals yuppies white collar workers opposed blue compete 
if warren voter cares policy bernie obvious choice no one else comes closes agreed ahead liz mile next person list 
no brigading bad thing it's spirit online polls surveys and really true single sanders supporters others which say often yet another facet bernie bro slander that's happening since essentially portraying rude unruly childish 
hilary pushed left bernie success primaries put place uncomfortable and think second people voted trump aware quote made wall street overestimating 
seen sanders supporters say liz lol head wayofthebern stickied post almost always something trashing warren nowadays think though average supporter likely dislike agree may prone full disclosure fall latter group this pulling equal parts clinton coalitions evidenced fact harris tied top second choice it's sign strong candidate unite voters pretty different viewpoints across ideologies 
but look deeper polls warren one gaining ground last months ahead candidates second third choice among voters bernie first candidate poll well fourth that means abandon biden likely choose former clinton voted women lol really dude she got like million votes majority plenty supporters voting 
biden sanders known nationally warren it's similar hillary huge lead debates people knew candidates bernie eventually emerged debate season started once year like others get attention polls reflect review actual support know my prediction elizabeth october 
go literally dailykos straw polls know truth 
right said pushed left bernie but historically unpopular trump many reasons and first time heard liberal as people voting rallies bit confused think supported went voted know saying 
as said latest polling i've seen shows second choice warren voters not bernie he's distant third behind harris pete https twitter com waleedshahid status gained polls recently gains come expense thehill homenews campaign warren support rises two national yes conceded find supporters trashing especially sub mentioned but even probably rudest anywhere lot scorn towards diet version variety you'll see people saying tulsi better anyone much biden rest candidates named contrast many absolute bottom list like warren's comes hillary primary really picking based policy ideology 
she's one pete surged well know polls looking one's i've seen weeks back months showed biden's second choice sanders warren biden basically flat last couple maybe points gained expense kamala beto bernie though also past also seems like stopped surge you think significant bloc warren's voters support could first female president i've plenty comments people saying subreddit vote white old male just hrc voting woman many voted glass ceiling google pumas and antimale pro time coalescing around since gaining traction democratic voter base women even small part big enough unless somehow identity politics 
would imagine people rallies represent fraction percent voters candidate the vast majority voted trump never aware statements like 
as said latest polling i've seen shows second choice warren voters not bernie morning consult biden much common tied harris https morningconsult com democratic primary that's consistent you'll see people saying tulsi better anyone even rest candidates named someone hawaii who's followed actions since stuck calling progressive seriously bad take especially going try create purity test separate wayofthebern home busters points articles trashing front page it's honestly hard posts say think sub prefers also like assuming posting good faith please consider avoiding best toxicity likely actively manipulated actors np reddit comments ex warren supported third way cap neocons pe solid compromise candidate byffis tulsi gabbard bernie sanders bust like lot warren's support comes hillary really picking based policy ideology choosing among everyone else turned competing pete votes they're policies can't sanders effective leader 
elizabeth warren pledges appoint wealthy donors ambassador positions sweeping reform state department 
think pledge useful person qualified knew ambassador african country he significant donor presidential campaign also lived country question years spoke languages citizens big job zero issues donors similarly 
well shit why even donating month 
how putting people positions well educated countries would serve ambassadors 
us diplomats accept sinecure ambassadors sometimes even warm but across boards we'd prefer career foreign service fill vacancies source diplomat hence username 
to everyone getting upset reason headline one aspect sweeping state department reforms proposing besides would rather united states ambassador america's top allies someone expert ins outs country speaks major languages used knows work level staff handle crisis deeply understands represent views warren administration us department government donated lot money buy job this another corruption america we've grown numb 
so someone like angelina jolie wanted ambassador laos would automatically rejected or oprah winfrey candidate decades international relations experience even persons personal success factor 
i'm sure feel ambassadors cabinet roles if position i'd rule people engaged policy decisions 
making pledge cabinet positions would carry much weight this comes across stay headlines bit news warren currently choice influenced 
eh that's kinda ambassadorships always worked potted plant could serve ambassador london state department hundreds career employees talking counterparts uk pretty much constantly armed forces intelligence agencies etc edit 
under warren administration ambassadors required give free selfies anyone wants one fancy state dinners 
this one biggest holdovers political spoils era government positions professionalized aware countries see ambassadors jokes state department lost lot good people culmination career foreign service usually not ambassador someone expert representing us entire knows works 
umm thanks guess love warren thats baseline is extreme position 
get coming think problem many wealthy donors offered ambassadorships exchange financial support nothing short bribery there plenty qualified people really feel bad rich 
think living country speaking language enough qualify major foreign service position 
yeah surely equally qualified people aren't big donors 
think also little bit 'stretchy' inconsistent ultimately embassies ambassador representative key the majority serious work gets done working level folks ambassadors movers shakers to end disgenuous article characterises previous administrations yes obama appointed big time bundlers straight donors like current administration certainly yes favour they're typically assigned 'easier' countries western europe small bulk job making public speeches visiting schools friends tend good obviously conflict areas going require subject matter experts nice gesture warren's part especially fundraising strategy structured anyway mostly given 
there conflict interest people bribe way positions want help they going abuse position enrich 
shouldn't ambassadors united states america qualified person whoever donated imagine crisis another country want ambassador able work sync state department giving expert knowledge ins outs some us ambassadors america's allies experience speak major languages spoken gave lots money winning candidate 
did obama ever appoint cabinet position based donations would imagine trump administration outlier 
in case paying salary someone who's job essential i'm definitely ok 
yup this would make sense places need lavish parties but ambassadors time meet people country host dinners build relationships the embassy work obv 
considering obama used give bundlers positions yes 
exactly if qualified need purchase position first place wealthy philanthropist wants ambassadorship tailor philanthropy proving qualifications shell ambassador tier candidate kickstarter 
you think idea local politics knowing key players government able speak almost anyone living would helpful skill set ambassador 
it feels really weird giving obama pass rewarding campaign donations appointments desirable jobs to seems extremely corrupt definitely something everyone pledge 
certain areas yes many ambassadorships places like london wining dinning 
mostly going big bundlers mega donors it's like affluent warren supporter diplomatic background gives hard money max disqualified 
those thing important addition actual experience foreign policy one cousins deputy ambassador he degree region studies graduate international relations also years state department including working political officer country fluent language qualifications ambassadors 
it helpful lot less actual foreign policy experience clear history job performance diplomacy 
maybe difference terminology i'm looking qualifications disqualifications first none latter but want frame lack dqs qualification claim matter case i'd agree 
political appointments ethical fact appearance big donor getting position never going appear it always like bribe warren making right call time end moneys influence politics 
really think might helpful ambassador london expert history uk eu relations ireland given border northern who knows president warren would want future trade agreement independent maybe someone pick quickly good rapport also even wining dining important people behalf united states diplomatic 
for trump ambassadors gave million dollar donations inauguration there less oversight sdny investigating see laundering money fund barr stopped investigation continuing i'm hoping congress gets better look given hard get ny state taxes know would 
think things matter either working ambassador key ally eg uk nations great relationships important russia small staff this guy african nation ok much offer time need diplomacy minimal merely knowing leaders personal acquaintances friends seemed enough never going negotiating anything difficult 
disqualifications things would prevent getting security clearance being able get required fir sensitive positions 
note really think might helpful ambassador london expert history uk eu relations ireland given border northern sets false dilemma fallacy either reading comments wrong implying said something never 
then get original point view qualification big donor 
i'm saying people ambassadors bought job instead looking abilities alone 
my point income donations anything becoming ambassador most actual jobs require background diplomacy relationship nation changing treaties handled merely expert knowledge enough 
at least able speak language know anything substance country watching trump's picks trying answer basic senate questions cringe worthy 
of course large donations create possibility conflicts interest you're looking narrowly explicit job requirements 
there conflicts interest even without donations see logically rule someone 
juli castro endorses warren president 
it sounds like wins warren castro i'm shocked pleasantly surprised endorsed early 
best team primary cycle glad see endorsement someone ran campaign uplifting forgotten american voices 
sitting next husband wishing early dropouts would make endorsements voting begins bam happy see one sure 
i'm glad someone courage endorse ex candidates 
just watched joint video twitter happy he choice really nice see teaming together 
warren castro hope de blasio jay inslee endorse near future media desperately wants end warren's campaign needs help fight back 
you da real mvp excuse vp 
this exciting duo ages can get excited 
someone tell i'm idiot wrong first candidate nominee that's endorsed 
doesn't surprise he's vocally supportive warren even candidate his endorsement much welcomed though 
i'm home alone quietly screaming joy 
this awesome although completely unexpected saw together polk county steak fry looked really close 
not huge shocker he's ideal candidate vp slot but i'm surprised came early 
what like providing voice adopting ideas candidates able get much traction primary she telling stand important wants continue take forward 
ngl huge i've bouncing back yang sanders warren this fantastic endorsement really makes neck race can't believe i'm still undecided late glad vote iowa know i'd make decision hoping time state comes choice apparent although maybe that's bad thing 
iowa election caucus voter pre registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january www aclu ia org en find caucus site february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
high profile endorsement always good news however poll numbers warren's team needs focus ad buys preparing great debate performance january 
makes perfect sense though doubt significant impact race 
juli castro endorses warren's running mate 
is possible endorsing hope vp pick warren needs black person south imo castro wouldnt really help 
idk seeing hints warren yang 
really like castro anyone's vp donated keep debates think warren ticket would best 
mean harris want endorse doubt bernie pete maybe biden attacked already pretty badly 
hoping kamala would i'm assuming asking price high 
it's calculation courage castro get booker assuming polls correct booker's departure imminent 
reading comments find interesting bernie supporters attacking time claiming make difference supported there's something really ugly campaign complete turn 
agreed sad qualified candidates dropping inexperienced stay afloat 
didn't inslee already endorse adopted climate change plan 
great question there minor endorsements candidates dropped far none big ones this section wiki page lists dropouts endorsed anyone https en wikipedia org democratic party presidential primaries withdrew mike gravel gabbard sanders john hickenlooper michael bennet tim ryan joe biden and juli castro elizabeth warren think hope chance getting inslee harris o'rourke gillibrand know whether endorse there's clear leader though we'll see 
mike gravel dropped endorsed bernie last august though one could argue primary really begun yet edit also tim ryan biden 
sure if could get kamala's heading cali boost 
can collectively agree former democratic candidate endorses another simply primarily they're angling vp cabinet position they could sincere saying 
good optics ingratiate dropout candidates ideas campaign also suspect ideological standpoint castro harris odds terms policy admirably put forth one comprehensive criminal justice reform plans deserves credit hamd kamala attorney general california role carried punitive policies seen us hard sqaure give warren teaming lost praise support liz great needs sharpen pr skills consistent 
having options pretty great i'm late going pick whoever top two candidates plan canvass super tuesday state least 
why bouncing back forth what draws candidate guess course i'd like gauge priorities coming terms feel effectively deal 
he attacked biden fell fate kamala 
know that's necessarily true black voters overwhelmingly democratic might support whoever nominee castro could help energize hispanic demographic feels valuable edit definitely uncomfortable talk demographics way unfortunately big factor 
yeah that's probably likely think could okay like huge latinx following anyway they great chemistry though warren lot people since warm person 
i'm going go limb guess black person south 
warren needs black person south imo win if castro could back wi pa mi lose florida still regular even matter reason need eliminate electoral college 
warren needs black person black voters automatically vote candidates just look biden vs kamala like lot minority tend strategically primaries looking candidate that's mostly likely win still representing interests think signifying democratic party's faith diversity coalitions important particular person color makes onto top two slots must poc vp slot looks near certain white sorry booker and man woman would feel compelled pick though so surprised abrams 
andrew gillam perhaps help win fl problem castro prefer safe approach winning tx would awesome losing really bad 
this thinking no way would major candidates select castro vp 
would find ticket appealing always liked castro disappointing never got show like deserved anyway i'm thankful endorsement 
would beyond astounded ever happened 
i'm honestly sure getting downvoted warren yang seem great relationship incompatible messages approach problem solving put super likely lot good options far candidate chemistry potential merge seems like real possibility think castro fits bill much better though 
didn essentially say fiction automation taking away jobs 
if anything could ruin support warren would 
thought voice super necessary primary i'm sad dropped sooner wanted means he's advocate warren campaign rest least can't complain really hope vote castro ticket november well 
mean love respect aoc sure 
feel like harris waiting early primary states gauge warren momentum could absolutely imagine endorsing same rourke gillibrand inslee 
kamala fit ticket anyone wants run show she's like black version hillary doesn't stop hoping she'll endorse warren sanders would pleasantly surprised probably aligned biden buttigieg 
why would castro endorse booker drops 
castro warren good friends closely aligned politically would endorsed regardless political ambitions 
response pete camp interesting they really like castro 
there bad actors masquerading bernie supporters since lot pro propaganda intended divide democrats 
it's usually campaign surrogates like nina turner however dock still failing reign assholes one reasons first choice time 
bernies campaign still pretty mad various tinfoil real problems dnc interesting generally speaking result ride die it'll thing watch different groups peel suspend campaigns 
in opinion sincere effort dark forces right seed distrust among bernie supporters it see much vitriol online candidate the point convince enough unknowing people everyone except liar splinter party deny votes general anyone fact quite certain happening 
it ugly told low information voter voting interests black person considering hillary 
could see inslee gillibrand endorsing there's enough issue synergy also two pretty well contention vp position doubt either one would game changer still nice o' rourke unlikely endorse it's hard imagine world picks castro he seems likely biden though think pick white guy harris truly wildcard imo attractive candidate visible woman color democratic politics outside michelle obama make endorsement it really bold play bank warren wanting female ticket probably equal better chance getting ag wants administration my guess wait maybe opens early lead sadly scenario endorsements bernie starts pummeling close circle around try block nomination 
i'm holding hope inslee warren's vp pick castro endorsing early must mean promised sweet cabinet gig maybe sos 
oh man even call gravel technicality i'm totally wrong tim ryan endorsed biden hickenlooper bennett 
why would kamala endorse warren and know many ca view favorably when dropped specific polls dropping rapidly 
sooo think moulton never made debate actually run 
exactly castro strong progressive voice lot policies lined well warren's it makes sense he'd want person whose views sync best president 
it would hard square adopting entire platform she consistent approach let best ideas survive proud stick unworkable positions adaptable if something better comes along helps american people data back double worse position adopts better knows move football my concern bernie may paralyzed ideology effective president to continue analogy force make bizarre decisions like always going th punting as know achievable half measure solve big problem hits desk will sign or push never even hit concerned get nothing done doubling potentially dictates warren 
mean supported sanders thought would great female president lot policies and really worried heart attack drop but next debate performance amazing got critical aoc endorsement warren released plan people circle criticizes soft appreciate looked roadmap get created realistic solution also preferred sanders' response iran assassination meanwhile castro candidate addressed trans unprompted stage meant feel like another race totally number one so means much yang thing love candidates exploring he comes different field varied experience although definitely worry lack foreign affairs yeah three happy see tension rising camps starts come head i've decided make sure let supporters color views want biden i'd vote buttigeig pete either lite 
is anyone else disgusted people picked based ability energize different demographics believe not attack ezrs system general 
the problem ratio democratic picks republican point black americans overwhelmingly regard people vote that much higher obama also young 
this election cycle first one hispanic voters actually outnumber black https www nbcnews com news latino time latinos largest non white share eligible so castro could lot good energizing southwest possibly even helping flip texas 
but pick someone like abrams energize large base otherwise non voters hit polls battleground state

also really want event near boston i've seen candidates hometown senator 
you know fix problem reddit organizing tool dammit let use 
how choosing sanders vice unify party that actually tone deaf thing the conservative moderate popular democrat supporters also hostile warren lately believe 
it alienate moderates adore bernie vp would good strategy imo think get nomination wise warren see getting 
the idea something needs done unify party warren sanders ignoring progressive people lose minds social media left need get trivial differences want hope taking control actual 
gonna lie think ky state party better national party lol 
she professor think would well answering questions decades classroom 
oh boy probably full questions like favorite kind teepee 
what specifically fight ongoing russian aggression abroad home 
think protectionism much change manifesto makes general 
she often events southern nh drive around hour long 
get sentiment campaign digital organizing tool all in warren highly suggest use they least bit vetting less susceptible trolling info volunteer opportunities 
the reason i'd agree bernie warren makes sense vp high chance becoming president luxury selecting candidate pull particular demographic state building profile coming successor 
moderate rest shit dems general especially gun talk damn fine job alienating middle bernie like 
this post removed violating rule dividing democrats suggesting voting general ticket ideal part resulted trump 
know moderates biggest faction democratic party right lot studies suggest hilary unlikable candidate plus effect obama trump voters why biden winning huge margin states bernie previously there's theory supported like 
yep risk reward wrong an ama warren sub going change minds right direction 
you got point as much love ama would troll magnet maybe somebody like roger lau someone else working campaign could one 
although warren goddamn debate genius she'd probably respond something affordable housing native americans 
this understanding economists feel free correct as far tell ep plan trade exactly the creating incentives companies keep workers home fair treatment abroad even new standards multi national corporations still want foreign regions higher incentive compared china standard living bet supply demand equilibrium change prices goods relatively difference cut obscene corporate profits remember she'd also raise minimum wage hour you need protections existing jobs go next thing sudden increase worker cost that's eliminating student loan debt comes more spending money would offset small business afloat now there's another inflation while circulation increased deficit redistribution bank wealth move complex financial instruments savings loans federal reserve able manage incremental rate supposed but looking year road map look plans combined together individually saying economic risks less bernie's take account market behavior mmt dangerous believe warren better economics candidate 
although adopted bernie's policies really copycat candidate remember progressives tried draft warren anyone knew bernie similarly senate campaign post occupy wall street powered small donors similar fashion presidential run would fan followed campaigns and actually copied student loan debt forgiveness breaking big ag implementing wealth tax plan estate etc as far pulling republican swing votes https www independent co uk voices trump supporter elizabeth warren election vote html anecdotal evidence accepted people's relatives sub swayed like used youtube com watch tu yrbrt biggest midterms suburban women got sick trump 
agree warren pick vp help secure victory election like stacy abrams my thoughts bernie ticket probably fully thought though fair point mean loved think right choice lead democratic party currently and definitely 
literally came say stacey abrams wants seems like obvious choice vp really hoping warren secures nomination pick generic tim kaine white guy 
completely agree thoughts bernie warren think castro would great vp personally although abrams rad well 
quick look comment history demonstrates they're maga hat wearing dolphin fucker 
why choose sub though it's one compromised bots trolls that alone shows poor judgement 
stacy fucking abrams friends yes she really excellent 
lmao they're calling us delusional 
sfp banned guy donated hundreds bernie campaign said good thing warren big money general election they saying reach hilary supporters improve chances so get unfortunately i'm sure sub reddit represents character know real life but wotb seems much worse every time visit it's like userbase trump pretending maybe wrong really creeps 
wotb light moderation they censor users agree literally comment unless letter words auto removed major bernie supporter back election worse mods participate encourage attacking supporters like included with petty name calling including actively push seth rich conspiracy actively deny russia involvement hacking related last etc far better though perfect 
really miss old sanders president sub joined couple thousand people even announced intention run president it incredibly wholesome back 
wotb trump supporters likely russian military larping bernie years 
happened well got banned without explanation challenged factually wrong statements warren making clear also support bernie seems like even calls unity progressive movement considered kind traitorous if way bern light moderation mean tolerate lies counterspeech 
guess explains seems gone downhill lately is still good 
i'm sure good bernie sub reddit represents character supporters know real life ourpresident 
reddit front page ruins everything touches 
thanks fighting good fight anyway find bizarre anyone want unity progressive movement faith mean democracy majority rules need people get order anything done otherwise others said turns people's front judea vs judean two green parties etc

joy reid look people adore elizabeth warren seeking power

wish would shown adoration polls 
joy reid killing commentary primary her perspective knew biden would sweep south via black vote good she better get chris matthews spot 
this shes getting media coverage dropped time primary post iowa there three tickets woman earns one entire shows segments talking candidacy policies etc the erasure absolutely ridiculous contributed fall 
it's want convince warren supporters join candidate's team pathetic 
these honeyed words followed every single candidate drops the establishment welcoming diversity soon pose threat status quo 
spent lot time twitter pete dropped mike liz the sentiment saw different for it akin frightened person might lash threat gone like saying goodbye old friend one never much affection feel status quo could handle fact coming woman made even harder almost dare but supporters someone love miss dearly 
the sufferage never stopped wears different mask 
it's liz everything dems profess really 
know election going go bernie biden candidate win lose trump but think one essential truth take away primary years come elizabeth warren man th president united states 
wish media gave ew much attention 
it's crazy many supportive posts articles i've seen since dropped where people past years 
this true hope vp consideration 
women grasp let go pretty devastating damning statement joy reid 
so accurate get mommy issues vote women 
so much it's actually really gross almost like know exactly craven dislike warren when mattered one fight now might able help happy sing praises sadly many women surprised

joy get hardball slot she fantastic always speaks truth 
going post something along lines doesn't seem like today attention campaign gotten where october 
the right russia wants left fight stop letting win 
i'm big fan joy reid spot 
guy reaction may fair felt little victim blame 
this human nature nobody thought trump nazi epitome evil sought power well blowhard sure but lovable one he used welcome guest shows like snl late night circuit etc hell clintons even went wedding 
or media outlet actually mentioned name iowa 
yessssss thought thing maybe showed fight tough could actually influenced good it's easy say something afterwards 
it pete he got called racist corporate sellout quite boy pundits admiring grassroots movement douglass plan felt like lot good progressive voices time around ignored gone 
and media played role sexism it's like regretting nonetheless they never learn 
yep on thread wish bernie run gathered supporters around one progressive faction warren would easy path nomination right candidate working make moderate ideas better 
my husband knows woman work computer programmer pentagon even though fully admits sucked face ton sexism still adamant women right vote and men ones president oh divorced single mom since like early always talking hard even controlling anything the level internalized misogyny absolutely mind blowing 
think voters terrified happened nightmares might happen internalized may outcome nominee female wrong message interpret clintons loss imo as result want pick 'safe' option 
https www mcsweeneys net articles dont hate women candidates hated hillary clinton believe elizabeth warren responsible collapse republic 
it always excuses there silly disqualifier small reasons justify holding women standard twice high men you ever convince biden electable qualified warren 
i'd vote woman that that always bullshit hillary far qualified person president 
that need ignore argue wrong vote woman we several qualified women run year whether moderate progressive and yet someone said candidate plus got slammed they use hold different impossible standard male candidates it ok clearly country voting added years 
the thing hillary checked boxes many people went nah 
well elizabeth ever consider being woman check mate 
stand primary vote clinton right country absentee warren absolutely 
feel like warren could contender bernie even said ran 
several women age warren said things last year like women leaders one woman you know organization trouble hire run afraid generational issue take another years change enough voters even consider it shocks still much 
as male warren backer crushed nominee unless something miraculous happens truth statement there also realizing women voting block groups born tell little us choose say much think kind person we continue fight past sexism racism homophobia negative things midst progressive agenda white house every strong competent leader shares values ayana pressley julian castro blood teeth 
damn sub went get ew elected fuck patriarchy overnight 
liz weaknesses plenty competition ofc uphill climb gender think could done attacked left right entire primary if bernie run half moderates also dont race basically biden warren start even sexism today i'm convinced wins 
the hillary treatment fox news trying aoc trying pack much lies asap know rise power sooner they're especially worried since wields platform social media lot better expected 
warren political outsider trying inch way inside that's night day compared hilary career insider if looking solve puzzle start paid dues dnc propelled forward many banking executives ew going major campaign contributors meanwhile hillary quite cozy husband repealed glass steagall 
think snake mudslinging hurt lot well alongside trump little pet name oh god he's already prepared clearly can't win felt like media female bernie ignored 
very well could also critique campaign extent the medicare all debacle objectively hurt especially bernie admitting taxes would go it coincidence surged liz faltered moment politically tried bridge two groups democrats together think super tuesday showing party fractured 
you might like book https www wikiwand com en herland novel

see point think realist if women demand woman president men certainly going 
idk downvoted that's exactly reid end she said voting women responsible nominating woman means i'm want enough way black voters wanted president it's pretty fucking infuriating even every voter voted obama gotten without non math going divided parties meaning can't count republicans independents vote nominee bank democratic order make happen and look men say where fuck women rallying around candidates long time needs change us media pundits supporters sexist 
oh obvious berners reaching realized revolution short thousands votes due non existent constituency need us both remaining candidates weaknesses suggest sanders lifelong career questionable judgement going picked naive cult think side 
unfortunately flies face several bernie's supporters surrogates said done formula get whipped froth refuse vote much closer 's biden's current messaging party unity focusing defeating trump instead democrats 
no proved evil 'mexicans rapist' nonsense mocking disabled reporter reading muslim ban campaign etc he horrible person still 
this at first agreed woman video thinking women stopped warren also men preferring candidates even warren's message matched wanted husband example fell media vilifying well entire system set voting akin electoral college popular vote every state voted yet while able sc still living wisconsin would the primary flawed archaic post trump political landscape need overhauled otherwise end second term kids following afterwards 
really care pete one way think treatment comparable especially talking take elect woman give voice weight deserves process opinion taken far seriously embarrassingly limited experience merited as amy pointed slim resume would never seen legitimate contender presidency going argue progressivism lack thereof done death but benefited male privilege start campaign end and taking conversation plight candidate making golden boy get fair shake obnoxious 
think pete progressive voice this video https youtu dmmob wmmlo definitely speaks specific kind audience nevertheless good job pointing problematic aspects buttigeig's stances issues including douglass plan mentioned 
maybe would gotten positive coverage douglas plan try fake black endorsements also pete ignored the reason nearly nh iowa got shit ton media before primary actually started millions dollars free attention more kamala booker gillibrand he young former mayor college town yet press experienced minority female candidates think fair put situation warren agree progressive people internet claimed mainly said republican 
the level internalized misogyny women absolutely mind blowing yeah it's phenomenon systems oppression oppressed reinforce 
yep admin previous job woman think women 'brains' use vote right my hope wait long enough people die stupid opinions it's depressing 
this republicans first female president the women capture voters need boot neck that's something modern trump conservatives mostly get behind 
wow think i'm feminist lot women that's weird interesting point made cornell philosophy professor kate manne misogyny rewards reinforce status quo punishes 
i'm curious know reasoning behind beliefs 
also think liz's path nomination top bernie sanders the left strong enough could competitive saw surge different times take progressive mantle ended lot luckier timing peak warren summer happened iowa warren's positions would reversed 
southern dems view job pick someone think win general election they take primary seriously you get powerful combination sexism older traditional cohort plus fear everybody elses then happened south tuesday result 
its like seriously elizabeth warren man think better everyone else means would vote voting purely rational decision obviously impossible convince anyone disassociate gender perception concept even people might stubborn admit bias sexism lets also pretend like part making process 
the relentless freak plans day sign 
knowing warren boogieman keeps coulter night sarcophagus chef's kiss 
as terrible coulter imagine even work harder every man come across career get so clearly veiled nod warren verbal slap back head democratic voters still failing see best candidate stage one that's debater prepared shouts least 
this exactly liz pitch lol we end times but truly worry bernie win nothing seen suggests huge interest work governing leveraging position enact structural change ask first days mentions rallies it like sees election point fails deliver especially second term unlikely progressivism dead water generation 
reminded rush limbaugh rambling tirade liberals okay aaaaanything comes sex long consent like yeah where think burn man 
exactly would hope fellow yanggangers see data driven solutions oriented remaining candidates 
she real life leslie knope 
they really party feckless ineptitude at least ann's upfront think need new sticker go along nevertheless persisted says she's freak 
accidentally gave best reason warren candidate thanks ann coulter never thought i'd say that sentence loud mean 
are tweets copyrighted cause needs campaign merch 
waiting liz replay scene simpsons movie presenting plans time president congress whatever 
if nazi barbie hates love 
absolutely who knew ann coulter would 'endorse' elizabeth warren bring plans 
this far best endorsement i've seen liz 
the condition warren part sanders admin candidate makes bernie viable imo love feel outclasses 
and love give government works hard citizens 
lmao oh y'all ann coulter us 
don't threaten good time ann 
ann coulter hilarious years kinda sorry see material 
anything coming woman's crazy mouth worth spit 
lol reminds rubio's comment obama knows he's 
always ignore republicans opinions democratic primary they never arguing good faith 
warren could make great president america deserves and doesnt get nomination hope gets vp least would better mind helm 
in ann coultiers mind yes anything resembling reality no 
mean comparison rn suppose this truly bizarro timeline 
given insane current administration uselessness vile policy yes 
knowing ann coulter sure views strategic tweet split progressive vote 
huge part conservative ideology traditional conservatism shift absolute faith single figurehead today stems notion progressive policy bankrupt nation for insignificant portion base fear liberal destroying economy primary reason looking past less attractive aspects conservative leaders get probably believe also cognizant fragility belief they understand scenario however likely president could enact survives if country completely fall apart government major pillar 
basically conservatives want government absolutely nothing start unnecessary wars protect wealthy 
well got brilliant new user name needed one sub 
no i'm pretty sure veiled endorsement well knows gives shit ann ghoulter 
bet bitch even knows cite claims mla apa chicago style without looking purdue owl first rush limbaugh march 
her bloomberg big self endorsement could ask 
as terrible coulter imagine even work harder every man come across career get it telling refers liz sen warren one bernie 
he interview cnn debate repeated something he's said stuck asked he'd pass progressive stuff congress basically different kind president go hold rallies issues around country kentucky minimum wage would somehow convicne mcconnell paul vote bills it's nice think theory laughably naive practical governing plan sure maybe could work democrats it'll effect red states republicans and willing get rid filibuster state veto entire legislative agenda sanders simply realistic deliver anything supports pressed supporters duck dodge say believer warren detailed plans wants kill can't things already laid eos she's compromise needed mainly focuses dream big starting position very much better like 
yep being president repeating stump speech ad infinitum 
he much opposition too alienating sure brings youth vote old people shun way reliable voters progressives moderates independents conservatives terrified socialism https news gallup com poll atheism political liabilities aspx see net negative overall trump republicans anxiously waiting unleash torrent ads solidifying socialist amount liberal latino enthusiasm going overcome 
i'm pretty sure bernie lose trump tbh lot voters going pick scary revolutionary socialist exactly gop stealth russian intelligence successfully paint general he much baggage overcome eyes swing 
another example conservatives threatening us with good time 
maybe rush offended anything much consent part 
warren got poll bump hate fic ex marine 
heard described policy wonk love flair shirt something 
can get rights play super freak next rally please 
if anne supports something wrong 
i'm sure ann coulter would love see trump run bernie 
good catch try really hard perpetuate historical conditioning seeing politics team vs anyone participated form competition recognize position respecting move skill opponent displayed without overtly cheering think one moments 
warren needs call bs like actually say debate stage mcconnell pass hold rally kentucky expose naive best unqualified job worst if win liz would work guaranteed 
the whole rally thing creeps fuck care head there's got productive use time leading election specific frame understand outside gross 
he said he'd go kentucky hold rallies minimum wage stuff would somehow convicne mcconnell paul vote bills if truly plan warren call the turtle libertarian care nothing constituents they'd laugh bernie's tactics probably already really wants win push plans eos contrast ridiculous rally strategy bernie defeats trump we'll four years gridlock old man yelling pretty much without overt fascism take battle now 
the first time heard say really astonished thing bernie things political calculus mind lot people admire he must believe actually work yikes 
of course thinks rallies solve everything like trump part job wants 
even though i'm bernie stan would've expected building local coalitions relying rallies he's truly movement rallies get butts seats real change comes organzing supporting groups involve people dedicated issues 
sure maybe could work democrats it'll effect red states republicans i'd imagine sees huey long teddy roosevelt situation sets bully pulpit expects supporters harass targets submission it sounds silly realize cult personality arisen around sanders really demagogue rules 'iron fist' 
those rallies indeed part plan though warren's accounts building public support also inside bernie warren sanders ticket need vp cause would time drum leaving president set blocks washington 
yeah hate agree pete anti trump wave ride swing house districts suburbia my hope hatred strong vote anyone even bernie 
trump supports seriously sent tweet telling bernie good luck em boy at least he's got going 
younger voters tend bernie bust say show vote gets nom they showing primaries big numbers yet sure really believe older people never now maybe they'll come around doubt five months commie death panels attack ads whatever going motivate i've heard year old men could first election sit 
feel like two kinds people primary live leftist bubble think takes calmly talk democratic socialist issues win rest us understand easy gop help russian intelligence turn bernie toxic revolutionary extremist eyes voters need actually election 
yep think loses and house put weird cervical cancer essays rotation houses suburban white women swung months tbh going incredibly difficult anyone given electoral college unless recession risky then biden also high risk he sharp 
people really mouth breathers want loudest rhetoric 
do listen podcast knowledge fight that call supporters makes laugh see expression wild 
maybe rick james history women work warren's vibe 
and there's good chance nazi 
how much bernie sanders gets done entirely dependent hard work flip senate continue involved elections doesn't matter warren republican pass legislation clear 
to real entire gop believe luck right nominating bernie would tantamount gift wrapping election handing trump 
maybe trying boost bernie profile case think wants brokered convention would leave many democrats salty possible edit lol guys downvoting probably right ann coulter intention pitting silly 
one non shitshow parts last night's debate warren less making exact point health care plan actually done work make viable gets office much 
she would work sanders taking credit 
worry late the time months ago people started voting 
it trump he never stopped campaigning 
unquestioning adulation apparently hell drug 
think idea fight policies want going stop winning election at point need convince congress senate even super majority getting anything passed hard potential repeat happened affordable care act rallies show force effective way move people ladder engagement political movements volunteers donors make case when meet real space listen support politician discuss movement chances interconnected our live die strength cohesion organization groups populate good sew network together stronger fabric 
when next debate anyway looking new texas poll think strategy bomb bloomberg leave bernie mostly alone seems pushing viability line understands momentum want create if still alive super tuesday take eta she also highest net favorability good margin the electability issue really poison everyone likes willing stick necks 
think he's totally honest says believes get many people come polls really political revolution the problem plan happens gets elected occur size needed actually remove like mcconnell power 
like base supporters every single major city baffles talk involve presidency he's president people 
fan warren amy ticket klobuchar moderate senate democrat really think could unite everyone left career republicans especially see romney bloc form essentially override mcconnell republican create progressive agenda tons support disclaimer bernie open spirited debate 
imo bernie anywhere ticket electoral suicide we lose house probably senate seats 
pete absolutely money loathe admit bernie theory path electoral college victory bunk it would rely huge youth turnout likes never seen primary showing he winning split field picking momentum people jump bandwagon anointed winner but needs educated white boomers poorly demos and conceded florida start 
trump wants bernie win nomination gives best chance reelection so russia reasons gross 
keep asking why whole host competent likeable good candidates not warren castro booker harris that ending sanders biden god forbid bloomberg believe backlash trump risk woman poc seem willing guy trouble finishing sentences socialist mountain baggage because white men if we'd known earlier maybe jay inslee could pressured stop talking climate change go serious candidate he's governor and progressive without able finish 
disagree considering senate democrats endorsed plans strongly doubt bernie gets anything done even flip every seat that's cycle warren actual history getting moderate dems support progressive ideas think sanders presidency second jimmy carter still prefer mile 
clarifying tweet said responding undercover defense promotion bernie supporters sub their tactics include trying mitigate deflect even mildest criticism sanders stealth way in times crisis warren history making huge improbable progressive change eg dreaming organizing fighting building whole new federal agency active check financial institution fraud she fight republicans democrats make happen accomplished anything near comparable scope scale your unsupported still wish promote candidate subs edited add context https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments bnwm seeing lot bernie voices saying gets fiqnzfe 
maybe that's people said gop nominating trump 
is gut tells because polls tell difference story imagine goal pit democrats 
god last night mess it good opener want specifically point absurdity running promise pass ambitious piece progressive legislation since new deal protesting outside mitch mcconnell bedroom window kentucky 
you come queen best miss 
and elizabeth warren warning housing crisis years happened she pretty good track record pointing things 
this delicious irony terrifying truth 
it's even prediction there's republican white house of course recession 
oh lookie collection dums mock https americarisingpac org elizabeth warrens politically motivated recession warning long fear shorts facts 
at never excited political candidate let 
trump got extremely lucky inherit obama economy when democrat wins suffering stupid people blame new president 
shouldnt invest stock market right 
gonna get super shitty cause that'd pleasant timing inevitable want fuck republicans shit 
she right first time fact establishment prepared doubted hopefully make mistake face financial crisis 
guess good thing skip important context huh jeff 
warren sober person party warning people drive get mad bringing vibe 
it almost professor one country leading experts precise subject 
yeah i'm pretty sure warren knows read fucking yield curve 
the housing crisis lot signs build slower 
literally one good track record predicting financial market downturns 
that works recessions part business cycle hyman minsky done quite lot work subject interest understanding recessions occur what tax cuts like one gwb prolong recovery ideally cut income taxes boost spending when revenue economy strong weaken ability actually need this exacerbated low rates cannot much next recession hits two best responses weakened gop the cause platform since late absolutely prolongs 
like elizabeth longest bull run history country it's bound end regardless office if anything he's artificially extended tax cuts pressure fed keep interest rates low 
don't try catch falling knife dollar cost average always 
might want wait see market bottoms more bang buck situation 
you always short buy option puts 
probably talk financial advisor https www investopedia com articles recession asp historically one safer places equity market consumer staples these typically last products household removes budget 
and next kid dies driving home they'll act like totally control nothing could done 
the funniest shit i've seen twitter warren copies clinton harris as decades credentials 
some recessions cyclical can't say every recession natural feel like lot horrible republican economic policy warren saying avoidable sure part economy good regulation place prevent least worst parts think blame falls trump's shoulders especially bad trade war 
more accurately blowing cash tax cuts jack stimulate economy left keynesian toolbox half empty coming recession 
know federal deficit skyrocketing trump chinese trade war offsets point interest cut 
what jorts i've got wranglers rip knee 
no post it appears recession fears overblown 
know hear people saying copies harris clinton she's pretty far left mostly uses bernie's ideas think bullshit just running president last year platform mean fighting lot policies years 
recessions man made did cycle start trade war china remove nafta give tax cuts rich cut social services everyone else emergency funds natural disasters build wall cause hiring freeze government 
for equities markets none things mentioned seem large factor tax cuts spurred corporate acquisitions stock buy backs boosting continued expansion our cared deficit long time would start caring trump office hasn't growing year almost decades obama tripled first even doubled since taking the trade war policy warren likely continue becomes president it's one policies great deal strategic importance associated 
shorting jorts bad strategy financially general unfortunately rising popularity 
steve eisman shorting canadian banks lots investors retailers depend chinese imports food exporters china taking hit so would bet american economy stock 
she's liberal progressive bernie democratic socialist her policies reflect the thing they're identical medicare for all example warren's student loan forgiveness cover top bernie's warren also better way pay solution https www youtube com watch cdduzk clinton harris moderate she pretty much nothing common either however appeal base kinda weird given policy differences would vote someone exact opposite that's attacking they're different voters and character important 
it's cycle insomuch republicans get power immediately start cutting checks expense middle working class as baron rothschild said buy there's blood streets even if design somehow keep lucking gobbling wealth everyone else wiped 
obama triple debt the tripled office when say placing blame increase factually speaking almost due congress control spending taxation specifically three largest sources iraq afghan wars tax cuts gwb voted none opposed making permanent national politics war thus blaming rather inaccurate best policies responsible slightly less eight years rest largely administration previous congressional decisions for someone seems understand finance seem good grasp basics government handles money history 
you wrong number things deficits spiked went every single year obama second trump may extended equity bubble stopped end to spent crazy amount money causing deficits spike brief growth returned levels are really better much higher debt load new 
shorting professional investors tolerate risk infinite losses no one reddit advice level investing engage shorts not ever 
you even know difference debt said deficit go look research stats nearly everything totally wrong 
you wrong number things deficits spiked went every single year obama first never said deficits didnt decrease tripling first secondly deficit increased edit wait dont know i'm giving credit the also well lol second trump may extended equity bubble stopped end uh lol idea talking we're time highs to spent crazy amount money causing spike brief growth returned levels are really better much higher debt load new what even spending increase military budget component tax cuts we're obama markets significantly growth rates measured percentage easier grow trough recession peak economic recovery people literally economically illiterate 
know difference missed somehow tripling deficit still done congress approve spending tarp almost universally well regarded among economists worked profitable as fir statements regarding debt parts government spend money true obama responsible creating increases deficits potus including trump budgets spends means responsibility fault you would hard pressed find valid source suggest otherwise furthermore suggesting choice increase face crash ridiculous we could let system collapse without causing even worse problems here tip see anyone blaming president taxation remember fall purview white house propose things ultimately decides happen 
said growth returned obama levels as gdp you confusing equity markets equities shot trump gave companies trillions used buy back shares it squat economy 
ok everything said literally invalidates criticism responding trump you're making point 
wow saying growth immediately worst recession almost years equal rates peak longest expansion american history accomplishment 
no claimed almost everything said true claiming obama tripled deficit first year moronic part much spending occurred furthermore congress spent money the thing seems correct market largely ignore deficits 
no comparing growth end obama term why google gdp chart tell trump spike 
ok congress spent money trumps fault deficit increased 
literally everything saying wrong gdp growth obama's last two years trumps first late cycle expansion not apples oranges obama incredibly easier starting position even standards increases larger

she still younger biden sanders if one term that candidates currently including gabbard since nonfactor dot com 
she biden one termer scenario runs gets dnc nom clearly best choice back send joe pasture he'll jan wins we run un precedented write campaign get added candidate fl nh etc says oh crap we're going lose states make then force whoever nomination step put that's kind trump he threatened the evan mcmullin plan not enough win hey another former ma senator exactly years became president without winning electoral college in order work would mcmullin's ut hope clinton reach house choose necessary state delegations see amendment xii dems convince better legislative gubernatorial elections year though next redistricting maps frequently red bloody democracy shed republicans carving country 
recall suppose knew like bernie hillary presumptive nominee 
including gabbard since nonfactor dot com really running race present 
with healthcare i'd happy call president 
borrowing nonfactor dot com thanks 
tell organizations truly trying non biased fact wether even acknowledge tulsi still exists 
mcmullin's plan win ut hope clinton trump reach house would choose several family members voted mcmullin think would've received quite lot votes people picked rumor mom gay maybe he's definite vibe made unsafe hillary well established minion satan that's utah even though everyone purported hate they've changed minds forgiven republicans fun state live mean absolutely insane politically many ways 
not genuinely want president she felt someone ought experience first 
theory running fox news position 
mean yang got cnn unbelievable 
mean cnn practically fox news anyway there much difference neoliberal propaganda machine like republican outlet at least honest we knew yang and warren surprised going back helping establishment watch people die know nancy pelosi secretly alien

he feeding tax dollars aliens area 
new joebiden's campaign confirms reviewed ewarren bankruptcy plan closely endorsing proposal said il town hall 
from tweet joebiden's campaign confirms reviewed ewarren bankruptcy plan closely endorsing proposal said il town hall that's significant shift would largely undo bill two clashed congress 
obama adopted warren's proposals next best thing warren wh ideas 
forgot mention there's petition going get biden add warren's plans platform https sign moveon org petitions letter vice president biden please 
post think warren becomes influential senator america biden wins meant jab needs senate can imagine majority leader 
yay happening this great see really appreciate know kamala going vp got hopes biden warren ticket 
and this leverage push progressive policy likely winner exactly want lose endorsing guy pragmatics get stuff done 
for reference warren's plan bankruptcy reform https elizabethwarren com plans 
further proof progress happens hard work unity rather vitriol divisiveness 
nice i'm team joe days read writing wall hoping finds way embracing least warren's politics so nice see 
leverage work ew never sleeps 
great first step next climate change anticorruption wealth tax immigration oh hey stick ticket 
the dems need work together get shit done 
keeping biden warren dreams alive 
boom suspect negotiations going warren getting policy concessions it's good thing folks 
here's hoping wins calls one term warren best chance true progressive who's completely top stuff for awesome see 
would guys want warren vp good idea i'd absolutely support 
neoliberal user someone shared us this moderates progressives get along 
to left withhold endorsement till moves 
i'm sure elizabeth warren would love nothing joe biden incorporate plans platform curious see it'll come fruition 
lmaoo bernie supporters insisted able change mind policy if budge sure warren would make eloquent pragmatic case all adopt platform 
think really like biden afraid adopt proposals he said speech bridge future truly believe means going use presidency building next political generation stubborn answers 
this promising move know organic choice something warren negotiated requirement endorsement suspect latter since used leverage hillary leftward year even influential joe set widen delegate lead dramatically next batch states surprised find endorsing afterwards originally thought she'd hold april th primaries coronavirus crisis full swing think we're going see lot incentive unify sooner rather later 
that is big hoped something like would happen liz stay long enough clear going fly short get policies ideas conversation 
dunno maybe feels less beholden banks he's longer de's senator 
we hold feet fire he every reason endorse right make absurdly low priority president 
proposal would largely undo bankruptcy bill two clashed congress this highlights best worst biden presidency he responds incentive sometimes little well 
hey open letter bunch warren volunteer leaders created asking you read https medium com dreambigfighton vice president biden eecd fe sign feel inclined think places policy lacking plans would perfect 
wont nominee least plans done ill happy 
done already keep bringing people's attention thanks 
imaging warren pelosi wonder twins powers activate sequence 
this fight think win the senate can't stand tenure rewards longest excludes women poc 
thought warren pelosi similar levels attention detail tenacity boldness 
yeah know full well harris really think warren much better prospect generating enthusiasm among grassroots progressives suburban women going need 
kamala good though and warren other's back so see liz partnering together get things done 
i'd surprised pick someone midwest since going important states california lock 
kamala chance relatively high one thing would fail bring red states wish val demings little gov experience cause super impressive 
kamala disappointing choice whenever anyone criticizes resorts proud done speech wasn main person attacking biden debates 
thanks link reading i'm little disappointed addressing personal chapter commercial entities use structure liquidation spins assets harms creditors others also think trustees ought standing debt collection claims even allow us bring class action they'll likely resources individual though debtor still see benefit 
this also like seeing take couple days getting back work she still influential senator could senate majority leader 
sanders ways hurt progressive left within democratic party giving people idea aggressively run institution and meant establishment sellout instead like warren pramilla jayapal katie porter ed markey i'd argue even aoc extent shown far ability actually drive change understanding need work party 
ding ding winner chicken dinner 
it's also worth noting biden without warren's endorsement campaign he's proving warren effective pushing left latching bernie's dead trying delay inevitable 
i'm rooting joe think drive turnout among older democrats much better bernie and voters enormous block if can't win support he's got shot 
see lot would useless degree agree think could influence realize found article interesting enlightening https nymag com intelligencer inside race win elizabeth warren html particularly part as clinton approached presidency considered warren potential running mate senator made plans shape new administration appointments drawing lists recommended hires unacceptable nominees if one thing mattered team insisted able white house policy often said personnel 
wavering difficult argue woc ticket nomination owed black voters yeah disaffected younger going read platform months decide volunteer adopted bankruptcy plans may yet go back wins the vp visible concession make 
want adopt warren's electoral voting reform plan next https medium com teamwarren strengthen democracy ec bcd federal elections get state art federal machines ballots security right jurisdictions use dated easily hackable paper trail ballot design place no the government replace every machine country equipment require adoption uniform ballot and lock technology systems behind firewall like fort knox standards we election running problems resources malfeasance errors rampant ensure everyone vote including mandating automatic day registration early mail my mean arbitrary voter purges issues gerrymandering also make election day holiday easier people polls enforce law expand access incentives possible authority necessary give states cutting edge protocols paid required follow states choose meet requirements work partnership agreements fully funded bonus achieving high turnout rates racist corrupt politicians refuse temporarily take administration guarantee fundamental right 
next climate change biden already supports green new deal https joebiden com 
think biden probably already pro immigration reform open appointing attorney general whose mandate anti corruption criminal justice i'm hoping preet bharara the wealth tax know maybe warren push congress put spot it adopted hugely popular voters across political spectrum 
makes sense senator representing state one bank corporate friendly states country now years vp experience obama administration citizen trump wouldn surprise adjusted views betterment nation rather simply 
this thought well delaware catering corporations since place almost major incorporate favorable laws left get biden malleable issues frozen time he still deeply flawed everything want anyone concessions warren suspect campaign talks negotiating take endorse bernie's should i'm doubtful 
good point de one largest tax havens world needs serious rewrite many financial laws 
idk man still funded banks right think probably elizabeth warren perfect person job needs olive branch progressives 
mid election hint proposal versus actual bill voted the banks still fueling campaign 
i'd go ideas outdated wants president 
someone responds incentive means least influence able 
warren times bold pelosi liz called biggest changes country half century in nancy's speakerships rhetorically theatrically strong constantly caves gop policy this week's paid sick leave bill prime example 
imagine harris warren practicing vp debates together harris's cut man mike pence get bloomed and already take downs 
could kamala also short list https www usatoday com story news politics elections joe biden possible vice president stacey abrams sally yates gave back november sally yates stacey abrams jeanne shaheen maggie hassan of would fit clyburn cbc suggestion but get feeling whether liz others old reasons pick someone disappointed know unicorn seeing 
highly doubt majority leader that ever question seniority schumer durbin next line said majority minority leader whip incredibly influential better liberal lion massachusetts one currently holding ted kennedy's old seat 
know she'd convince majority caucus back maybe current senators progressive most average liberals center left moderates think candidates we're relying flip senate also liberal moderate kelly bullock hickenlooper etc lefty progressives 
sanders everything well balance tremendous help progressive left he's great moral leader political he articulated argument progressivism degree generations necessary gaining public support policies you're right we're going look toward politicians actually become dominant force within party reason list bernie sanders's personal flaws wake two runs number congress members soared candidates began running office every level among voters galvanized online grassroots fundraising proved viable way fund post citizens united presidential campaign tent got bigger inroads politically neglected dormant communities across country including native american muslim latino that's lasting impact progressives the base ballgame open primary capitalize gains 
honestly believe true https joebiden com climate biden believes green new deal crucial framework meeting challenges face it powerfully captures two basic truths core plan united states urgently needs embrace greater ambition epic scale meet scope challenge environment economy completely totally connected 
at least biden supports paris climate accord big improvement trump 
exactly as climate first voter shifting biden warren dropped brainer 
removed sorry allow form bernie bros per rule if want edit comment reply reapprove thanks 
and biden helps ticket races important take back senate maintain increase numbers house also state legislatures governorships much hope mainly well performed michigan showing obama coalition working class white men extent going show vote 
after liz got vetted vp slot one clinton senior advisors told crystal ball could tell pain ass years would ticket help general weakness left flank hillary went loyalty virginia instead well saw happened hope biden took notes and managed torpedo odious larry summer lifelong dream running fed senate floor despite obama mainstay imagine able something personnel position 
she would useful pretty much lock nomination assuming biden one term i'm totally board vp warren train 
yup saying things fine extremely large trust issue the best way prove bluffing suspect moment put actual progressive believes ideals heartbeat presidency 
i'm warren supporter as much i'd love see ticket important stay senate replaced republican tammy baldwin vp could good pick 
hoping stacey abrams ag actually really want see well qualified deserves place administration given invaluable work fair fight 
the financial crisis changed way lot people look sector think joe biden one 
sure bernies campaign reached asked endorsement think liz kinda already knew thought gonna win wanna hitch trailer wrong horse 
bernie hillary right convention order produce most progressive agenda administration something warren worked since so possible hopefully earlier 
apart first debate harris oddly disappointing debates she allowed exposed fricking tulsi it strange prepared defend ag record know coming but takedowns sessions kavanaugh show definitely got maybe needed smaller field shine 
nope ideal pick progressive woc swing state risk senate seat enough experience job day also proven campaigner debater this person exist becomes question priorities 
it set stone yet clyburn cbc publicly called black woman going difficult go another direction kamala hinted hard recent talk joe team also social media the major democratic donors funding general like particularly liz obvious reasons gave tv interview last week said wants vp aligned issues way see changing mind internal numbers convince generational gap would hurt badly november remedy progressive economy collapses soon needs 
think detailed enough get policy want someone progressive something across line passed 
he help perhaps in held movement back broke apart his shitty campaign culture split progressives alienated warren factional strategy predicated hostile takeover crowded flopped the uncompromising nature prevented growing also made anyone wanted compromise gradual theory sustainable change seem like neoliberal right wing sellout whatever 
what actually helped be specific 
i'm dick cheney left she even blasted rich guy face already 
this definitely good first step also reads signal bernie drop already liz hurry endorse hope holds longer at least get anti corruption plans and disability plan know really proud one biden even if pick progressive hard read shift left posturing going need enthusiasm fall fear trump might line anyway rather risk 
but replaced republican there chance hell seat flips it literally tammy baldwin hand could well flip wisconsin turn red stay including senate seats ex ron johnson 
baldwin duckworth klobuchar abrams seem like likely choices someone help make gains midwest open south bit i'd rather see liz treasury secretary 
elizabeth warren positive message shoring support whoever democratic nominee supporters promise saying higher candidate 
i'm volunteer texter one text leaders suggested say thanks active voter we've reached natural conclusion convo someone different preferred candidate love closing message 
some reddit call weakness think proof running good campaign free mudslinging disingenuous attacks we may different order would vote warren us know end goal beating trump 
this love warren she's able balance big structural change tm pragmatism ethos trickles supporters 
here data grabbed formatted part poll referenced title post emerson college polling jan https emersonpolling reportablenews com pr national biden sanders battle two way race democratic nomination will vote democratic nominee even candidate supporters supporter's st choice candidate yes no depends warren biden buttigieg bloomberg sanders yang additionally detailed breakdown theoretical match ups vs trump would cause voter blocks imgur gallery lebrvwj note weirdos like supporter says instead 
if ranked choice voting nationwide i'm pretty sure she'd win nomination feel like everyone's second worse 
firmly believe would best leader country moment exactly reason among others 
love think much elizabeth style refusal damage party hope heart wins important in spirit positivity using site actual headline distinction to leading candidate supporters loyal nominee dangerous sign bernie overwhelmingly positive supporting wish surrogates enforce echo chamber threatens future win vowing vote shameful 
i'm caucusing warren iowa monday i'll vote potato general got carved 
while results vary lot depending polls think numbers change primary good 
supporters promise support nominee saying higher candidate at least regard sounds like warren leading example hopefully keep 
this awesome tho take note pete supporters also 
hate supporters candidate allow another four years trump we page 
very cool proud berners https np reddit com wayofthebern comments eu bernie bust strong scaring sort confidence 
dropping say hell yeah i'm gonna vote dem nominee 
yet rabid wing sanders supporters seem attack anyone they really paint bad image bernie 
i'm bernie supporter really appreciate warren's campaign supporters she's definitely nd choice 
this make sense good thing doesn't mean warren anyone else least capable bringing non voters disenchanted trump supporters 
it's time biden supporters say 'blue matter who' put shut one way progressive going win race 
aren guys playing win this positive 
so values you want right colored team win regardless actually office mean sure politics maybe strive something specific happen stopping bad guy 
only reddit ability raise diverse coalition negative thing 
and getting warren plans enacted regardless potus 
not beating trump big structural change 
agreed when volunteering iowa summer everyone polk county positive genuinely meant go drinks times peoples guards still ever heard polite criticisms candidates great respect willingness vote every one from elizabeth campaign directors organisers volunteers voters positivity spreads 
absolutely the point always articulate tone top central theme book enron scandal smartest men room it's idea however leadership presents morally ethically percolate way organization absolutely true warren embodiment best fantastic read encourage everyone take time 
more like supporters ethos flocking warren she's answering need supplying motivation we discovered pragmatism we've found truly pragmatic progressive candidate that powerful rallying force 
apart yes sanders whopping no yang makes sad 
thank on mobile actually yang genuinely quite upsetting suppose attracted republican support it arguably lot less important despite higher though since supporters still bit bernie essentially bleed primary voters without including depends see even half voting biden we need coordinated push entire campaigns vote blue matter candidates 
the sanders situation good example issues zealous support base keep reading bernie win nomination that's evidence need know rigged it's exact language faulty logic binary thinking heard trump supporters back looked like going lose election intend disparage moved supported nominee lingered conspiracy resentment idea past four years administration supporter dnc candidate could consider sitting ludicrous hell nominated mitt romney jeb bush i'd put lawn sign point national referendum whether want remain constitutional republic least favored winning secondary concern 
it seems lot yang people actually trumpets conservatives really sure supporters 
https morningconsult com democratic primary is though maybe sanders supporters the rest 
know she would need enough buttigieg yang klobachar bloomberg voters put high surpass sanders going current average points there currently shared see least half going biden so warren get votes rest still percent either committed supporting even minor candidate could break way but guaranteed ignore sitting sanders support including top rounding wanted highlight quite lots redistributed the thing preferential voting really help second choice among candidates popular first preference which bad necessarily mean libertarians win basically every election one gets otherwise 
one occasion supporters essentially try extort support arguing straight face anyone else's would vote whoever wins might want trump win sanders primary literally told supporting equivalent it disgusting infuriating imagine something hear but think that's happens strong leadership top messaging coupled near vilification competition 
you know primarily sanders supporter though warren clear think people likely break pissed status quo unhappy ethics dnc behaved may make statements frustration warning party elites however back supporters broke clinton could higher compare less obama going mccain vs trump actually better recent history imagine numbers would look different time all said polled praised attitude work foster candidates including fellow 
it's sort ironic though biden supporters constantly argue appeals conservative democrats would never vote bernie use reason support his voters therefore best chance beat trump and received establishment legitimate biden's nomination but reported nominee everyone jumps despicable people real etc using logic fans actually strong that if important goal ultimately defeat 
potatoes done anything anyone except exist feed us get fermented give vodka love except time problematic ancestors i'll admit potato reason every american trump abducted aliens 
canvasing nh warren past weekend people pete top consideration seemed friendly open ideas aside supporters favorite talk 
honestly never seen sub honestly terrifying proud wasting day writing candidate running win 
holy shit sub terrifying turned blue 
my biggest turnoff bernie far psychotic supporters it's scary love pieces wish he'd try little harder reign extremists 
he independent surprise appeals wide arrange voters independents vote candidate party this surprising scary

not sure downvoted asking question all means supporters committed nominee it necessarily mean bringing new voters quite contrary according polls diving recently trump whoever primary wise fight lot policies favoured independents republicans need remember greater name recognition bernie biden pull among republicans independents factions follow detailed policy democratic primaries know surface info like warren liberal elite massachusetts once learn really comes fighting doubt gain support 
what primary voting even started 
this perfect example react not every candidate win primary fostering die intense support good exclusive selfish endangering fight beat trump keep percentage two it promote proud elizabeth 
sure worry they good friends knew going enter race know business there strong chance gets picked veep wins he researching whether give top cabinet position vice presidency still immense respect 
see coming values elizabeth aligns far closely followed bernie go policies weirdly steyer as keep saying though benefit warren minuscule danger general huge every candidate support numbers like not sure difficult grasp want win badly spent two months life volunteering days week end that mean condone risking leaving trans minority americans discriminated disenfranchised abortion rights peril another conservative justice supreme court give tiny extra edge primary 
well considering lot saying unless progressive socialist really republican so 
the smartest guys room movie version well done 
otoh looks like may long fight as less popular candidates drop benefit warren she continue accumulate delegates well positioned convention win https fivethirtyeight com features election update warren sanders help warrens chances iowa put winning takes iowa followed buttigieg sanders biden finishing fourth second best case drops of course trump chance night nothing candidate far need keep accumulating person race think strong position 
honestly think bernie reached ceiling where else go literally every candidate's second choice liz sans yang iirc needs get hump augmented post threshold count see race stands 
if sanders becomes president seriously see becoming part cabinet 
generous optimistic interpretation would yang attracts non traditional base typically vote any democrats absence voters regardless poll sign moving forwards important strongly repeatedly advocate democratic nominee supporters assuming think good dude faith 
it's surprising bernie yang lot non democrat anti establishment supporters regardless outcome election democratic party really needs reevaluate appeal voters clearly find something appealing progressive policy unwilling toe line 
yang libertarian running democratic ticket he draw attention non traditional demographic anti male circumcision crowd sanders depends percentages disconcerting considering scorched earth slandering candidates surrogates engage 
we need coordinated push entire campaigns supporters vote blue matter candidates i'd like see it's really troubling even starting publicly back away position 
see even half voting biden sanders' supporters listed second choice based last poll read it's perfectly possible depends means they're really crotchety old man energy want vote conniving devil know place opinion 
or left libertarians my brother falls roughly camp bernie guy he's actively supporting yang cycle many strongly hostile neoliberalism means 'no' biden klobuchar probably buttigieg well i'm firmly pro warren believe unite democratic party still progressive low voter turnout side would truly doom country seems weapon choice divide us even kin 
i've decided since i'm later state going voting whoever ahead either warren sanders love candidates main goal progressive win biden getting delegates really important faith superdelegates overturn results second ballot plurality majority 
it's passed statewide maine recently effect several sizable municipalities states many people think would equitable less corruptible 
would require constitutional amendment nationally least update laws individual states primaries think 
i've also felt extorted positioning sanders base one interactions explicitly threatened huge portion vote trump nominee 
and would hesitant vote sanders even general election after supporters acted last continue divide democrats refuse sure could good conscience primary see base left's equivalent trump filled rhetoric anger irrational cult personality now bad terrified unleash radical left movement unlike trump's created more importantly crazies rational thought policy making window replaced populist actions sanders' woefully inadequate knowledge business banking actually disastrous economy unlike warren plan everything makes angry outrageous statements little way he'll make things happen the sad reality choice i'll sit one or hell move melbourne aussie wife 
if important goal defeat trump elizabeth warren person everyone votes she whip smart passionate pragmatic shout hyperbole turns moderates coalition builder gets shit done i'm tired fucking yelling imagine voters well interested exchanging one old man another 
so warren largely acceptable camps nominee 
perhaps see iowa right bernie becoming polarising fairly substantial never block you perhaps reason vote viewed way suggest place context biden vs trump clearly ideological fanatical refusal compromise bode well for worth saying nominee includes strongly ideologically aligned like warren yang extent steyer 
because there's logical reason called progressives vote progressive candidate 
believe their two camps seem consistently nicest across demographics also subs really stand reason biden camp bad kinda boring without energy sorry anyone disagrees limited perception 
holy shit just clicked link they're actively campaigning sabotage democrats 
the stance policy change matters removing trump going governing ignored ordinary americans presidency victory that vbnmh really resonate many issues dem presidencies gop ones half argument biggest issue vs getting board keeps absolute highest number dem voters table general 
being independent get my problem people obviously care bernie policies commit voting dem best even less they want central figure believe feel outside establishment and literally president right the called evil compared 
but hate dnc much start thing or they're dollars 
why prioritizing beating trump much thought liked elizabeth warren if someone else wins satisfy desires president 
it would bad idea highly unlikely sanders pick warren running mate mention naming vp cabinet post tend think story leaked wake woman can't win controversy protect reaffirm friendship 
progressive socialist still call republican 
just call dogmatic religious fundamentalists 
people arguing bernie reached ceiling since polling he's gone further plurality biden voter's second choice sanders https thehill com hilltv americas thinking poll almost one third biden supporters pick sanders 
for past weeks bernie steadily rising polls conversely warren biden's second choice digit lead he also gaining steam texas closest head trump moment but feel free ignore said care 
important position cabinet member senate majority leader 
i've never doubt yang right thing kinda guy he's good people i'm sure he'll support whoever nominee 
this good point think part there's circular ness arguments if people unhappy status quo politics campaign establishment 'change' 'washington insiders' etc in short term gets votes somewhat represents reality but time every become attracted candidates 'outside system' you get system oscillate trump sanders and matter next candidate comes calls runs outside it's cycle lot harder repair trust tear start another reason like warren she wants make work difficult road 
regardless outcome election democratic party really needs reevaluate appeal voters clearly find something appealing progressive policy unwilling toe line suggesting they're attracted assumption lot think correct imagine people ron paul supporters past elections they progressives contrarians latch non mainstream candidate especially ones push conspiracy theories yell loudly establishment candidates corrupt might give lip service whatever issue forefront make vote support stop supporting fringe oppose like future there's nothing attract simply already turned 
in headcanon elizabeth warren would firm stance mutant's rights plan ban use sentinels mutants

trump say wants outrageous president would sell people hong kong behind closed doors the public must see transcript trump's call xi and need leader stand values 
china listening please publish transcript phone call trump you heavily rewarded press 
the statement perfect it conversation 
even bart simpson would better president 
know seen lot lately quality civic leadership y'all she's going let shit get skin take lying focused goal good governance rather in one tweet demonstrated much constructive approach domestic foreign politics trump 
saying trump hard enough china kinda ridiculous though 
wait asking foreign country assist campaign candidate that's illegal 
bowl dry dog turds would better president 
this literally standing democracy hong kong china help our preeminent values supposed support self determination face authoritarianism raging trade deficits 
do think trumps trade strategy efficient likely cause desirable outcomes best available 
is possible give negative gold 
trump weak china probably weakest since nixon that's trade deficit record highs 
the guy quoting dotard asked russia find hillary's emails 
as someone running say yes it would lot perception country release transcript president trying extort in reality cannot trump tell xi whatever fuck weigh immediate consequences cooperating while understand sentiment could seen slightly borderline literally something our openly extorting multiple countries gain give two shits biden really warren also criminal lock side i'm tired government lock fucks prove anything to ultra clear trump committed crime doubled whataboutisms prosecute double means doj fbi investigating 
all trade strategies increasing cost american consumers 
lock this irrational trumpists sigh 
and permanently costing us exporters strategic partner 
why binary is entire relationship two largest economies easily boiled hard not room additional nuance across nation million billion people trumps trade war inefficient mess likely going end offering concessions china trying avoid domestic recession hurt reelection campaign despite fact already paid enormous costs fighting all long term problems trade relation addressed signing tpp initiation multilateral attempt bring compliance western world wanted we solution built years got politicized race presidential nominees said would scrap then trump did years worth work thrown floor replaced tariff regime hurts way needed but even offers silence hong kong no benefit united states it horrible enough put price heads worse pathetically small 
no if leader violated law follow due course don't break attacking political opponent think warren it's pretty simple expect representatives to clear i'm pro warren biden thing bs fuck partisan shit get criminals office one arguing investigating absurd legal argument way illegal super investigated trump clinton bill probably obama that's fine duty extent asking china ukraine acceptable election period

who else cast supported warren this makes happy hear 
ron dislikes government scorns dishonest unreliable otherwise shady people he ethical capitalist believe grudgingly support liz respect outweighs ideological differences leslie knope personified 
and even he's still pretty much feminist minus two sociopaths named tammy 
him megan major couple goals 
you attack ron swanson twitter 
rich celebrity political opinion mean exactly newsworthy

there's lot hate trying scare sanders supporters away either stick simply divide democratic party entirely nobody wants remember hundreds articles fact filling gap filled warren decided run in hearing said want say elizabeth one smartest people senate noting talked president fond real progressive https www politico com story bernie sanders election we're divisive media reddit community saying no are not same commondreams org views warren lies bloody shame

it's good country they'll learn cope look they're nice people maybe go coffee see happens this democracy work 
presidentelizabethwarren trends after she announces intentions to investigate crimes against immigrants if elected white house 
this one major techniques we're going use defeat gop forward no country needs move bullshit crimes committed we're nation laws these people deserve due process found guilty need prison also give respect humans beings concentration camps fair trial preferably bail fail jail conditions justice 
hold anyone houses congress accountable votes that would radical move right direction 
warren candidate justice agenda want 
i'm going honest think lot driving support boldly comes trump every time strength candidates can't quite match of course plans policies getting attention great one things catches eyes voters otherwise pay i'll admit part got interested candidacy 
crimes against human rights multiple violations now base truly fired even though genuinely came heart still great idea they also need investigate missing babies think actually adopted 
she's office start don't understand people talking helping camps years need action 
stop equating immigrants illegal aliens pushing plantation mentality uninformed disgraceful 
that's enough people need go jail ah hem mcconnell 
it's one reasons looking electable right behind biden as continues weak trump going eventually look wins iowa new hampshire his reaction impeachment length time took get made 
because legislative branch executive this saying thread ppl need senate good policies precisely head pous 
as president sign eo knock bullshit clout executive bodies legislator ton red tape go likely get blocked anyways 
she really position it scope current job 
mean could try like mcconnell going let anything come kinda waste time her better spent developing plan action things president 
republicans would shut every turn assume 
focus investigate crimes meaningful plan 
fbi does pretty good job already 
because pandering just like every politician 
an illegal immigrant still and someone something unlike applying asylum punishment fit crime living place legal right severe justifies taken family put concentration camp 
holding accountable ruling jail it pretty open ended thing say 
it's crazy far apart philosophically close conclusions policy there article posted sub people liked different bernie like similar think see candidate appeals would detailed debate instead shit show we've sit too many candidates qualified next hopefully pbs better job

she publicly shame really he shaming everything brought peg behavior history warren refused let change subject settle lame apology 
mean buzzkill bloomberg pinned this damage control keep relevant million investment presidential run when warren president dealing gop shame which handcuffs needed for wells fargo facebook 
that's exactly voters want though 
personally i'd like president able act adult use proper behavior get things done not high schooler starring first play 
no lol bloomberg trying run office find billionaires capitulated due shame involved wanting public what spam 
the problem works democrats sure helps get dem candidate tries trump feel shame feeling part republican 
sure makes us feel good without accomplishing anything do think koch brothers care publicly shamed or larry ellison 
bloomberg loves shamed it means headlines he running campaign destroy legitimacy democratic primary and succeeding think trump bad reality tv star bringing cheese dnc real quick 
he going release cherry picked nda's 
me father actually wrote new hampshire according wants someone fight trump dirty regardless public discourse the odd bit he's long time biden supporter voted sanders primary but also former yorker soon flamed started talking bloomberg 
right shame something people feel if simply muscle matter shameful actions forcefully bring light waiting trump billionaires suddenly start feeling shame missing point 
that trump dumpster the problem republicans republican voters still support without independent gonna come short election day 
removed know joking still allowed 
why think debates people outside wealth class public they want humiliated like bloomberg 
think destroyed legitimacy democratic primary anything hurting moderate democrats whether knows 
think point somewhere giving bad candidate free unearned media legitimacy democratic party bloomberg reality tv star little much 
the bloomberg sub yes exists roughly strong wow years sounds like nonissue as three every single one lol 
know fair say cherry picked might well but three and think clear entirety bloomberg's money canon fire women decide speak 
imagine many ndas could pick choose good bad ones 
dude touch realize releasing makes non released look horrrible problay paid theee money release certain details withhold others 
but he's also former new yorker soon biden flamed started talking bloomberg guessing black brown 
hope right keeps digging hole 
or even like expected number harassment claims he's great job wow look women harassed 
every time sub want ask entire thing practical joke kind genuinely cannot imagine looking current field seeing bloomberg thinking yep top pick 
the bloomberg sub yes exists roughly strong wonder get paid join participate 
found sub called bloomberg this political predates election 
imagine first became standard operating procedure least sort shadow policy 
very jewish in fact mother part greek think get bothered authorities 
speculate outcome election know classify independent voters parties need win tend ones live echo chambers also fluid votes go along whatever pressing issues moment 
guess wait super tuesday polling looking bernie's favor probably put majority especially bloomberg klobachar pete biden splitting moderate votes 
it honestly insane effective money blanketing baggage admit saw could get paid tweet really considered second lmao but know kinda shit would still helping getting elected christ even sounds like shilling 
those rookie numbers total jv squad look many donny now there's man knows harass lady right only years what loser 
honestly company size bloomberg partners cases thirty years would genuinely impressive that's case though 
honestly get bad vibes see face feel like shark swimming coral reef like list power if win nothing would make happier proven wrong spectacular but radiates everything dislike america politics lol 
went blockwalking warren two weeks ago nice neighborhood pretty sure lists voters voted dem last election more told really republicans seriously considering bloomberg alternative trump he ads every channel texas i'm also republicans bernie democratic primary trying subvert hilary proud outrighted bragged edit these people intended vote actually sell one like small business owner started going corruption difficult compete big companies playing rules 
that's lot us felt td 
some literally getting paid support online generally avoid accusing people shills campaign openly advertises paying promote social media 
well good chunk party statistically wealthy white male older side sounds reasonable but say want compete trump old rich guy dept one wins warren first choice certainly knows representing minorities bloomberg purchase way field actual people win without paid pretty damn policies represent working class 
do wrong cash cheque man 
yeah could accidentally harm good donate candidate choice lol 
if ended sad would guessed copied trump twitter feed 
someone posted somewhere maybe running trump could win take tinfoil hat 
oh see that place sus 
misc reddit comments claiming campaign pays digital optics aka shitposting great twitter hours week 
andrew yang elizabeth warren deserves better 
warren yang smartest people race edit pete 
actually surprised better comes good bridge candidate moderates progressives 
he getting eviscerated twitter there something deeply troubling within cult personality sprung bernie come warren trump 
warren deserved better she connected smart people wanted realistic progressive changes implemented intelligent strategic planning scalpel instead brute force bully pulpit some saying stole votes another candidate nope showed path forward made believe progress also pragmatic in end loudest man room tends drown academics irony everyone talks policy it ultimately cult personality 
well huge chunk support says yeah amazing love smart but electable this happens 
yang voted warren yesterday this makes smile 
comments disgusting insane say means much since honestly yang seems loved respected pretty former competition hell guy talked missing booker stage backed bernie still like also clearly likes joe he's realy friendly wishes everyone could great 
we deserve elizabeth warren better her loss would regular americans 
in facing hard truths lately hate say think informed educated warren preferred pick given much propaganda floating around undermining warren's campaign need lot time cut nonsense still intend vote hope runs convention though 
nevertheless persisted it size fight dog got enough till end disclaimer yanggang 
yeah odd better feel like conspiracy when look two old men leading race makes wonder favor someone that's youthful track record making differences 
bernie dropped heart attack endorsed warren this could completely different race 
honestly pretty undecided would pick came sanders biden behavior supporters much sealed think tell lot candidate predominant followers liking i'm seeing 
this kind stuff supporters makes want write warren come november it's irritating bernie said running situation we're 
love yang second choice candidate it disheartening big field diverse intelligent candidates many fresh ideas winnowed two shouting old white guys the mainstream media put fat thumb scale chosen political equivalent plain yogurt us 
love andrew yang hope see hear lot future 
and i'll switching support biden warren get nomination id never give bernie cult satisfaction 
exactly deserved recognized shown respect she siphoning steal candidates vote earned people chose 
as bernie voter contested convention lead hope warren would enough put one top and give delegates voting heart causes go senator lived vt head says think selfless getting behind said done huge stay staying net dropped since people see two way race it liz 
warren definitely deserves better reality situation lost home state third place 
really appreciate yang saying he's one we need people start bowing woman single handedly tanking bloomberg's campaign 
agree warren drew around female voters massachusetts blows mind she solid progressive background knowledge issues sure ton analysis happen coming weeks 
like yang his ubi initiative laziest bad faith silicon valley privileged version concept but kind words appreciated 
feel physical pain see much kindness primary lost yang now warren shaky rails taking energy really eager canvas ready go door like thing know going able give besides vote election day worn friends 
warren would make great vp biden 
super tuesday rough progressive wing democratic party joe biden riding high impressive win south carolina slew vip endorsements handily cleaned last night sanders may lion's share biggest prize california remains seen many candidates viable golden state my knee jerk reaction feel anger towards warren dropping endorsing pete amy or depressed eligible young voters stayed home expressing enthusiastic support either kept thinking insane nearly half virginia made mind vote hours this morning thought likely future race ahead delegate count not insurmountable number frontrunner beat mike bloomberg embarrassed he spent billion dollars non contests including higher average clip poorly think chance drop endorse pouring cash joe's coffers if happens done ally help want supporter builds supporters 
not surprising guy ran platform likes math would appreciate woman detailed nerdy plan everything 
yeah true we talk racism misogyny hurdles country anti intellectualism big one well if seen smart likely negative positive bonkers 
america could never get behind 
and pete signed someone supported way super tuesday jumping onto team liz 
warren always yang case dropped now i'm sad vote blue reluctantly believe candidates better trump still sucks 
yang apparently considering running nyc mayor next year 
the smartest average person dumb realize 
oh think pete demonstrably also intelligent person absolutely hated campaign policies etc dude undeniably smart 
literally pathological it's form brigading i'm sure russia nothing formation 
if still want bring vote sanders wins nomination go comments section warren's facebook page 
the one said warren unlikable can't control arms lol can't laugh new berner attack i've heard 
if ranked choice think better people need consider electability voting current system but everyone votes based thought others would chance one choose top even many also 
honestly think wanted candidate would liked progressives progressive also moderates democratic socialist loyal party what ended happening politics fraught divisiveness disliked which sucks best 
same she literally checked every box could bring progressive reforms comfort center actually better 
sanders supporter hope mind commenting think lot progressives going left bernie grand platitudes moderates safer 'reliable' joe leaving warren middle election that's got everyone taking sides another thing earlier media coverage would perk buttigieg klobuchar deride giving less just 
it cnn telling us front runners start proper voting system 
you know like bernie sanders part makes think base thinks trump better democratic candidates that gonna hurt us november 
get bernie voters blame warren sanders losing lead biden bloomberg way moreso still bros refusing build wider ideological tent killed shifted support pete joe true second choice voting today i'd voted anyways here's hoping plays big part whatever next adminstration 
bernie supporters building cult personality around anyone board threat attacked gotten reaction 
that never go trump they likely feel sorry voters explain away white supremacy fault democratic policies failed working class men fetishize it's gross 
bernie starting look like trump least cult looks mirror image maga 
for many fight survival its less warren factors biden opinion seems largely unserious solving large scale problems normal people it's hes bad guy doesnt exactly exude passion actually reduce debt provide reasonable pathway younger generation start building families obviously trump dumpster fire so adjusting reality vs joe whatever means in sanders real serious candidates election theyre ones proposing comprehensive ideas cover broad range issues one slight shot win plurality delegates looking like might case contested convention underperformed trying accumulate winning would really sour way nomination think coming frustration one completely disheartened by warren's lack success ultimately worry general consequence economic collapse medical costs continuing balloon millennials cant afford homes delaying starting wildlife environment climate change future kids beyond political democrats results mean lose overall and different time could worse but times believe worst challenges ahead us his cognitive decline troubling honest worried seem concerned pain feel years someone obviously give rat's ass need truly passionate part wishes drop endorse hope hopes stays maybe get bleak 
they come everyone like get it going peaceful anti war rally small group shows screaming anarchy starts throwing bottles rocks 
seriously person cant even opinion endorsement without sell bought changed etc 
it absolutely popularity contest we see student government elections well sucks 
those people never supporters they reaching yet another albeit polite reason vote woman 
he wants democrats band together support because end think that's way defeat trump at moment looks like gonna happen 
yang's good boy hope see 
remember defending steyer debate funny exchange thanks problem man yang good guy 
it really hard avoid feeling but way media report comment extensively talking people finished behind biden suddenly came front started gushing well get crusty conspiracies 
think conspiracy simplest answers often right good old fashion american misogyny 
it would truly progressive thing 
yup stepping aside elevating woman possibly first female president would greatest act allyship ever witnessed not us 
exactly many sanders supporters realize much vitriol pushes away actually trying win 
considering ton bernie supporters wrote instead voting hrc general admit tempting but really let behavior affect us we need get behind whomever nominee afford four years trump do rbg 
makes want write warren come november please reconsider the way us electoral system set guarantees voting spoiler candidates losing strategy future millions people depends disaffected vote egos consider putting energy reforming local state laws ensure conscience instead compromising ideals learn https represent us 
did bernie actually say ran warren know 
yeah missteps love elizabeth think strategic choices made turned big mistakes it disappointing but also would much different race bernie either run announced candidacy dropped endorsed heart attack this given lot faith strength progressive movement us general 
agreed going say she'd make excellent president momentum moment hope biden picks vp opportunity arises 
not sure getting downvoted she deserves national leader executive powers if gets biden train would powerful force also one corona virus away presidency 
the root anger based misconception us would've voted bernie dropped that's likely campaign surrogates supporters burned bridge ideological allies if vote gone biden we solely ideology we're electing leader president set policies 
good hear there's disturbing hivemind narrative bernie bubble elizabeth endorsed would've not everyone voted warren second choice fact the remaining split among moderates some would voters panicked biden worried losing trump boosting else unless thought he'd easy beat even many votes still gone could attract failed build bridge toward 
really get to next sharing progressive values intelligence important quality candidate care less inspiring speeches ridiculous purity standards best qualified job when comes complicated things like healthcare system foreign affairs want smartest person charge feel could good bernie president talking easy give what's wrong and terrifies would terrible 
seriously look whos winning trump biden smartest people room 
think anti intellectualism tends get wildly misunderstood seen intelligence ever least since maybe middle school what exist dislike intellectuals meaning people intelligent sort elitist snobbery they look lot time they're correct if someone thinks upbringing means right valuable every issue garbage human whose highest use following orders elites like person of course often perceived 
yea look dem frontrunner literally dumbest people race 
believe candidates better trump still sucks vote reluctantly for personally i've never felt reluctant cases like enthusiastic voting clinton would great president i'll happy either sanders biden november along downballot dems 
rumor nothing backing he's supposed big announcement tomorrow going the view would odd place announce something like suspect thing people waiting start foundation provide ubi mothers care givers etc one points yang consistently hit campaign trail lot important work gets valued zero economy seems fit apparently everyone dnc likes quietly back burner hilary considered running platform timing right program income stay home moms win tons middle class women trump performed well 
hope wins but dont live nyc 
ignore life better ignore shitty comments 
heck go this page subreddit the mods working overtime still see allllll removed troll comments ironically bernie supporters favor making look benign towards elizabeth definitely 
or warren's twitter feed feel sorry social media team 
for online comments problem it's surrogates get disingenuous even nasty pissed 
it's real shame see progressives fight warren sanders little publicly stop get need compete feel lack solidarity among leftists america think lot comes bad faith outsiders using freedom online anonymity destroy positive discourse democratic primary quite fallen victim trap 
strongly considering voting hope elizabeth still state finally votes one last ones think really want partly responsible either biden bernie nominee used would go way supporters acted then vote blue general

good stuff loving before iowa nobody thought obama chance need 
what mean unmatched i'm warren supporter curious like iowa right pre january 
what makes campaign stand sanders biden iowan 
advertising revenue enough support real journalism scope wapo their peer publications also require subscription 
wapo newspaper pay subscription if amazon prime get one month for worth amount news 
you always open incognito window

wonder difference dynamic obama major issue pre iowa clinton slaughtering among black voters many thought white americans elect president win demolished notion soon started pulling ahead important south carolina particular warren still somehow break going compete biden states across south 
that bullshit cowardly attack don divide dem candidates trump huge favor 
sanders warren different biden far political plans moderate whereas progressive laid plainly websites 
then wapo become nonprofit ask donations never pay profit corporation tell information inherent right human it absolutely absurd someone makes public interest journalism 
they ones pay well that's primarily app best lol i'd rather nyt ah 
agree comparison strong reasons cited want point case like waiting movement front people noticed support among black voters starting rise south carolina people go straight horse race poll showing biden leading big change warren that's slightly less half white sc if reasonable lead would look lot national back may and articles one https www nytimes com us politics joe biden html 
dude response question history slavery black parents know parent they quite then went record players sending social workers peoples' homes teach what going 
see warren organizers volunteers everywhere are mostly women men woman 
think asking local campaign iowa stands compared others policy wise 
everyone right sell content see fit i'm willing pay think publically funded journalism we're always going private news agencies that's way goes 
high calibre journalists deserve make decent living 
you think journalists salaries gonna appear thin air 
yeah think we're page i'm sure strong iowa performance right kind catalyst break black voters it'll take something else probably maybe results new hampshire and people start paying attention race would but she'll definitely need better among vs biden going nominee 
generally former presidents endorse like bill endorsed hillary obvious reasons that's exception 
love biden says sure could beat trump later drop getting less iowa vote that's possible winning that's losing miserably regardless agree article lot people's attacks he's competent politician would awesome quite roles national scale he right person presidency opinion not election anyways he's incompetent chance real change positive way first time long one promising 
tearing candidates nothing candidate fact harms take warren conduct example 
i'm avnerd's second opinion removing comment posting pieces clearly state can't health claim he's mentally competent political debate mudslinging 
from opinion piece linked never examined former vice president cannot comment directly health and yet goes ask rule community educated one think summation link mentally competent i'm waiting second removing please feel free edit civil 
think biden age truly issue obama obviously endorsing former president traditionally endorse anyone primaries 
past presidents endorse candidates primaries it's unfair process 
i'm saying biden goes negative going accelerate campaign's implosion 
no one bullshit attacks related terrible record cowardly lame help trump 
seen speak person get anyone watches immediately fall love candidacy all early takes lacking charisma connecting voters confusing felt like taking crazy pills watching woman 
no nobody right sell anything the information content wapo produces made humans property never owned anyone we need eliminate backwards capital focused ways thinking order move truly equal future under philosophy someone less money informed world how make sense 
for sure think change slow though like every part success no big tipping point one day we'll wake it'll dead heat 
hope primary voters come awareness successful democratic presential nominee run agent change since we go back keep things steady state 
there's also plenty whenever opens mouth ignore current state peril it absolutely table point can't string coherent sentence together anymore this primary nothing limits save hand holding 
thank second opinion especially since edit 
there difference endorsing asking biden embarrass 
attack record stoop trump level 
bullshit this currently competition it election biden candidate helps trump that truth right 
this phenomenally dumb argument the actual poll free offered online http cdn cnn com images desmoinescnnpoll pdf although even polls still costly conduct terms money manhours expecting someone contribute support costs term accessing feels reasonable what article break key results inform readers opinion newspaper important service writers providing external obligation provide requesting amount continue fair you're making pretty big leap people right information relevant lives broadly agree collect digest unreasonable it makes much sense going food sustenance would hope typhoonone cook dinner 
gonna go longer response i'm stick saying dumb take there's point made publically funded media fix 
what right say someone else sell labor there lots ways organize society one proposing substantially less free today 
in warren sub rule dividing democrats want assist trump keep we need biden supporters primary 
attacking candidates poor strategy obviously people chosen support warren unlikely need hear negatives order convinced bonafides 
stoop whatever level wins election kids locked forced menstruate clothes going high pyrrhic victory dooms children 
have faith take lead without attacks comes time general alienated supporters 
the polls shifting warren without descending negativity she going win want biden voters vote angry stay home 
you dividing pushing supporters saying opinion joe biden ability job tis conversation made unsubscribe stop monthly donations warren campaign my matters voice goodbye 
well alienated why always acquiesce vote biden support if blindly joe part elizabeth warren campaign edit see going like unsubscribe subreddit so donate volunteer have nice election 
we're sorry see go policy changing representatives warren campaign feel strongly letting overheated division take root the negative stories surely get play elsewhere purpose sub promoting tearing opponents 
there's reason stop supporting warren supporters act way agree allowed say biden reddit run knowledge not campaign 
yup we went high hillary president because civil wins elections 
if would take support candidate want president people mean internet serious doubts intention ever genuine 
not making personal attacks biden supporting but yes basic level support going turn around ask supporters vote liz general 
no one asking blindly support biden we're personally attack there's huge amount area options clearly many us particularly agree issues ultimately candidate chosen team want see repeat half party completely alienated opposite it's possible disagree civil divisive 
it seems mainly run warren volunteers worked staffer senate campaign assuming lot interns subreddit working votes vote primary makes general but donations stopped support joe biden and staging get us switch wins thank this made rethink involved election volunteer feel like cares people mainstream regular proven 
we go high fuck talking 
well want support something told someone else like so supporting warren means biden focus things believe 
saying someone mentally unwell able job personal attack that fact biden ability 
saying someone job unwell personal attack 
said 'don't make fun joe biden' think that's bit much tbh like i'm pro 'shit next person there's anyway tell official staff real power subreddit also guarantee biden going win either we've discussed death he's falling polls can't even speak coherently anymore sorry quite get beef 
please take toxicity elsewhere unless doctor personal knowledge mental health speculation outside sharing warren related content subreddit discussing policy infighting welcome kind 
yes personal attack saying someone unwell especially there's substantial evidence and regardless whether specifically seem advocating allowed personally said basically stopped supporting warren people asked divisive 
the dnc change rules ensure good diverse candidates could remain debate stage they let billionaire billionaires allowed play different democracy government 
this might get voted dnc changed rules force bloomberg onto stage they worried would run away buying airtime giving candidates chance attack 
glad forcing bloomberg stage this good campaign and logical standpoint makes perfect sense change qualifying thresholds reflect know actual results 
weren't campaigns wanting rules change force blomberg debates 
call crazy like nobody likes bloomberg plus bernie warren going tee obvious corrupt horse shit say steyer guy put work get enough grassroots support 
it bother much they're letting bloomberg stage going debate format th time many people slight variations questions candidates giving answers they've already given want see series debates would give us better sense candidate perform general election head 
getting call dnc elevating billionaires poc win trash bloomberg stage either way these good optics 
bloomberg needs face scrutiny debate stage 
sure feel happy bloomberg finally get heat at time wish rules could bent earlier castro booker bigger role then field needed narrowed one candidate left still like warren lol 
it seems pretty crazy guy could polling making massive ad buys appear debate would look good nominee skipped debates avoided direct questioning or allow someone enough delegates alone trigger contested convention that nuts honestly always thought donation criteria distasteful idea based money and finally point actual makes sense change rules focus potential delegate strength 
yang echoed similar sentiment https twitter com andrewyang status 
tbh i'm fine rules change think bloomberg's entry hurts anyone it'll biden create opening actual progressive candidates 
expect he'll take many votes warren sanders definitely biden buttigieg klobuchar this could help progressive wing takes enough stays states 
hope attack bloomberg buying way onto debate 
can skip debates say part strategy mean like needs exposure going opens criticism others said must admit fear action bend rules billionaire become republican attack line sides corruption argument 
this good the dnc rules prevent someone getting support stage donor metric always stupid one 
he's real life monty burns 
totally agree there's way i'm voting bloomberg 
like bloomberg makes skin crawl agree he's polling double digits rated polls can't understand democrats angling milquetoast moderate billionaire bought way onto stage needs debates the booker situation little different passed donor qualification dropped around 
think assumes moderators give candidates opportunity critique and set questions sure dnc allow 
mean think fair hes stage since sizable showing polls he receive ridicule everyone else 
kind feel bad he going get skewered stage front national audience in serious note needs made example as party can't tolerate anyone running campaign sooooo offended headed senator warren good point bloomberg thinks cheaper run presidential ads rather pay wealth taxes glad debate hope candidates form voltron like electoral candidate vivisect 
riiiight lobbing tons negative press effective way stopping candidate totally unqualified if anything helps giving exposure name recognition wins elections putting debate stage legitimizes campaign also ignoring massive donation made dnc prior he bought make excuses actively trying help trump get reelected again 
ok showing large bump polls let us see say 
yeah bloomberg always decline staying campaign way terms the whole thing makes dnc look bad 
glad forcing bloomberg stage this good campaign mean is msot definitely boat jim polls just present boost people that's push things like rule changes allow voices debate especially third party candidates general elections and logical standpoint makes perfect sense change qualifying thresholds reflect know actual results so could changed rules depending anything chose money 
yeah dunking dnc billionaires time like free votes might minority think minimum donor threshold dumb idea start someone poll nationally stage regardless fund campaign actually really liked booker castro others shot debates get anywhere bloomberg might basically buying he's able fool voters hopefully candidates rag face fades back irrelevance that's completely aside fact wanted he'd you buy donors investing fundraising easily numbers want he'd rather spend truckloads cash message uncontested via ads go debate defend 
source claim https www politico com news bloomberg progressives leftists dnc progressive allies elizabeth warren approached democratic national committee lobby unusual cause including billionaire mike bloomberg upcoming presidential primary debates the move described politico co founder change campaign reflects desire liberal activists pin former new york mayor avoided verbal combat opponents waging self funded campaign plays rules but entreaty also speaks progressives' growing unease bloomberg's relative success after spending hundreds millions dollars vaulted double digits national polls amassed giant staff level operatives 
plus bernie warren going tee obvious corrupt horse shit he can't go debate get absolutely right 
let's forget racist bullshit stop frisk happened largely 
mild respect steyer he awkward seems like good heart 
if we're lucky he'll split biden vote 
see candidates hitting anywhere it really biden bernie warren iowa winner pete klobachar maybe bloomberg guess steyer might pull would shocked also possible traditional get delegates case hear 
want town hall style debates feel like questions rallies generic iowans far superior proposed moderators 
yang diverse candidate dnc shoved raising polling limits without qualifying poles debates changing rule face new would not keep people color stage recognizing reality they need allow guys like let's change get thing either 
yang right steyer masterful hitting donor requirements it hard set anti trump shop get sales especially bloomberg's budget 
think skipping debate qualifies would good look people guy supposed one take trump afraid democratic 
having part debate takes time away people stage it also dilutes messaging allows seem like corporatist perspective far common actually essentially makes number progressives voices vs non progressive different ratio would otherwise gives airtime moderate and giving bloomberg power either attend sense whatsoever it's okay moderates qualified everyone else but literally rigging things allow despicable regardless positive negative effect act 
it's milquetoast moderate millions millions voters want return normalcy selling important constituency needs assuaged recognized folded coalition forms months 
opposite happens protect feed slow ball questions almost certainly bolster 
he needs made example no opportunity debate running president avoid wealth taxes would incredibly stupid warren's logic mistake dnc change rules means equally two wrongs make right what 
in vacuum told voting starts primary decider gets debate stage would say makes perfect sense votes matter anything else going change opinion billionaire beneficiary 
this notably warren campaign zephyr teachout bernie supporting groups allowed position things 
came post this behavior left towards dnc easily manipulated bad actors toxic people per usual 
this feels like dnc trying get bat shit republican candidates trump become nominee thought would easy pickings 
which policy fully supported last year he basically said great effective decided run president 
calling names great argument we need better candidates bloomberg qualified several others mayor new york city versus mayor south bend indiana no contest 
that would make sense wanted president but wants get enough delegates kingmaker brokered convention influence democratic party nominee policies he pulling barely saying word might 
trump skipped republican debate bloomberg would perfect answer 
understand passionate must avoid name calling removed dividing democrats 
but three rights make left the joke red green 
it took entered race apologize surprised slightest mean shit 
he going get delegates all media attention results debates impeachment wrapping simply spamming ads enough counter balance coverage front runners start 
trump also leading polls months iowa caucus participated every debate bloomberg entered late fourth could easily slide th pete strong showing yet stage tries use talking point think fall flat 
yeah remember apologizing november think so still last year around time starting primary crap but cheerleader he mean apology it politically prudent fake remorse he's always way this guy changed term limits give rd nyers mostly loathe know 
mean pulling seen polls higher remember threshold also per precinct definitely get delegates place like new york etc time tell well ad spamming work to honest never level 
months that quarter billion dollars ad spending clearly working getting started it totally dwarfs candidates literally making rates go for comparison https projects fivethirtyeight com campaign ads bloomberg steyer sanders buttigieg yang warren biden outspent frontrunner almost orders magnitude 
the threshold per congressional district primary states 
yea rcp polling average you think going rise polls getting delegates iowa nh absent debate 
well certainly looks like healthy functioning democracy 
oh true makes feel bit better but trump longer ignore worst case scenarios bloomberg vs would least signify end democracy country 
after trump rule infinite capacity american voter willfully vote self interest 
imagine bloomberg steyer spent million voter registration turnout ballot candidates the positive impact would tremendous 
it capacity american voter willfully vote self interest thing timing trump may come nowhere general sort way announced beginning race like normal candidate leading polls end summer people severely underestimating effect first four states going far media coverage momentum voters candidates get significant bumps month remains stagnant he buy ads february delegates perhaps importantly bloomberg dominate commercial breaks super tuesday named dominating news cycle 
college students favor elizabeth warren bernie sanders first time months 
genuinely curious see aoc endorsement make swing back 
poll likely last debates people unsure bernie's health status hopefully holds 
college student favor voting first foremost care wins among long fucking vote 
think either bernie warren get big youth turnout lot young people campaigning general kind like got obama 
the people check likely consider also i'm sure economics courses started might something 
not like matters college students barely vote my peers apathetic politics honestly super disheartening 
i'm college student fully prepared vote whichever one two best shot time primary rolls around state 
love sanders warren think needs adamant put plans place she's still playing politician stance giving without implementation things would like forth direct way pay everything stand stage it rough seeing answer question middle class incomes increase say that's lie fine less overall else 
warren per say really hope bernie get support back 
there respondents this good news read much 
exactly i've seen uptick efforts pit democrats see point unless goal bring dems altogether right i'm rooting warren interest finding faults bernie i'll vote whoever wins nomination 
yuuuuuuuup the country would immeasurably better either one 
that's i'm subbed sanders' sub 
for real either would great 
like sanders lot voted primary much prefer warren i'd fine nominee 
i'll honest saying sanders choice right liz i'm happy sub hear ideas continue see unfortunately can't say yang's though like yang lot much supporters least reddit trump apologizers frankly people's posts grating still hope sticks around contributes goddamn annoying want someone win actually cares help common person would estactic nomination even technically first think exactly 
i'm fine sanders warren biden buttigieg harris klobuchar etc 
warren great poor enough difference matter vote sanders 
personally would offer prefer vote sanders think fundamentally thinks capitalism hurdle social change warren sees means leverage partnerships kickstart 
can't see biden getting vote outright gain majority convention but others like buttigieg harris propping exchange cabinet spots so there's way support also warren sanders solo either think camps need get enough delegate shares maintain combined block centrists if fail looking president 
i'll admit aoc endorsement shifted leaning towards bernie still prefer subreddit tho y'all polite 
anecdotal all friends supported bernie heart attack unshaken think matter warren getting name recognition policies for college students know default 
regardless great momentum shows warren capable showing progressive strength new generation covets sanders 
also high profile endorsements received past couple days 
how donald trump president record college tuition prices decide stay politics 
typo also recall saying anything like 
that pretty solid sample size 
that's pretty large actually statistically 
i've trying counter narrative best referring teacher preacher in progressive movement we're building going need we're strength vision advocacy ideally i'd like unity ticket whichever wins delegates president vp i'll also settle senate majority leader shakes edit wow first silver post triple stack thanks y'all 
yeah i'm perfectly fine people saying like one better even dont really certain candidate reason it becomes problem toxic overly blowing minor problems major spreading baseless rumors thinly veiled republican talking points but bernie warren going raise your taxes neglecting talk value taxes used much potentially save cant count number posts see starting feeling bern and ending honestly keep might vote trump or variation 
god love positive sub it's refreshing change politics 
it's always self proclaiming berniebros point believe bad actors right trying sow division legitimate interest primary i'm way insinuating bernie supporters like it reeks divisive tactics used last time whole bust crap voted hell going sit pout get nomination 
would comment upvoted sanders sub 
exact way around prefer bernie vote liz happily nom 
idea know talking honest think understand either candidate economic policy 
anecdotal counterpoint lot friends supported bernie supporting warren heart attack would include i'm citizen can't vote 
now need channel lets donate volunteer liz https secure actblue com redditforwarren 
removed violating rule dividing democrats 
candidate great economic policy plans college kids learn economics vote candidate profit nation edit apparently memes legitimate form discourse bad answers i'm dumbass reddit lol 
youth turnout always low main reasons they're new voting the transition child mostly insulated politics adult capable sudden voting anyway infrequent thing something exposed thus used politics mainly old people concerns healthcare taxes stuff dominates political debates older tuition costs environment young boost youth system geared towards tend highly mobile settled transient biased 
i'm sure presidency made impact ego nihilism runs deep edgy young 
probably confused beto also tried trap corner plans universal childcare pre asking taxes go she responded flatly because that's plan works screwed trying jump tax bandwagon 
guess but representative different schools income levels parts country i'm taking polling grain salt 
i've trying counter narrative best referring teacher preacher love people seem think better one drops consolidate progressives honestly running especially debates back imagine bernie vs amy pete joe beto booker or warren block instead they're able support consequently formidable imho 
referring teacher preacher this perfect going start using and idea ticket appealing feel like wasting one talents vp usually fairly ceremonial role currently hoping bernie presidency warren senate majority leader would play strengths honestly happy either outcome though 
think president majority leader would effective building consensus senate that said deciding vote may important depending elections turn 
that's think next presidency warren would best leading bernie my concern please take russian talking point discredit tht might perfect health optimistically years america whole respomn well could help transition country if disagree feel free tell this opinion non american maybe nuances i've missed 
except many people america want preacher that's bad way describe 
the democrats would never elect bernie senate majority leader 
and every candidate's sub except buttigieg supporters warm biden 
bad actors right mostly russians seriously 
bernie bust even real thing voters overwhelmingly supported hillary general mostly centrist republican leaning independents likely would voted democrat except 
bernie bros also self proclaimed titled pushed disingenuously election cycle alienate people supporting framing supporters angry cis gender white men it actually pretty misogynistic insulting many women poc support that said warren great 
highly upvoted comment pretty similar specifically arguing propagating negativity warren then mod removed posts thread shitting apparently good faith bernie's reddit contingent weird mixture progressive positivity hardliner tribalism even though still support bernie latter really turned away sanders subs 
possibly though say sub probably level headed subscribers candidate subs i've seen 
not divisive response edit why'd delete reply https imgur com tboas 
sanders housing for all bill would personally affect it best interest vote warren 
what mean at least senator warren made clear capitalist sanders less inclined throw support behind founding principals and say much conversation rhetoric policy if would like point flaws thinking happy reflect reassess 
part time job donate month everyone pitch little something make big difference 
but bernie warren's economic policies largely differ scale what undergraduate intro economics class would cover anything relevant much less something distinguish two candidates particular 
who would consider i'm confused 
given they'll inherit environmental crisis trump hastening astounds know boomers get lot blame group one sit election 
oh right her answer truth she's paying wealth tax like says almost every time brought lol that's taxes go thing people 
no she means tested policies her student debt cancelation caps https www cnn com politics elizabeth warren medicare index html 
might depends methodology but larger sample size polls 
ok newsweek reporting someone else college pulse data survey analytics company chegg education technology launched election tracker march since launch they've asked college students weekly basis select candidate they'd like see democratic nominee president conducting poll 
agree wholeheartedly they need least voting order prevent moderate pile 
exactly debates far show bernie liz done excellently pushing message attacking biden moderates either punch struggle land sanders warren 
better yet imagine running even later looks like bernie warren biden realistic contenders opposed vs agree completely makes sense stay quite bit 
agreed that they're polling keep debates prevents either looking like batshit crazy candidate reasonable views match status quo 
agree wholeheartedly this gop overcrowded shit show right everyone curtently working move policy needles love dropouts happen voting starts 
think andrew yang going surprise everyone 
feel like wasting one talents vp usually fairly ceremonial role that totally fair point to honest lot opinions based underlying belief sanders warren presidency change rules game completely derail conventional wisdom see joining union workers strike holding rallies states whose senators bottlenecking legislation tip spear liaison breaking corporate monopolies immense power dick cheney know wield intelligently page president could strategically useful strong progressive leader branches government though 
majority leader kinda cabinet position although know would 
hear concerns can't say mistaken with elijah cummings recent death impossible avoid thinking much time leaders get good work done they could like jimmy carter building houses well there's also reason expect case kind unpopular perspective think health matters mental my favorite president fdr half paralyzed died office he four terms stewarded country one greatest crises america ever faced the first detract second it imagine world herbert hoover elected worried fdrs depression gets worse prohibition god knows wwii would turned compare today completely mentally unstable narcissist guy currently considered lead democratic side showing early signs cognitive decline we even started primary voting yet joe biden ronald reagan end term that place afford yes bernie's may justified but make decisions based fear go wrong rather want children inherit continue squander opportunities arise tired conceding shortsighted fears past build something new 
it's mostly pithy way emphasizing rock steady moral leadership think central appeal see take money ashamed nobody room years wants look kid grandchild eye child say 'grandpa knew you back scientists saying anything created look world gave that want anybody country face the guy one well developed compasses anyone i've ever seen might important factor folks worth he consistently chooses advocate right even unpopular for every mistake america made past video bernie floor congress trying stop us making that's point 
oh know case point i'm saying they're trying sow division anyway way things like bernie bust 
yes people forget clinton campaign tried obama boys term generated gained less traction bernie bro 
case point bernie camp likes yell smears never acceptable using sentence anyone would criticize try following words stop attacking democrats 
that's true meant used term describe nothing bad faith actors right 
i'm subbed admit weird bernie contingent see benefit multiple candidates running progressive campaigns on behalf good faith sanders supporters sorry not everyone like for worth can't stand nut jobs wayofthebern pretty sure that's troll farm say supporter 
warren overtaken biden predictit market democratic nomination 
these things naturally fluctuate posting time numbers warren biden sanders harris yang buttigieg gabbard booker 
that site also hillary let get excited 
it hilarious sad opponents dogpile pesky plans plan 
i've traded similar prediction betting site university iowa's iem market https iemweb biz uiowa edu markets pres html little decade in bet nomination long shot named barack obama wound making profit literally got check anyway bears mentioning november th day infamous election contracts trump win trading basically chance just goes show the crowds always know others point yes really mean polls wrong it means crowds like everyone rated chances around and occasionally things happen times do actually percentages right trump's worked 
who the hell likes biden that man definition walking clusterfuck 
plus tied biden adel iowa sweet corn festival corn kernal poll yeah we got 
these markets tend reflect participants' wishful thinking privileged knowledge read much go warren though 
would win money betting biden warren 
this great news and op contributors please know grateful hard work put sub 
i'd buy biden prices he's far shoe absurd suggest he's strongest candidate terms polling as less engaged moderates tune numbers increase to clear though much rather warren 
wonder numbers become meaningful point either near distant elections bettors start voting win wagers pundits analyzing pete rose effect polls 
love news hate anything promotes gambling 
help non american why hell bernie lead 
biden fastest way lose vote election 
big news sure remember polling necessarily betting involves mostly predictions sometimes dark horse candidates that yang percent higher like gabbard booker still thanks sharing 
heavily invested warren got weeks ago cents wins presidency well 
doubting prediction high put yang putting par butti ridiculous this thing always insane could good sign take grain salt 
so mean there's chance receives nomination 
there's enough behind scenes gossip inconceivable could jump biden crashes things go sideways brokered convention still overwhelmingly unlikely chance happens mean 
right probably boils okay concretely solve problem 
remember watching site night election thing went crazy exit polls came returns started coming 
as far tell little bit everyone biden nice bump former vp extremely popular president keep mind policy questions people still want someone feel sure beat trump self fulfilling prophecy back he's electable polls well warren clear path forward nominee despite lot backing looking thing nothing wrong let's show safe bet 
my opinion name recognition amongst politically uninformed driving high polling numbers we're talking people literally even know candidates running except biden maybe bernie i'm serious sincerely believe statistically significant number trump that's they best bet he's person whose instantly recognize they're disconnected year honestly believed two democratic nomination sanders hillary clinton idea dozen 
in race includes williamson yang biden far worst candidate he's also best bottom barrel 
an year old retired first sergeant claims biden one running get nomination thats please ageism ive never seen much hate dems elder dem 
assuming favorable outcome would win money betting yes either candidate less no the cost share you buy many shares like reach invested point cut invest maximum since cheaper reaching cap when market settles awarded wins 
really disagree think nowhere go the polling poll people currently engaged being default candidate he's choice pay attention as get involved support drop hear speak he room grow drops facade electability crack polling mostly useful trend lines stage good 
sanders decently clinton still lost partially real alternative plenty voters anti pro lots options like biden age concerns also hardcore base support also lot folks would never due ideology establishment rhetoric etc high floor low ceiling fine fractured field polling top tier but implies limited room growth winnows especially since already near universal name recognition plus numbers actually backslid recently say somebody voted probably warren 
he third polls right behind warren biden importantly huge amount room grow his base primarily younger white voters large struggles bit nonwhite older whereas well college educated 
they cherry pick polls fake news but believe warren rising bernie beat joe 
surprised there's also significant overlap people support yang gabbard trade shares online prediction markets there's probably number overly optimistic candidate making trading decisions based 
high honestly feel like yang gabbard clearer path candidates poll bit better booker beto klobuchar think went war iran gabbard's stock would rise could conceive scenario able get message smaller debate campaign starts legs he's got weird cocktail support progressives mixed lot libertarians supporters really offer anything see taking liz bernie left biden buttigieg right even harris side he's 
going primary two candidates wanted see hear warren harris and far debates still think they're best in fact i'd extremely happy democrat ticket know realistic somewhat distant second tier sorry bernie dudes dudettes sorry joe 
the prediction market good parallel metric polls also hold much water far it takes account various scenarios people imagine playing captures element mindset intuition intangibles outside which worth keeping eye age trump pete certainly polling yang neither strong path nomination easier turning around catching fire 
more less it accurate numbers add basically price 
way complicated extremely unlikely representative final outcome especially early why lot's reasons predictit basically game different types people playing differently there investors disregard personal political affiliations they use data experience make informed decisions based market invest yes no candidates depending whether think candidate currently undervalued overvalued simply want buy low sell high they're constantly looking opportunities also voters these pick one two wait close many shares possible choice rather traders maximize roi typically risk tolerance strong belief particular may win their necessarily preference however predators surge pump dumpers this person group prey optimism others newbies various ways typically introduce generate hype around price inflate cheaply purchased massive profit reason would advise investing unless convince objectively believe post could considered example nefarious dump exploit victims i'm saying for look accurate representation stands nomination you consider using investment opportunity favorite always trust intuition if new desire opinion 
everyone else pretty words warren concrete actions 
see get perspective hillary also sure thing is biden seriously considered mainstream bad candidate clinton 
gen xer not many us biden fans might think 
op asked would win money bet likely the weaker probability means larger payout betting warren pay better 
also think right warren sanders candidates splitting progressive vote as one drops supporters flock whoever's left driving numbers 
progressive leftist suggesting bernie far left tend support progressives certainly warren 
please bring polling rigged fake news nonsense sub 
nope but think beneficial society let trump run around flame thrower destroying everything elect biden not matters win either way no matter many votes loses 
know gabbard soon connections bannon assad start getting air time going like lead balloon at least hope 
completely agree everything said actually yang supporter warren first choice big candidates always great see well both smart policy driven seem like nice people realistic polls currently 
exactly beto booker already candidates put crudely thing better young woke white guy black moderate suck oxygen campaigns yang unique selling point 
like yang there's excuse putting buttigieg in terms likeliest win nomination ones extreme long shots biden liz bernie harris pete yang's path everyone waking one day thinking ubi best thing since sliced bread 
while anything possible really think four dog race biden top then warren with bernie harris outside chance 
disagree this gambling accounts crazy turnarounds celebrating prediction market bad means nothing polls mean little stage still worth millions 
buy traders reading tea leaves like clinton allies networking twitter giving speeches sound vaguely stump biden's recent wobbliness etc plus fact filing deadlines run start passing october you read speculation comments dedicated market whether she'll https www predictit org markets detail will hillary president even higher odds currently larger dem nomination one 
honestly know by objective standard hillary one qualified person ever run president experience wise necessarily policy former first lady senator secretary state mind boggling resume so someone like lose reality show host made percent big mac grease suddenly realize measures matter people's feelings candidate mean kinda things along extent feel we've never post fact world remember popular general despite benghazi sideshow right wing boogeyman decided the media got whipped frenzy see happening biden since there's tons distract trashing democrat competing attention bernie get ton mainstream notice all say maybe fuzzy people associated obama might matters comes election day it's stupid teach demand substance much to credit warren really balances plan pages details wonks love here's believe worry i'll sweat resonates public maybe enough biden's nice old man shtick runs dry 
hillary chance lose biden's losing around 
that's objective fact polls cherry picked skewed 
accelerationism insane strategy the supreme court exists planet crisis for faults biden still leagues better trump crucial issues 
really https giphy com gifs town hall elizabeth warren ihjddm ovnwqa fullscreen 
maybe obviously think warren best strictly terms path presidency see gillibrand klobuchar even booker gabbard goes iran if everything focused foreign policy instead domestic scenario conversation switches sanders vs biden buttigieg debates happening side 
like yang lot regards met signed copy book cool respect hell puts policies anyone read what put warren camp way structured freedom dividend i'm interested idea ubi get nervous replacing social safety net funded vat the thing excites libertarians makes but that's really weeds overall good platform bit disappointed much opportunity talk think something add conversation 
but selling point people really buying if biden blows opens lot support like beto booker plus harris yang single issue candidate anything someone masses likely turn 
wait who's black moderate harris spent time senate leftward path i'd say booker's gimmick love wins marianne williamson better 
the thing prediction markets less efficient valuing low probability options like yang relatively high fees predictit mean betting winning nomination going give return course year whereas win would betting inefficient enough distort prices normally mid single digits 
think harris downward trend pete kind stagnant he pretty exclusively white crowd yang's presence growing suspect it'll start little exponentially primary cycle goes and precedented 
agreed high pete definitely chance i'd say gabbard probably put candidates ones mentioned 
i'm afraid might right that's said know realistic warren harris ticket one biggest reasons wanting biden still thinks work republicans you'd think learned eight years front row seat watching obama getting hand slapped back every time reached across aisle mcconnell biden's passed and far bernie better version but i'd okay winning nomination consolation price however there's long democrats hold primaries i'll hope least overtake left leaning independent gonna best help much 
celebrating anything full year convention months first vote bad the value things activists volunteers help keep fingers pulse community us focus efforts if prediction markers show sudden surge inslee gabbard de blasio think worth asking 
hmm good points and kind media sweetheart liberal side sadly expect left maybe that's wishful thinking 
it's really objective fact actually opposite 
accelerationism insane strategy mainly literally opposite posits happens every single time 
this definitely convince vote rather 
my point gabbard flying radar right ever rises prominence baggage glare media spotlight it'll sink campaign almost every single democratic candidate anti war only one associate steve bannon supports murderous dictator bashar assad 
believe buttigieg favorability voters color fine still pretty unknown he would take biden warren think start drop my guess plan let top candidates go attack eventually emerge consensus candidate get sick 
my major issue biden clearly slipping the guy makes sense seen action recently 
actually go check rcp's cherry picking 
the fact biden current frontrunner debunks accelerationism effective strategy 
you either child lair troll closet trump supporter plain crazy trying convince anything 
if can't answer allegations probably correct 
it's sad say today's world really think allegations hurt campaign rises prominence the reason would give better road nomination anyone polling outside top five she's good moments debates type democrat could see new hampshire voters 'defaulting' voting strong ground game nh 
from conversations way mishandled police shooting south bend tanked little trust credibility poc chance build really think hard time getting back 
it weak spot hate anything of black dems heard uncomfortable compared warren the candidates actually well voters biden bernie https www politico com id ef eaa

politics comments total shitshow there handful read today call bernie sexist doubt fox news running narrative likely bots trumpers stirring things vast majority attacks aimed warren claims campaign etc supporters cannot believe people fell hard it bound happen point but clear manufactured controversy misunderstanding benefit want progressive maga crowd because and sanders look bad non progressives ugh 
guys sanders supporter let fall please we goals warren bernie good friends if sanders wins hope see take prominent position cabinet even senate majority leader vice versa liz don let corporate media divide progressives this completely deliberate 
all people say warren campaign leaked idiots why would leak something purposefully try de escalate forced respond media it make sense 
the parnas documents released today show criminal enterprise running country let's focus voting save acrimony trump 
ask really benefits toxicity thread never would dreamed we'd two progressives leading polls this exciting time 
this whole thing bunch noise designed divide progressives 
personally know single bernie warren supporter fallen bullshit we support different people far none supporting friends i'm also buying 
i'm sure bernie right along tell people getting little tired olive branches coming mad edit this whole thing sen warren getting screwed man said something asked told truth it's abject campaign forced de escalate one ever taken course action attacking 
i'd love see warren sanders something like https www youtube com watch brbxckcviuc handshake photo op 
i'm going boycott cnn debate protest asinine hack manufactured drama reporting hope warren sanders supporters join 
that manufactured fight ridiculous i'm glad neither let cnn dominate instead turned woman absolutely become president sanders supporter get nomination hope warren 
so debate tonight elizabeth basically said bernie did tell woman win why would shut right stage wanted deescalate fight 
honestly makes clear leak come warren camp trying claim hate spin narrative made comment asked it want escalate 
yet plot script thickens https www politico com news sanders admits anti warren early states 
the main thing want see bernie campaign manufacturing scripts go liz say low level staffer big deal move it's campaign i'm pretty upset vote considered blue nomatter okay lead trailing 
bernie supporter coming peace really hope one actually believes sanders sexist thinks woman cannot president little sad warren pushes idea speak side argument starting corroborated 
really want believe bullshit ends campaign feels like kind would country mess 
donated weeks early spam exhausting 
well looks like bernie supporters judging video emerges sanders saying woman could elected president thread comments politics 
bernie supporter this manufactured nonsense there toxicity either side legitimate criticisms critique equal 
based tonight's performance de escalate though 
wish seen earlier fun watching people misunderstanding logic fallacies day 
i'm glad they're letting media manufacture fake rivalry warren's handling fine bernie's record clearly demonstrates he's sexist get wrapped type divisive mudslinging all blame goes corporate centrist establishment works tirelessly undermine progressives prop candidates serve agenda they reason trump got elected built reality tv obsessed campaign good business as sanders supporter would fool consider warren ally right certainly enemy definitely interest beefing supporters seeing agree everything she's policy genius we need people like government 
i'm sure either bernie warren win primary biden alone sanders supporter but together 
ignoring misogyny emboldens misogynists emboldening leadership opposite cowardice wrong and simply scarred berniebros makes right 
like bernie warren honestly situation leave good taste mouth regarding on surface seems people told story cnn day debate order gain traction polls refuses say much know primary politics get dirty really concerned sexist would brought immediately back also backing away somewhat help imo either still nuanced eloquent fan latest developments 
time warner want taxes raised 
yes same team whatever ballot vote they're better alternative 
wish nice attacked sanders supporters support warren 
warren supporter bernie tentative second when came cnn headline first thought way said added context mad interpreted comment lot us anxiety we saw happened pointing true things my opinion unchanged he sexist who people reddit twitter trashing elizabeth making assumptions hyperbolic claims twisting fit all divide it seems many online new voters politics plain learn lesson trying really hard let entire thing affect vote support vocal supporters last months years arguably especially treat opposing candidates female left feeling frustrated angry just man like candidate take another level and bots either case fence voting sanders primary drops know sure pushed edge made kind reconsider am wrong maybe thoughts welcome general blue matter obviously edit thanks thoughts guys definitely decision choice still make donate show indeed 
this came believe warren think right something fight meant woman shouldn president people turning said exactly reason bernie run automatic disadvantage 
there's zero chance said anything like think woman president discussing to fair never suggestion reporting 
i'm saying necessarily agree people believe implication discouraging warren run make room awhile think really important remember declared first makes look side eyed bunch shit issue knew had conversation announced like way if thinks highly align lot stuff wanted announce she started exploratory committee dec early feb he weeks later 
am supposed mad bernie shares sentiments there's zero chance said anything like think woman president discussing agree thought process irks response if conversation regarding issue trump attacking based gender diplomacy say something never intended come way im sorry friend elizabeth warren took wrong he stuck guns kept always angry old man attacks everyone schtick try diffuse combined day blaming staff low level volunteers instead taking slightest bit responsibility any candidate would least work closer going forward ensure doesnt happen campaign run blah it fault for fucks sake 
this ridiculous manufactured drama saying know woman win i'm worried she going clobbered sexist attacks statements it's ok most democrats ptsd we're living perpetual fear thought believe want reality misogyny still exists america the bar higher women think hillary clinton would exact platform record male assuming report true bernie likely said something along lines rather president man openly stated wanted decades ago and top warren nothing good things say even they're campaigning office type let slide bad whole debacle non issue unless says happened until excellent candidates i'll happily campaign either 
it's feasible bernie would say without sort unstated qualification context it sit values track record memory everyone thought woman win presidency you'd poor think 
there's zero chance said anything like think woman president discussing because that's exactly message come warren campaign moment campaigns dump opposition research file ahead vote you believe insinuation warren's okay 
run circles around trump debate stage there's gonna debates democratic nominee put mind can't control this going rallies 
warren doubled bernie saying say 
there's zero chance said anything like think woman president discussing except warren 
there's zero chance said anything like think woman president discussing well thinks win who believe that's there's discussion very simply it's impossible us know who's lying and one 
people going cnn spin borderline anti semitic former hillary folks seems entire thing cringe 
dude check twitter ridiculous manufactured yes berners eating unbelievable 
think best case scenario parties hope see right attempt divide progressive candidates 
this important feeling quote warren gave going ammunition bernie minority craving they back says something either defending elizabeth viewpoint acknowledging could perceived differently said still either way bad fire base really bummed story came time hoping online thing register ground guess find soon enough 
people falling per se lot bernie supporters even ones know real life hate warren they're likely jumping chance make look bad so many automatically disbelieved still got emboldened wapo article as another anonymous source anymore valid i'm saying sanders nice seem rarity 
yep best move far show we're better solidarity sanders supporting friend 
my best advice everyone see people attacking sanders warren remind trumps dirty work the winner promoting legitimate issue donald trump it takes away major news bombshells day like ukraine evidence came divides democrats 
honestly leak understand would confirmed story statement said the account conversation leaked contents inaccurate obscure real truth bernie allies always would easy put whole thing bed immediately 
all people say warren campaign leaked idiots seemed oddly coordinated i'd bet mostly driven russians us based troll farms gullible bernie supporters 
people make mistakes guess releasing dna test also backfired the folks sanders campaign made mistake recent anti warren scripts it strains credulity people coordinated behind back involved close orbit december she building truly historic conceivable decided sit vote whoever bernie liz ahead state votes this story start fight gone memory 
nate silver one idiots well 
well definitely come bernie's campaign nate silver https twitter com natesilver status said best 
because going negative often backfires you want opponents look bad candidate looking like they're hence people staff dirty work instead high minded 
because thought politically safe move got backlash 
it could better optics she able make bernie look worse without looking petty actually attacking what understand shake hand 
sure looks like working pretty sad seems changed americans still easily susceptible emotional manipulation until changes we'll always fall kind traps 
same range politically active friends support bernie warren buttigieg yang nobody know buying this manufactured garbage news 
bernie supporter spot love elizabeth could smell bs start 
she spent almost entire statement praising bernie calling sexist wants deescalate move the sexism charge stick fox news try push trump overt biden basically openly implied said warren open three weeks ago way staying power toxic reaction liners intensifies it is sucks thankfully seen lot supporters least understand ready 
absolutely spot bernie lot apologizing toxic stuff done campaign times yet every single thing warren gets scrutinized death media the implicit sexism coverage accepted default nauseating 
it exactly wanted released fake news story bernie instructing volunteers attack warren progressives fighting amongst 
this really higher think questions need answered clarify position 
hold breath he seems following pattern his cultists 
of course he address cnn question quick possible compliment warren look pivot toward biden social security it done inside seconds believe bernie cares issues veteran politician message 
bernie one smeared clearing name asking warren explain exact statement thinks supposedly said something yet 
isn't funny lots stories coming politico site well known anti bernie bias 
say low level staffer big deal move that's less said 
biden backs free public university tuition olive branch progressives 
lot making best enemy good thread do people want pull mainstream direction 
i'm saying stop pushing never say biden's moves last week greatly alleviated concerns he backs warren's bankruptcy plans decriminalization marijuana national minimum wage constitutional amendment end citizens united mean obviously going get everything want but nature progress this platform excited 
hi everyone putting article talks specifically policy warren cosponsored biden endorsing going forward from biden's plan mirrors sanders' college all act would make public college university tuition free whose families earn less per year that measure co sponsored two former contenders california sen kamala harris new york kirsten gillibrand woot glad see sanders weighing influence 
ok sorry everyone posted wrong link cnn sources support from biden official twitter account https com joebiden status www cnn politics joe biden free public university tuition index html the hill thehill homenews campaign says hell adopt plans sanders warren thanks face palm 
good good let policy flow 
this great rather always right attitude biden seems genuinely unite democratic party honestly know bernie still race everything looks like repeat at point seen response crisis actually courting progressive vote olive branches earned also support 
good honestly think accept nomination inevitable point the progressive plans programs promises adopt better it's going warren level excellence shift left slipping middle road river milquetoast received text campaign today asking vote responded saying voted liz glad endorsed warren's bankruptcy bill want see commitment agenda appointing women poc positions power volunteer said hearing lot biden looks forward working closely progressives he's certainly dream candidate least he's showing willingness adapt listen far 
want point hillary supported well 
this actually historically unusual usually presidential nominee go toward center 
he may always right buy believe meant would prefered lizzie sander's i'd ok seeing biden oval next year 
volunteered fund raiser biden attended around after event stump speech volunteers mostly college aged mentioned free personally felt kinda pandering sincere but give benefit doubt since entire party platform slowly shifting left 
hoping follows progressive policies worry since behind biden definitely 
mean gonna fight death sort legislation right is signalling 
excellent biden's recent moves making feel lot better progress might make becomes president it also tells he's serious winning disillusioned younger voters 
really wish picked universal childcare instead 
i'm graduate benefit little disappointing but think three nephews especially sister's kids probably afford college excited hopefully joe pushed 
that's quite leap actually find odd he's jumping bankruptcy let's talk filibuster court packing please also arresting trump because supreme court stop everything biden claiming supporting 
if really wants get young people vote promise legalize marijuana honestly unreliable voters might motivate butts basically bribe also good policy 
good want green new deal 
based lot comments political subreddits seems like progressives care actual policy want bernie warren exceptions not best approach trying get enact change it takes team individual one happy biden open ideas willing add already progressive platform especially clashed shows ability points view new information exactly things love much elizabeth things turn wanted time around least got likely nominee tons experience willingness listen people bring side record voters first choice going bitch tired bitching accept olive branch vote primary tomorrow november guy indications 
great what's gonna done student loans where's public service loan forgiveness promised signed loan paperwork does still count earned income tax purposes do loose years public service stafford instead direct 
that's nice all moderates like joe 
so get rid fluff degrees ensure people deserve college 
that argument wrote different thread hounded bernie bust comments 
you broke sanders campaign bare essentials 
think fair skepticism though it great see things platform joe really needs saying least behind closed doors going get work otherwise words when flip floppy marijuana issues makes hard believe actually fight policies move higher priority items agenda finally risks pleasing nobody tie progressive back brand one thing adopt warren bernie ideas make sure jive campaign message tacked order appease progressives if frightening moderates independents claims just two cents angered partial plan merely skeptical represent something biden 
they problem bernie's base years what wants exclusive club get members first it's turn never vote candidate people support their ability snatch defeat jaws victory truly remarkable when there's candidates race ones endorse fucking healing crystals lady deblasio you 
joe biden senator mbna reaching left education bankruptcy issues it's fucking great warren deserves lot credit running campaign detailed truly intelligent policy made sort thing palatable wider spectrum democratic base we collectively chose wrong think real good moderating hillary bernie schism 
we want extreme climate action single payer healthcare this good best thing could offered the loan damage done us loan forgiveness finding way bring cost would far better 
and progressives miss progressive platform lifetime to get would gigantic step forward pretty far left vast majority country 
he backs warren's bankruptcy plans decriminalization marijuana national minimum wage constitutional amendment end citizens united that's 'now' other plan issues website entire campaign 
and let real we know progressive pushing charge get left behind scenes it old man yelling tv right 
the problem minimum wage movement time finally gets passed outdated high enough make difference any increased needs set stone annual increase keeps inflation that way dont national bullshit nothing 
realize backed decriminalizing marijuana these good i'd like see progress climate change anti corruption wealth tax would moon joy 
tbf biden supported former stuff entirety campaign 
just give universal healthcare got confidence 
the online contingent realised bernie path closed seeing lot effort push people vote rd party these olive branches helpful majority rational progressives always minority want feel exceptionally pure elect trump affirm accelerationist marxist transitional theory not sure downvote liberally 
it encouraging see changed positions bankruptcy bill change college tuition much it's basically hillary's position while think unreasonable income limits place taxpayers paying donald trump's kids go school hillary put wish biden adopted warren's plan cancel student loan debt 
honestly know bernie still race everything he's trying focus platform biden use push progressive that's and that's good thing progressives damaging point he's forcing left think problem look idiot run getting wing matters even though young turks turn plenty needs consolidate making everyone thinks trump go 
he drop tonights debate soon therafter exactly compromises like hrc made lot concessions paid compaigning effort too bad get wisocnsin michigan pa buy 
honestly know bernie still race everything looks like repeat we can't sure either way consider possibility college tuition thing might happening already 
never thought i'd see people begging empty campaign promises politicians lol 
true least know would sign congress passed intervene water nothing outside maybe hr giving daca people clear quick path citizenship getting done without abolishing filibuster anyway unless plan pick one major thing year budget reconciliation guess 
legitimate concern guess better nothing i'll believe see 
it's us vote ticket with house senate picture look different 
yeah see good thing i'm overly excited feel like biggest positive action warren would presidency big platform items even biden difficult time getting free tuition congress definitely less dedicated making sure passes get watered it emphasis 'personnel policy' underlying structural changes likely want touch 
agree next needs forgive undergraduate student loans fair otherwise like decriminalizing marijuana releasing people previous convictions you retroactively apply policies imo 
they bail wall street trillion sorry can't pay ur old loans god hate government sometimes 
he detained south africa simply misspoke corrected later 
know medicare super important one issue voter see lot value politician moderate biden starts vocally supporting ideas if nominee way define democratic party especially president so idea others like become new normal democrats great thing imagine health care shortly follow possibly likely imo time tell we take win come back ask elizabeth warren 
covid imo showing solution though ultimately overarching policy what show need competent executive branch even fully working right would nothing stop spread pandemic considering called hoax weeks competent leadership setup touch multiple agencies inside federal govt ever obama administration we let us talk cure case italy uk like systems dealing 
dude countries bad outbreaks universal health care the differences government populace reacted universal healthcare great overcome westerns radical individualism 
biden already supports universal healthcare so hillary every democratic candidate race single payer way get ask half countries europe achieved without getting rid private insurance 
he supports getting universal healthcare incremental changes repeat form 
washingtonian think coronavirus really need worry this stuff wild getting hit hard people support medicare save lives voting blue matter history shown era's progressivism typically follow terrible crisis 
he public option italy universal healthcare they lockdown right if sanders plan makes private insurance illegal stuff like donald trump would currently charge solve 
despite overwhelming funding lead sanders utterly failed energize voters chance winning nomination but somehow i'm supposed believe biden desperate one lol 
because education selling labor improving self understanding world 
yea need ignore grown ups progressive wing there absolutely way moderate centrist establishment figures like biden enacting policy fantastic news progressives everywhere this always dragging country left cannot teleport people new location physically drag point means passing every left leaning position along that's the fight 
they probably russian bots bernouts 
you massively generalized diverse group individuals one crude generalization 
i'm sorry sort generalization better attacks side you're making things worse 
definitely get blunt right choice modest improvements biden four years hell trump know i'm picking 
his plan halves income based repayments discretionary makes forgiven amount untaxable and believe make loan interest paused that would student loans much affordable many people 
unless he's making empty promises win soon wins walks back it's nice hear believe see 
yes mean imply positions adopted last week something although but moment part policy proposals apologize stated clearly 
well bit due he yell awful loud 
go limb say pragmatic progressive gets sh done like cpfb instead performative populist yells things nothing 
yuuuup it's hilarious sad long we've fighting minimum wage remained completely stagnant same thing happen pass always years behind 
hope legislation built raise inflation 
he's adopting bernie's bill plan campaign 
understand concern warren bernie plan presidential campaigns but step right direction speaks influence progressives moderate like joe biden 
removed rule also refers sanders' college all act https www sanders senate gov newsroom press releases college act introduced 
removed rule also bernie's plan indeed include income qualifier 
don worry most show vote anyway 
surprised future think can't adopt million progressive policies without alienating moderate side we need unite party covid shown us anything get trump our economy going take dive see find way forgive student loan debt federal loans without people able stay afloat thank god warren senate push things 
mean hillary positions pretty progressive despite bernie camp would believe she championed universal healthcare ever that said think student loan forgiveness hard sell lot reasons for one college benefits form earning potential afford get double whammy make less got education loans forgiven so fair chose family personal circumstances made plus saved pay tuition others kids rewarded how families paid not mention worked in opinion simpler fairer option give sum money credit used towards you use 
if promises pay student loans i'm aboard biden train month wife's we afford thankfully know also we'd putting back economy the stimulus peers would immense 
sanders opened four field offices pa vote six weeks everyone saying he's going drop debate tuesday's votes fooling he stayed months past viability he's setting thing care democratic party stopping trump i'm half convinced wants biden lose told everybody like completely ignore contributed defeat run age 
he exactly compromises like stop lying pride voterbase if really wanted make would dropped supported elizabeth warren heart attack

so question keep seeing bernie supporters pushing narrative warren somehow centrist corporate shill closet republican whatever and course sizable outspoken chunk what benefit trying cut get passionate that's great he's solid candidate would love vote ge but others think better make attack there's little attacks sub probably realise similar ticks lot boxes us probably also recognize takes nomination need why bring board well 
then changing fundraising policies general election secretary clinton outspent trump how accepting donations bad economic actors unilateral disarmament primary campaign cleaner intends take money wins nomination i'm supporter donor stated position leaves sour taste mouth 
i'm gonna piss hard laughing bernie gets nomination holds donor meetings never swore 
i'm fine auditing wealthy every year if that's price pay mil lifestyles sure they'll you're really exaggerating difficulty assessing wealth the vast majority assets united states' tied investments closely open market easy put value gaap accounting also evaluate rare specialty goods art wine collections last sale proposed current there's tricky stuff warren plan includes assumption percent applicable tax revenue missed like it's harassment irs damn job 
historically speaking wealth taxes effective people would hope primarily impossible determine value things like art jewelry wine collections forms generate tax reports unless auditing wealthy every year auditing suspicion harassment expensive literally none correct this and part great example putting cart horse things way around edit to expound cut needlessly aggressive phrasing early sue wealth indeed failed europe popular 's but cause little difficulty appraising property fact already quite well appraise real rather couple confounding factors made europe's ineffective they low threshold the started range consider upper middle class meaning small businesses marginally populations felt crunch narrow bases essentially opposite said true fail hard so families could easily move exempt categories simply others transfer assets got shafted eu agreements make easy europeans resettle internationally desired pack country amenable structure now legitimate concerns they're precisely warren's plan structured address surtax we're safely broad base assessment again appraisals succeed us different position it much harder abroad expatriate addition they've put forward exit propose funding toward enforcement code focus high ensure minimal avoidance rate tough prosecutions evasion 
funny town seems problem implementing wealth tax property sure house undervalued due housing market still collecting something get total difficult evaluating single may work perfectly mean we could start looking paid said art jewelry etc 
hate wealth tax feel good policy would encourage unpatriotic ultra wealthy finally bite bullet become americans pay one time fat exit they still indirectly profit usa like european friends having dissolve assets keep paying bills great way reduce value people change makeup it may better hold financial instruments instead property the ramifications persistent sweating i'm nowhere near enough affected think best big shakeup though controversial since fear occurring convenience substantially negative

the fact willing read use brain scares lol wonder date house senate actually muller report

these rich people get generous why would give it defies logic 
https www nytimes com us politics elizabeth warren html 
there's effort drive wedge warren bernie supporters we're team 
people passionate bernie they're ideology behind does warren's policies sound better democrat last years yes necessarily mean need her meeting clinton bode well if progressive clinging clinton's embodiment kind needs retire desire maintain capitalist system promising things correlate the inherit mechanisms create massive systems inequality corruption concentration power these would short lived aside economics capitalism destroying planet survive must dismantle mistakes past seem evident warren things says ring obama turncoat say least and rings hillary not leans towards center fact support sees niche demographic she speaks older educated wealthy white liberals that's going cut this could change cause concern corporate media gravitating raises large red flag again hillary's two public private i'm saying but combine like tendencies cozying another faced neoliberal fatal bottom line transition away best option he's one brought actual social class true sense since lbj so policy choosing lighter options 
because running general expensive primary we expect decent chance recall vote one state she need sizable war chest make 
auditing people every year absence evidence kind wrongdoing harassment in addition audits take years complete would absolutely cause backlog work irs prevent pursuing committing real crimes 
the wealthy simply shift investment things cannot tracked this policy substantial problems

because see system broken trust fix 
have seen top donors it's mainly universities show biggest donation regular corporation 
yes there's reason bernie warren refuse attack movement champion important fall squabbling 
yeah effort coming directly bernie campaign people like sirota 
her desire maintain capitalist system promising things correlate sanders wants he never calls abolition capitalism policies predicated upon existence thriving private sector support sees niche demographic hillary lot us the largest number supporters biden warren split people backed last time source https fivethirtyeight com features forget lanes democratic primary whole freaking transit she speaks older educated wealthy white liberals no poll qu edu national release detail releaseid quinnipiac whether would excited one dems became nominee black voters white democrats college degree 
but none evident you're vastly overreaching provide evidence and truly passionate ideology behind bernie wouldnt happy see another candidate supporting many policies wealth tax anti corruption bill climate expanding social security could go fact warren senate relatively short amount time in unprecedented gop obstructionism helped found lead cfpb getting back literally billions us citizens greedy corporations she attacked tarp helping banks instead people actually needed help wealthy wall street donors scared might win thing get supporters undermine why would want attack agrees vast majority certainly much like say going needs warren's do think attacking two faced liar convince come you realise rhetoric divisive work far better ever 
her meeting clinton bode well why what talk 
how much expensive and honestly as stated senator clinton outraised spent trump she lost general all money world get michiganders wisconsinites come believe corner easiest way prove taking problematic actors imho success bernie sanders necessarily progressive policy stances it calling corrupt system popular fundraising attempt circumvent corruptive influence warren fantastic currently she's even side eyeing unions i'm super pro labor admit grown large unwieldy bureaucracies actually mean anything publicly stating timeline includes eventually money claims corrupting policies competitors primary that's reason candidate sour mouth taste remains 
yeah i'd like imagine greedy capitalists read writing wall they know economy needs ultimately need but can't bring first movers needed changes not without real threat old way life more trump would keep going doom crash hard remove perverse incentives government regulation kid vaccines 
who said corporatist certainly comment money corrupting influence everybody knows including senator warren that's reason taking money holding fundraisers primary what understand suddenly becomes less problematic general election if reproach may well start because looks bad particularly popular stance sanders launched campaign statement corrosive modern fundraising within party in hands best candidate she's even large union insistence ideas smart campaigning enough pull big part makes preferred it make sense celebrate believe win elections without unsavory age climate income inequality crises downright dangerous actors how critical people take moment secured nomination it's optics problem something adequately addressed 
she also proposes funding irs paid revenue tax able handle increased job demands 
let's fund irs it's criminally underfunded anyway and one best returns funding government agency auditing require evidence wrongdoing that would like closing stable door horses gone calling harassment really silly the wealthy disproportionately benefit society make take time ensure they're playing fair least

there's reason think would different this looks like coopted bernie's idea show shy aggressive taxes though seems wealth tax applied known timeframe energize short term investment 
well thing really like making seem saying big money political optics primaries go right back soliciting general it's good look understand having necessarily better hillary showed us think she'd lot gain firmly holding high ground one

why what talk think moment you're talking behind closed doors someone lost trump consider public's opinion clinton even innocent pay high price 
it us hard project depends many districts states recount could easily run tens millions dollars 
that change time factor if audit people every year backlog forming quickly 
agree need fund irs audits expensive person audited if audit every year forcing retain attorneys accountants it absolutely harassment 
here igm forum take exact proposal please pay specific attention third question refers alternatives http www igmchicago org surveys wealth taxes it seems like economists polled think would difficult enforce likely better choices there seem general agreement properly enforced top see less views potential benefits 
it simple how would legally stop someone buying painting lots wine auction your entire idea already impossible 
anytime buy something establish value thing yes values change adds complexity imply taxing ownership somehow means outlaw stupid harder mean impossible things gain lose time especially collectables if assessing someone wealth needs accurate you prevent people buying store harder trace would involve banning purchase goods general literally suggested punishing we tax everyone audit previous returns suggest honest

dude shes from harvard you expect someone professor place like run president institution not support same mit association i'm doubting use lot financial investments drive wealth know that's happening really big bad education that's big concern today sorry follow 
i'm still waiting corporate donor give sweet citation sugarpop 
that article current affairs really ticked supposed intellectual attacking sen warren gut feeling 
sure feel free point meaningful differences don call trojan horse corporate shill write screed gut feelings say warren traitor like editor current affairs that kind talk pushes people away bernie 
warren eight conditions argues placed corporate bailout including minimum wage three year ban dividends executive bonuses 
like especially permanent ban stock buybacks 
this part love sen warren much she understands game corporate executives play heads win tails taxpayers lose and call put stop far many democrats afraid calling corruption fear it'll make next election harder but makes us look facile republicans turns smart people politics entirely why care both parties pocket big business anyway setting rules road company wants taxpayer dollars sense hell know ton would precisely shows serious us money if airlines need better earn 
that would amazing attached corporate bailouts 
really like idea ban executive bonuses i'm sure dividends lots retired folks rely pay bills 
can run is primary ing incumbent president thing 
i'm calling senator tomorrow try get consider backing plan also vote earn it act https www wired com story earn act sneak attack encryption 
moot favorite rule employees get permanent seat board germany much better relationship labor capital 
nationalization no public money without ownership if taxpayers invest save see returns airlines bounce back airlines general essential utilities treated many countries including europe publicly owned one point 
damn wish nominee vote general would biden backbone make demands 
yesss what best way help rally support the stock buyback thing infuriating 
pls pls no fucking buybacks 
eli what exactly stock buybacks 
kind stuff the candidate wall street friends afraid much bernie ideology knows shit worked directly life 
biden needs pick anti corruption plans 
if going president kind need badly senate 
unfortunately vast majority stockholders individuals ban dividends would negatively affect small minority people half seniors even stock positive effect much larger portion society increasing likelihood public corporations spend irresponsibly that said federal aid stimulus especially might absolutely table 
feels like two separate points banning ceo bonuses recieving relief funds makes sense not paying dividends receiving extending years also good blueprint changing rules game requiring worker representation board company beyond certain size core progressive goal 
she'd younger everyone still race 
biden already said hes running whoever vp walk strongest argument it needs warren imo 
she absolutely gonna need progressive kick biden bernie old likely retiring way open take 
basically company spends money reaquire stock market they literally buy publicly traded back it generally effect inflating price generating new value society workers execs love since compensation often comes backs easy way make personally the vast majority tax rejiggering gave corps went buybqcls 
looking financials airlines yesterday interesting things take american airlines https finance yahoo com quote aal cash flow example they ended fy cash end period also spent stock buybacks common repurchased divedends assets debt the big number sticks negative stockholder's equity last two years points overvalued overleveraged even i'm ranting cyclical business need hand weather market cycles overextended short term benefit shareholders 
when company starts buying shares back making private upsides include paying dividends fewer shareholders boosting key metrics like earnings share useful masking flat sorry know eli 
biden needs pick something cabinet 
noooooo people keep saying it keeps getting amplified bots the senate graveyard visionaries you want liz biggest microphone get hands seat main table brown would step replace voice capable she killed larry summers lifelong dream running fed floor never even publicly denounce nomination think transform veep role 
right rather see majority leader flipped senate 
yeah love bernie run think warren would he done lot spear head progressive cause endorsed campaigned could faulting anyone choices player video game guys playable characters tactic for better worse progressives divided primary the good part debates multiple people advocating medicare going billionaires made seem like solid position nuance not one crazy loner yelling caring working class corporations bad house wish ran she beat hilary imagine white house instead trump right hope biden picks vp if team aware political land scape must know please it well known states refuse need two old white men picking symbolic olive branch actually get stuff everyone saying unity democrats picking help 
iirc buybacks used illegal least considered bad practice back 
to fair thats short term long allow company future reissue stock raise money needs it doesnt want dilute market 
how vp better visionaries name one visionary played substantial role altering administrations path well cheney suppose let model the attack dog administration liz could goals policies they rightly fall line president seen pulling strings contrarian think become also sec treasury know talk legally fill roles 
my understanding became vp republican would put place since role appointed ma governor member gop apparently special election process taking white house means nothing senate seats also believe biden already told needed 
like veep bc would logical choice next line democrat clearly large influence policy fit biden could go either way 
know people really want going happen beyond seniority issue first actually win back senate as much trust biden think warren would able take many responses date views president also doubt transform role vp finally let put way stop promoting banking remote possibility become majority leader 
to fair shell game time 
vice president charge foreign domestic policy 
due biden age vote potentially next presidents that want pick warren vp still get see liz office years would full backing party think 
liz man uvre anything close cheney power uses good biggest win progressives could get presidency seeing primary long way go point the vp traditionally seen nothing mouthpiece yes since elizabeth career politician warren cared tradition rather least one progressive room biden cabinet citigroup picks proven history pulling strings without drawing attention string think everyone massively underestimating based ineffectual men veeps automatic frontrunner believe would better president anyone else list especially moment want heartbeat away simple calculation 
saying cheney powerful visionary vp bit like saying michael bay influential auteur filmmaker it's completely true still feel dirty acknowledging 
think one thing consider biden admin interested term he real people wanted get trump sees time placeholder prop next candidate he's already committed woman vp could use cred progressives the downside warren vs kamala demographic 
mean woman created entire government entity sheer force holding kind office if named vp would absolutely redefine role dream 
ma special election process they also democratic supermajority force appointment think biden wants pick either someone challenge much imo anything would change depression 
think would accept vp position biden see world condition resign jan 
mean let's face facts super healthy year old runs around like twenty something erudite brain compassion empathy mission worker also completely grounded reality would better nominee you thought other people but can't beat trump i'm really sad president should she's need moment crisis going want effective 
removed rule no bust talk vote rbg fucking retire nothing else

to quote elizabeth the people former life rising stars public service donald trump's prison 
know katie porter i'm curious 
and that's going fb feed all i'm seeing pete ugh this country needs teacher chief 
even though interesting factoid also explain distrust americans institutions namely exclusive social club understand like think ivy league law schools pinnacle meritocratic success but concerned precedent political class educated the standard elite people drafting implementing policy imports lot blind spots allowed growing wealth income inequality alienate half country 
to mostly says representatives made ivy league entirely pro higher education anti if attended prep school dad alum business representing interests average american 
anyone know names edit katie porter john cotton joe kennedy 
katie porter two took classes in graduate setting kinda different student word implies kind deep research mentorship intended anyone hls period years taught important giant metric crazy general statement case at least academia part someone person trusted enough allow join group publish 
and thought political memes funny 
to fair taught harvard law school basically politician factory 
thought used teach special ed they must democrats 
this really good podcast episode talking teaching experience https gimletmedia com shows cut tuesdays emh also article accompanied www thecut elizabeth warren teacher presidential candidate html 
read fighting chance it's memoir talks whole life election senate 
have ever seen legally blonde apparently elle's first teacher based warren 
katie porter also one coauthors fabulous bankruptcy law textbook the law debtors creditors fyi 
katie porter tom cotton two 
tom cotton joe kennedy katie porter 
true especially since many ivy students they're legacies got best brightest family members went school 
can't speak works law i'm phd clinical psychology would say students entire faculty teaches courses mentee supervisee advisee pi direct supervisors obviously latter important relationship i've deeply influenced lot taught classes 
taking classes someone makes student only imply deep relationship taken one class law professor multiple every though contracts con either those important well 
tom one he clearly turned horribly rottenly bad apples bunch 
ugh fuck guy ive never yelled radio louder listening interview david axelrod 
video questioning snap form today amazing 
think head cfpb warren president 
pretty cool unbeknownst anyone three would eventually become senators 
thank as huge elizabeth warren supporter imagine good teacher leader democratic party everything fighting the ironic thing find republican many blue moons ago it proof grow adapt time meant 
aware think politics exclusive domain lawyers know handful politicians business medicine needs backgrounds represented require advanced professional degrees for instance although time period materially different new deal faults planners social workers accountants tradespeople these people really involved political decision making anymore 
matt gaetz went william mary someone really hoping get law fact always hurts 
yeah bristle labeling people took warren classes students in graduate settings accurate restrict description research person mentorship this would things katie porter 
think missing larger point you dismiss numbers members congress went ivy league schools say hey less ten percent but realize consensus around politicial economy relating foreign policy economics incubated institutions tanks adjacent the neoliberal good people disastrous others my main critique in order advance conform orthodoxies these usually pro market austerity intervention coming end perpetuating norms government without pushback called genius expertise we need diverse backgrounds fully represent interests americans 
it really got charged election i'm also recommending all your worth younger folks starting life useful us older coots well 
she narrates audiobook that's double score 
yep but even admits warren great professor 
big enough structural bailey sit 
well one the two became representatives 
and fair republican party even anything like quasi fascist monstrosity today back newt gingrich might seen weird disappointing aberration sign things come 
definitely see saying agree need diverse backgrounds congress that one reasons think aoc story inspiring lot people reflected for though warren history professor viewed part elite social club come background she busted ass going non colleges daughter janitor oklahoma rise level country prestigious university statement achieved like boss teach privileged thing two 
we ask doctors backgrounds medicine engineers engineering our lawmakers lawmaking why law degree absolute requirement political office you interests skills besides legislators obviously listen concerns solutions academics best handle issues society faces done empirical research social workers tradespeople accountants someone going writing laws know works the qualification knowing jd 
ugh matt gaetz worst best wishes acceptance letter coming way though 
fun fact elizabeth reads letter end audiobook version all your worth lady texas full blown accent you hear voice might've sounded like stayed oklahoma brothers thicker accents

elizabeth great wife year old rainbow appeared came speak an omen 
texas flipping blue general election 
https twitter com farrellgabriell status 
like warren mayor pete hope ticket order 
wow warren people austin event trump inauguration 
bernie bird warren double rainbow biden gaffe 
inb bernies crowds bigger lol 
wow might start pulling crowd's size bernie's soon edit understand come across snide like candidates wanting point interesting momentum seems swinging towards warren 
heard double rainbow https twitter com thomaskaplan status 
there several polls showing democrats beating trump texas poll https static univision com especiales noticias infografias encuesta septiembre national texas poll pdf 
that dream ticket you could flip flop either position would still fantastic pete liz smart people sensibly cover left side political spectrum they different overall policies confident 
same though also mind abrams vp ticket 
even though believe god nice think almost trying give us sign right direction 
shall slightly meow group giraffes called tower 
it's pretty bad coming candidate's subs stir shit is hint desperation smell 
think came across snide tried imagine 
double rainbow all the way across skyyy 
great pic from vantage point near trees noticed second rainbow really stunning evening rain let sun shining west scattered storm clouds got hear compelling message actually heard full stump speech fantastic communicator dare say felt hopeful rare feeling since told daughter may looking next president united states 
it absolutely afraid get rained instead nice backdrop 
damn i've never seen double rainbow wish saw rainbows often they're beautiful life really magical 
hopes would abso fucking lutely amazing 
one issues types polls early pick lot reliable gop voters 'weighing options' 'unsure candidate' always end going closer election day gets especially learn democratic candidate 
warren abrams would powerhouse ticket 
bernie pulls biggest crowds how stirring shit congratulate warren starting catch edit alright supporters petty buttheads noted wish could get along closer two candidates 
sorry there must like ppl lol 
believe every voter allowed exercise right vote properly counted texas flip blue but knowing kind suppression skullduggery gop engages saw first hand ga cynical prospect 
yeah probably happening considering voter suppression count democratic party would put lot resources combat there story couple days ago many voting locations closed since supreme court fucked vra upwards believe 
think that's true cycle kamala harris got announcement bernie held anything large warren's seattle event she's par crowds time period though https www washingtonpost com politics paloma trailer elizabeth warren big matter fa bb edit taste fart pointed pulled couple rallies similarly 
rupaul's drag con sent blessing 
that's probability works with chance winning hillary simulated elections meaning trump if sure thing would say we came across one instances defies let's also forget changed comey's memo 
that polls fault though shitty media narrative probably ended helping trump win 
that's fair point reasonable say models shit however fivethirtyeight website nate silver runs pretty good job imo their model trump chance winning roughly legitimate in addition got election correct predicted every single state correctly so i'd recommend look predicting track record compared competition 
these odds analysis give human exists without bias analysts want trump win while bit foolish taking polls gospel treat votes cast right find much punditry it equally completely disregard snap shots country if would've gotten reporting hillary frighteningly close way closer ever 
get everyone sub angered probably bernie's crowd sizes larger the article mention even interesting choice but last weekend example bernie warren's estimated this denver austin necessarily fair comparison maybe liberal idk 
why would compare cities crowds smaller seattle was rally included 
that would impressive crowd size meant anything 
compared ones happened last weekend he drew san francisco https www mercurynews com bernie sanders san francisco rally california mueller report la heavy news los angeles turnout la crowd 
no yeah absolutely right it mean anything nate silver wrote good peice https fivethirtyeight com features dont let crowd sizes mislead 
and weight population cities warren's impressive anyway dick size measuring contest crowd stupid bernie warren trying bring support progressivism holding rallies they pulling strong crowds 
noted i've added edit higher response 
cool genuinely curious crowd sizes compare average i've mostly heard bernie's does subreddit keep track warren's events if want see list one moderators sandersforpresident keeps https docs google com spreadsheets tsk ubltjcbtpr nn imotdvwmo ra kxcjo my 
cool tracking spreadsheet we mostly note big ones make news the st paul seattle got people start noticing common comment speculating long selfie line must including posting sub multiple times waiting think something like hours these events turning lines introductory campaign speech

i'm honestly tired someone mentioning sexism every warren post know there's truth becoming meme her supporters one already mocked scapegoating if obama became president name skin like floating around people vote woman think holds enough weight mentioned much 
know sexism per se bernie treated way last go around was due anti semitism or progressivism centrism would argue latter 
it shows people like policies nothing sexism stop victim the problem candidate giving detailed policy statements gives something attack no platform please every single voter that candidates resist saying anything specific ew become lightening rod early debates one presented debatable position she defensive good look especially many view crazy old lady 
think ok post discuss article 
she needs talk working mom experiences debates that's base party it answers question which candidate trust care fight people like 
and real https www washingtonpost com politics time magazine trump cover hangs golf clubs fake adf de ba story html

elizabeth warren i'm surprised someone running democratic nomination thinks economy would better let banks overtly racist we need confront shameful legacy discrimination lie like mike bloomberg done 
bloomberg's recent polling numbers disgust everyone everyone debate stage needs destroy elizabeth best position bring righteous anger passion grills big bank ceos trump appointed administrators 
want see body every possible opportunity debate care nyt writes editorials strident voice needs gutted she opposed everything stands make blindingly obvious her entire reason running end corruption embodies on note challenge bernie biden pete no amy bs either makes look viable though think benefit actively going unlike others 
i'm hoping everyone takes shots bloomberg absolutely despise hes gotten polling 
if recent tweets indication feisty campaign approach we're going treat next debate either she'll dragged mud media mean even though opponents times nasty throughout entirety campaigns guess we'll wait see 
love much why common sense candidate every single person like country headed 
what referring want fact based arguments make bloomberg especially ones centering around race family african american 
michael bloomberg championed incredibly racist 'stop frisk' policy and get gave pat toomey pa million campaign contributions he reason republicans hold senate majority kavanaugh dozens unqualified federal judges bench well every horrible bit republican legislation became law 
bloomberg debate stage warren's wet dream no one able destroy quite thoroughly 
warren dream would bloomberg stage punch 
are allowed attack bloomberg sub consider democrat think deserves protected rules 
sort get bloomberg's deal lived nyc mayor republican even donald trump republican nominee bloomberg went campaigning republicans help gop maintain majority abused merrick garland enable so work hard put people place come back around feign surprise consequences actions smacks disingenuousness that said think mr deserve debate stage his commercials great way americans going see he's nearly advertising 
that' girl go get liz 
she's right warren gonna getting support going bloomberg the kind people like unlikely back someone they he's moderate explicitly imo she'd much better bernie that's voters shared ideology it's also campaign likely steal votes liz 
it's obvious bloomberg's priorities literally said the healthier banks economy https www businessinsider sg bloomberg wall street donald trump in conversation bloomberg news editor chief john micklethwait morgan stanley ceo james gorman started describing would running president 'i defend particularly good strategy get elected country today business magnate 'but desperately need group willing take risks make money finance growth com news videos michael james gorman long term thinking

need bloomberg warren sanders left right flanks debate show wearing bib brandishing knife fork 
everyone debate stage needs destroy elizabeth best position bring righteous anger passion grills big bank ceos trump appointed administrators she far strongest comes holding wall street account 
this meme summarizes feelings https imgur com mzf iy 
she need directly call candidates flaws way klobuchar pete going offensive always risky ex wine cave moment needs initiate make look like competent qualified candidate stage 
wanna see liz eviscerate competition like eviscerates republican lackeys committee hearings that's love want leader 
she absolutely best going directly wealthy people her rise polls earlier cycle coincided nicely debate sparring john delaney 
yessssssss please liz her best debate moments senate grills into wealthy la john delaney goldman sachs ceos this next going perfect opportunity bring fire given public adoration also totally focus horrible politics bloomberg hope also ties wealth completely tied wall street maybe built predatory trading exact knowledge terminals corresponding technology may added financial crisis sure something 
me he's gotten entirely ads time debates that's place challenged anyone else no one except possibly bernie campaign cash take via even dwarfs bernie's available ad money i'll glad everyone stage makes explain prior policies got race thinks win he's smart rest half dozen belt campaigning year they're primed 
according nh exit polls voters said warren negative candidate race putting second behind biden know look campaign decide without misogyny agree assessment vacuum worry getting feisty make turn away women allowed being makes men tough women bitchy 
i'd rather see go fighting fade background silly unity messaging hope comes guns blazing nv debate she get exchange every one candidates bloomberg bernie make case sucks easy take biden's bankruptcy fight pete's meaningless platitudes would far effective president and please amy stuff if making hard sell point surprised already single digits time super tuesday rolls around 
if recent tweets indication feisty campaign approach we're going treat next debate it seems like candidates ignored bloomberg part hopefully moderators ignore dollar signs jobs asking tough questions bernie liz eviscerate 
dont give fuck media thinks she needs body slam competition 
think https apnews com cbb fafbb faf 
here's video remarks referring https twitter com anandwrites status 
from new york times fact check https www nytimes com us politics bloomberg stop frisk html after mr bloomberg took office number recorded stops increased sevenfold nyclu org en data high according police department compiled civil liberties union in last year mayor police decline percent peak increase first years stopped black latino 
it's downright misleading imply system destabilized banks cant discriminate based race risks going might lead higher costs even guarantee your reasoning shortsighted backing loans certain minorities creates self fulfilling cycle people never able escape poverty become contributors economy the point bloomberg elected official represent 
yeah get people pissed changed rules bloomberg onto stage without firehose carefully selected manicured version entire country rebuttal this way warren sanders absolutely tear billionaire oligarch buying nomination 
swear exact dream two nights ago 
need bloomberg warren sanders left right flanks debate yeah box stand look destroys 
vote blue matter bloomberg would biggest hold nose vote though 
fuck yes ever it's trump opposition party smarter callous he can't nominee 
needs go offence yes get sexist commentary people seem think bulldog beat trump it worked amy the best way without falling wine cave trap probably going records factual possible no metaphor voting legislative pivot better policy 
she use bloomberg stand trump next week he basically 
would love see thought clinton she kept carefully manicured persona let loose loss came across far fiery relatable agree everything said targeted course think warren benefit showing fire she's reserved important leveling criticism dem candidates criticizing bloomberg though gloves he's democrat he's oligarch 
really appreciate amount work goes making comment like think sub right place we try inviting every candidate that quite pointedly attack one politics neutral ground subs better kind good luck but remember end nomination process need come together go trump if wound much hurt 
get also think going negative matter might well kick ass mean that's got us interested first place good 
that's insane poll she nicest one 
she choice ran hufflepuff campaign based far qualified candidate best plans trying avoid misogyny web failed with bloomberg looming fade background calm competence getting voters 
i'm almost comes bernie non dem voters got vote primary know lot supporters feel his loudly booed cursed chanted candidates speeches new hampshire dinner pretty blatant as well votes nh independents intention voting trump general liz demo which see good thing 
it wine cave bernie meeting she generally positive anyone got sucked two stories choice talk people clear stuck very frustrating especially thinks woman win story fully believe campaign wanted part 
that white ass nh she either gotta fight going fade obscurity 
keep mind perspective sanders buttigieg nh supporters would take criticism candidate especially hard she called get defensive it kinda natural current political environment not going deny misogyny factor think team mentality may specific situation 
agree except going bernie yes know would infinitely effective academic administration go ally left race we need progressive unity come convention likely win if like way warren supporters often treated treat want respect candidate shares policy platform ideals 
wow fuck guy and democratic unity held elected office republican clearly one heart 
pretty sure ascribing something say there factors sometimes correlate race necessarily directly determine yet cannot used may adversely affect certain groups racial otherwise even valid result based purely risk profile fair point banks duty subsidize expense customers or programs address it debatable also fair though bank employees shareholders depend stable financial system people well 
being debate stage gives legitimacy deserve 
they putting ringer without legitimizing candidacy the party moderating leading debates tbh letting media run gives leverage gin horse race bullshit stoke conflict shedding light just look klobuchar well debate surges and then start vetting it completely backwards if runs require people go process qualify tell ones pound sand 
honestly know would vote situation saying lot after listening audio leaked talked stop frisk believe genuinely racist might write third party really consider believed things improve marginalized people president 
exactly like need another billionaire new york white house because worked well 
yeah would think pretty hard imo bloomberg like smarter trump better ways much worse others edit ways he's overtly racist misogynistic tv blunder way national security crises he'd gun control addressing climate change he organized subtle continuing benefit wealth expand systematic racism neutral he'll still prioritize corporate interests 
he get vote bloomberg effective version trump racist he's republican cares corporations human beings i'd honestly rather at least congress still spend every day obstructing cooperating 
mood stable savvier version trump hide lying no thanks 
yes i'm thinking less candidates take billionaire donors focus legislative executive prosecutorial flubs 
agree completely would want seem rehearsed try set go one offensive presented media friendly manner stuff democrats the cannot resist drama going offense get tons play and right side issue least point view positive coverage some potential topics see bloomberg honestly think eviscerate hold back redlining stop frisk buying elections differentiate evolvement democrat years ago strategic party switch year biden probably quite things could personally bankruptcy bill also feel like takes african american vote granted love specific policies address issues faced poc compare buttigieg inexperience know went recent ad came attacking job mayor argument focused lack legislatures experience especially regarding ins outs us congress players also federal sanders hard directly needs draw distinction explain better she show bernie lite alternative they progressive big dreams questionable paths accomplish socialism warren pragmatic progressivism capitalism regulated work middle lower classes klobucher specifically female solidarity plays well sure enough momentum actual threat risk message need stop klobucher's pr praise anymore take narrative away feisty witty woman stage steyer bother really nice guy people personally may actually come meaner last least trump throw punches trigger rage tweets dems left burns minions this personal wishlist understand much control discussion debate formats but say master debater phrase times fast keep rating full confidence brings game 
oh i'll vote trump would encourage well bloomberg decent certainly better climate guns he'll far immigration select issues assured nominate judges he's close ideal democratic candidate turns gets nomination volunteering get elected warren even enjoy 
mean margaret thatcher worry people calling fucking steamroll she advised soften image come across caring people attracted leaders lead that lot different things point time think right soft mute you might need fight fire show spark 
seen cross tabs published assume assumptions correct think bernie supporters chose candidates including pete biden much negative towards the answer simply misogyny 
want preface i'm say speculation based scarce info likely explanation bill gates came warren hard couple interviews fox business also attacks constantly owning woman gets eye balls men regardless ideology see blair white tomi lauren ect reply guys conservative media clinton least since occupy but know every source within campaign cnn reported now lot hillary dead enders team who's motivations might align warren's time story dropped late turn followers without looking like mess at point attrition polls way build back support fight sanders progressive lane attacked nh primary fans yesterday criticizing culinary union expect stop either idk bad blood two movements mended order get nod convention need rebuild kind truce bernie bros bern it down if there's moral candidates surrogates escalate rivalry beyond ability control supporters started beef end no one going bend knee something must done 
removed spreading misinformation this final warning 
he ally us though see absolutely reason record brought light debate stage it like dropping attack ads 
didnt mean ascribe something say maybe misinterpreted the headline mentioned race specifically mention factors assumed that's referring 
while agree deserve that's stopping barreling forward polls just ads country giving way legitimacy one debate would 
msnbc's youtube videos bloomberg sandwiched inbetween one video warren talking sanders he's i'm going physically i'll it improve outlets coverage outweighs every candidate combined that's trump got elected media actively trying make oligarch nominee know works stupid they traitors democracy sorry say single dem unite kick race officially dead 
just look klobuchar well debate surges and then start vetting it completely backwards well still really started bernie there's 
not voting dem helps gop the problem party system really change unless electoral college gone and given currently trump family royalists every single person dem primaries better even new guy literally nothing aggressive slide downwards 
that absolutely killing see people say going toward bloomberg think beat trump like poor condition us we're meet racist misogynist white billionaire man another we can't better why even bother elections just sell presidency highest bidder 
let compare trump bloomberg one two highly articulate mind blowingly successful intelligent supporting democratic causes years the trust fund baby terrible everything apart marketing verbal skills preschooler authoritarian anti democracy hell generally shitty racist person wanted kill innocent people implemented disgusting steal babies asylum seekers policy etc 
it would extremely hard vote even trump point definitive message could literally buy presidency as evil took time hoodwink people old fashion way the only reason dnc allowing terrified maybe threatened run rd party 
it's scuffed suprised bloomberg running favor trump point found thing earth could get vote 
this probably correct answer our billionaire gets defenses lowered everything nodded long their least democrats look like they're jobs drone strikes repealing glass steagall etc fraction left turns fight watch 
oh man he turn party far right would throw crumbs guns climate make feel better continues systematic targeting brown people via ice 
she actually gryffindor hat deliberated minutes ravenclaw also could worked but definitely run hufflepuff campaign since last winter got crucified every time much breathed tried playing non confrontational 
because competition bernie liberal vote 
of course misogyny agree woman speaking things fighting inherently going seen worse untrustworthy my point bombarding warren sexist slurs tropes liar snake etc believe half bernies votes new hampshire demo crosstabs correct make absolutely people go online see vicious attack trains delegate anger 
because overwhelming second choice netting almost plus berners hurt pete focus warren need unity turning progressives 
if start obviously false assumptions probably draw conclusion want that's dangerous make almost viewed warren negative came bernie camp it's almost statistically impossible given vote share held view unless assume sander's voters least supported second choice absurd the data actually directly contradicts prevailing subreddit said sanders campaign this strong evidence hyper toxic bros mainly localized reddit twitter highly online places particularly reflective support base edit intended respond comment one chain 
bill gates came warren hard couple interviews you sure he got pretty horribly misquoted little bit response wealth tax actually said interview contradictory context quote made front page but know every source within campaign cnn reported it also known year ago first broke time media interested sanders brawl story boring decided night debate would great break ask extremely biased way then say warren's leaked everyone instantly believe fits narrative want nh primary attacked fans yesterday criticizing culinary union having receiving end tell unacceptable behavior nobody treat people like 
when cnn say campaign think happened an opinion anchor speculated irresponsibly recall journalists saying definitively case 
maybe sake progressive unity warren brings opinion we're facing possibility democracy falling oligarchy plutocracy can't divide left bernie stood whole script scandal thing even apologized came come campaign official believe no need feed bros want i'm saying 
no one vets bernie it's frustrating 
as long nominates democratic judges appellate level scotus care 
voting bloomberg helps gop so write confidence and vote blue congress 
see people say going toward bloomberg think beat trump what's wild effectively evidence back as weeks ago highest unfavorability rating https fivethirtyeight com features ups downs candidate popularity charts amongst candidates behind tulsi stop frisk stuff came mainstream conversation despite fewer opinion biden sanders warren he particularly well among independents compared twitter ppollingnumbers status unlike two gotten little vetting appearances debates opening criticism responses just empty ads thing every time hold top spot head national polling trump razor thin margin makes sense knowing face backlash whatsoever point it's almost becoming self fulfilling prophecy gravitating towards existing base begin do honestly win republicans overwhelmingly support making gun control central issue campaign disagree sure hell and likely drowned younger minority voters would sit nomination bring new vote klobuchar buttigieg probably anyone cause stay home turn non negligible percentage away really hoping next debate particular ready eviscerate 
supporting democratic and republican causes years recently donating millions susan collins example 
let compare trump bloomberg starts next sentence comparing the thing hard tell give stitch together coherent distinction stops and frankly person trumps values common sense decency say quiet part loud even dangerous cheeto 
imagine smart trump let's pretend they're much different one intelligent stable dont fooled articulate someone 
it's hard yell money politics decade basically vote wad office 
agree regardless happens election see major changes two party system least democratic there's distinct centrist ideology lot moneyed interests currently flock trump progressive wins could consider building nothing substantiate current seems completely unsustainable 
idk everyone goes along we'd still bernie aoc ew like congress they're well aware bloomberg trust go agenda 
my state's primary end april plan voting warren long race feel like always see bernie supporters touting idealism pragmatism yet they're quick want liz throw bus stops polling well event he's progressive candidate left i'm going deny think he'll less effective president the idea giving throwing coronation presumptive nominee exact attitude fans fought hard he'll get vote best represents that's primaries work 
she got vote state washington dropped ballot friday it til 
would rest america well friend 
and ranked choice voting people would thing 
it categorical imperative also lfg 
hmm seems pretty complicated though 
which part problem bernie ideology gets far eventually get things done pragmatic progressive like warren choice 
she got washington vote and convinced conservative parents they usually republican hate trump blue matter year 
on hand voting think would win terrible irrational belief fortune telling mind reading self fulfilling prophecy makes feel like shit 
but make terrible choice there another candidate who's leading super tuesday polls that is makes feel like shit continue glad early voted warren tx give one good goddamn many states and come elizabethwarren hear negativity 
trumpian tactics around camp bucko 
i'm jumping ship going warren 
additionally come hard ukraine scandal first candidate impeachment immediately mueller report released https www vox com platform amp policy politics elizabeth warren mueller trump 
biden sounds like swell person grab lunch sometime want president though 
welcome tell family tell friends

they do exist this first pro biden person i've encountered wild 
well said glad aboard never felt confident strongly towards candidate warren

it hopeful see warren unite factions party strongly pro bernie disappointed running trust world compassionate persistent hands 
yeah totally i've warren fan couple months early thought maybe pete guy might moment need someone willing go full frontal attack corruption wealth inequality this means sanders think sharper ie bernie starting slow bit longevity fierce years welcome club 
yay welcome think overall arc true lot voters coming months she could really run away 
welcome actually lot affection uncle joe it feel like moment national polling notwithstanding if recent history taught us anything establishment candidate always loses 
glad warren genuinely never met biden supporter can explain drew bc think reason 
bidens dropping polls ever since ukraine thing came 
it certainly looks like steadily building broad coalition i'm liberal person also somewhat pragmatic comes politics get turned candidates promising moon warren lot ideas many major reforms feel practical time 
this meant criticism warren anyone else substantively think important interesting came impeachment first senators say proceedings knowledge gone far would vote convict house occurred though undoubtedly every democratic senator to signaling politics fire base fine give attention deserves 
not one read mueller report day came told naacp delegates unanimously voted tuesday recommend house launch impeachment proceedings trump when got end stick finger air ask politics hesitate this man broken law impeached bernie sanders said he exonerated called racist trying divide american people based color skin begin inquiry matter fact president everything could obstruct investigation https www theguardian com us news jul democratic candidates mueller testimony 
he effective compromised democrat two generations deserves happy retirement 
discuss wife she thinking going biden warren seems like strong nominee switched i'm trying convince father he right better polls trump that slowly changing well obama vs mccain point election he's love would much rather president awhile least looked sure thing if numbers hold steady think whole family primaries come around 
live illinois primary pretty late round i'm sure largely decided time things get 
try really hard hold candidate responsible actions supporters gets harder becomes pattern definitely know sanders reflect positively they're intelligent grounded reasonable they typically warren unfortunately less chill counterparts disproportionately vocal 
yes supporters tones definitely turned candidates so far mine pete warren different reasons generally they're nicer bunch people used donate 
same loonball clown fiesta sometimes yikes and anyone says outliers trolls seize means production help god 
which candidate agree policy wise 
really connecting illegal immigrants maybe open borders free healthcare she zero chance 
he's so cuteeeee hope gets little green tie 
buttigieg virtually chance i'm glad he's staying raise profile future elections 
buttigieg favorite think he's going gain reasonable chance really like warren 
think would excellent advisor even vice pres 
warren way better buttigieg trying lie would cost taxes even though pay insurance company basically private tax 
get notification anything i'm mod must setting somewhere is part save functionality 
month new tax vat everyone healthcare wealthy yang gonna get done next years choose one plus warren experience standing financial industry participating not saying vote find many people sub support the reason know lol 
this comment removed breaking rule dividing democrats 
really know there's correlation think biden would've dropped regardless 
he's dropping liz climbing hope candidate primary gives oxygen garbage story ukraine 
you think candidate can't poll party best chance winning general 
every time someone asks warren middle class taxes going go avoids question it smart avoid misleading meant get soundbytes her point overall cost healthcare includes many things including costs plan 
trump election three states vote margin think can't emphasize enough narrow victory it's second closest modern history trumps's absolute lightning bottle neither top candidates right bernie biden liz going approaching general issues clinton for starters none invested fbi there comey letter released two weeks even first major scandal biden's wrapped resonating since clearly manufactured since trump's approval rating completely stagnant he climbed taking office that's unprecedented this means public sentiment baked there's ground swell support he's underwater independents democrats base extremely loyal that's old white guys evangelical protestants entire we also model path traditionally moderate republican leaning suburbs flipped republicans congressional seats decades time overwhelmingly college educated voters just look pa big dems hard favor even play anymore his wi mi well still defense like az nc fl seriously certain healthcare healthcare consistently highest polling issue petrified talking much brought earlier year lambasted https thehill com policy mcconnell trump repealing replacing obamacare that say win absolutely could but extraordinary circumstances got elected require get the probably qualified unseat would argue rest field save maybe booker actually trouble tulsi particular lot generating enthusiasm 
understand primaries every time someone asks warren middle class taxes going go avoids question she refusing give sound bite want there's actual nuances issue what tends say costs wealthiest americans big corporations hard working families see which true 
gabbard no fuck like she's way cozy fox news breitbart evidence pro putin leave alone shit 
you believe tulsi gabbard best chance even polling mostly occasionally who would vote democratic candidate support 
warren sanders going far left democratic moderates would surprised people saying obama 
of people moved would vote either party seriously think red scare factor overestimated tulsi strong candidate she one good issue anti interventionism lacks deep understanding implement urgent priorities like medicare combating climate change maybe meanwhile warren sanders seem capable things biden 
honestly get tulsi offers dovish standpoint progressive dems warren straightforward last debate would pull afghanistan matter first year she mince words guess hitch wagon low polling candidate who's happy divide spot fox news panel much capable promotes party unity clearer path nomination presidency 
tulsi would've great could've put together literally coalition imaginable idea makes think gotten people vote trump her largest problem anti war stance dangerously progressive candidates described how saying things like several days you impeachment going change election shapes 
this true most recent quinnipiac polling shows roughly even support across age groups right her among black voters nearly doubled since july in general message winning one ask anyone problematic government matter ideology agree corruption problem and also direct opposition trump embodies plans sort realist take bernie supports the way presents ideas makes seem ideal possible speaks abstract sense hard people buy already quite left simply put moved side overton window think warren realistic chance moving entire 
to warren fan rather bernie think either given carte blanche like happy world would look similar but reality politics always get want seems make better judgments compromise laid fought believes like single payer medicare all wrangling congress public option best freaking take make progress care suggesting now figure believe put table fight something accomplished know time if start compromised position less percent gets not sure anyone else understanding though 
steadily building broad coalition think point i'd surprised nominee reason anecdotal course mother middle class suburban moderate democrat i'm working urban progressive she get see bernie sees biden like warren 
warren lot ideas many major reforms feel practical time one things initially drew well 
you also get sense doable going country worse position make happen things need 
agree think feel pragmatic part elizabeth warren excellent teacher she makes clear many policy items would come fruition heavy lift denial realistic 
op talking warren's leadership impeachment changed mind so i'm pointing leading issue long time the point simply impeaching trump right thing wrongdoing wrongdoing whether politically expedient warren took risk calling arguments totally sound everyone else making political saying it hurt democrats it's distraction etc big deal one paid much attention ahead polls furthermore comes many realized democrat thinking https www vanityfair com news inside nancy pelosi cave elizabeth warren 
would curious see article time announcement got one 
from article this moment history every single member congress called vote live rest lives said warren first presidential candidate push impeachment point distinction emphasized furthermore published months one linked 
if numbers hold steady think whole family going warren primaries come around her rcp average https www realclearpolitics com epolls president us democratic presidential nomination html steadily increased whereas bernie biden stagnant she's actually cracking joe choice large percentage sanders voters anything's gonna stop got momentum excitement that's carry way especially win early states already look great iowa projects fivethirtyeight iowa new hampshire new hampshire the recent selzer co poll monmouth university leading these rating pollsters according 
think biden's strength polls house cards he strong seen it means lose lot support another candidate prove also electability 
i've concerned ge polling well look numbers trump basically number matter faces it's people outright supporting dem and sanders biden much higher recognition warren think top candidates would solid leads knew nominee 
tell historically polls today general election actually meaningless https fivethirtyeight com features take early seriously amp twitter impression true not like treat caution basically unrelated results next november use ones last june points avg hillary everyone instance that's warren well generals tuned middle knows would candidates outside top low ge meaningless 
oh put money https en wikipedia org wiki illinois democratic primary march th time last that's super late two weeks super tuesday plus right next iowa no rest persistent 
the unreasonable ones remind trump supporters ways say bernie's hope 
in experience people claim wrong saying toxic supporters reason support candidate want held accountable people interact they fellow campaigns full happen accident 
feel like welcoming time around start then sudden started movement every candidate bernie corporate shill scene 
anecdotally know bernie supporters jumped trump clinton nominated there lot personality overlap fandoms 
completely understand makes people mad their policies radically different obviously but they're core populists history shows populism across board politics secondary they way saying benefiting group functionally similar populists also tend promote person the bird landed podium example immediately became icon that's populist thing trump hats wall how sanders defends bills wrote damn bill rather substance he's defending populism scares hell making icons rarely gone well 
they say those real bernie supporters yeah the final straw efforts turn elizabeth hillary want redo 
she posted video influence zoomies last night laughing like every dog owner seeing crazy excited 
would like remind everyone point time carter clinton kerry obama polls iowa eventually lost candidate but pete howard dean dick gephardt exactly warren biden also mean raise profile 
the primaries betting best chance winning fear based support win voting get biden supporting deep believe candidate if that's mayor pete vote even loses primary high turnout yang booker kamala whomever send strong message nominee influence policies going forward knowing large group democrats they'll still need general election 
urgh come warren pete's subs attempt keep separate but i've defended last week gotten downvoted pete sub seems reverse okay he's pragmatist honestly think realizes path forward progressive future democratic reform warren similar policies made day priority pete first hr abolishing electoral college state hood pr dc scotus getting rid citizens united even make super pac donations transparent reforms wealth tax etc everything liz wants never happen and happens repealed next time gop win house senate presidency even makeup court surely end ruling laws illegal only way prevent backwards movement progress done these pragmatic choices sure legislative successes taken away as facts history tell us presidents limited window enact change liz's policy enacted fact map listed the issue package get free tuition anyway i'm pretty label misses point 
even that's true bad thing white house if anything i'd say they're quite boring 
mean it would cost taxes though total costs pay fund let's beat around bush it's worth and cheaper premiums 
he also charges selfie https www avpress com opinion get elizabeth warren eight article af ac html 
what's wrong statement he wants warren plainly state fact taxes will go plan counter mentioning private insurance premiums also away he's telling truth dances around questioned https abcnews com politics warren shed raise middle class pay health story id www washingtonpost politics question elizabeth wont answer cnbc least warrens medicare problems html it's well documented straightly her response time lie answering specifically asked legitimate criticism isn't frustrating see someone ask politician give address actual usually good giving straight answers i'm sure issue it change they're top two picks 
know weird thing following sub doubt things trending 
could see like tulsi hitting maybe castro it's unlikely frontrunners would imagine going near 
if seriously think party performance national know tell 
costs healthcare total yes going go but cost coming paycheck that's lot americans care not everyone uses system check census statistics there literal quote brett o'hara chief census bureau's health disability branch the decline use medical services widespread taking place regardless health status fact matter people i'm debate whether good bad used that means even using still charged big issue many if solution get overburden currently burnout profession rampant recent study thomas reith shows physicians nurses experience due exhaustion cynicism long term job stress throwing help of course biased work trauma one hospital literally live every single day you cannot expect professionals take 
this comment removed breaking rule dividing democrats

cross post politics feel like needed 
this i'm concentrating going throwing little money getting rid mitch susan collins trying keep doug jones 
gotta say chances taking back senate slowly increasing bullock's announcement moved needle bit want get hopes high god take would greatest birthday present ever nullify everything shitty primary 
yep donating crooked media get mitch die trying fund going find one two specific races get involved currently thinking az since geographically closest maybe also me fuck susan collins 
will supporting barbara bollier kansas real shot kobach nominee also donating joni ernst's opponent whoever 
colorado's cory gardner pretty weak likely get replaced dem candidate right we're trying choose billionaire backed frak water drinking oil gas candidate hickenlooper progressive supporting green andrew romanoff the senate races matter you can't wait vote cause knows slot get involved 
focusing unseating susan collins mitch mcconnell think shot would love see senate races republican incumbents hire warren staff she built strong coalition 
forget local races perhaps even run office our state legislature joke i'm looking forward campaigning fresh faces 
introducing get mitch die trying fund started pod save america https secure actblue com donate getmitch i'll leave 
like idea focusing ticket races after seeing many people involved election acting decided want anger key driving force life it you know saying angry paying attention buy 
yup that's exactly i'm doin 
if wanted volunteer flip senate seat state chance help presidential general election pick think efficient use time get people polls states whichever cis straight white old man helping always ideas 
really like pivot while energy course going blue matter general vitally important get mcconnell power flipping senate get mitch die trying 
yes sorry of course right mean noticeably changed as podcast linked goes seems definite graham republicans like new version 
not angry sad at least still bernie 
still want see warren senate majority leader she's damn sight better schumer 
list progressives running congress also check brand new rose caucus justice dems slates wayofthebern comments wkl 
don't forget cal cunningham north carolina fact much winnable southern counterpart thom tillis insidious weaker incumbent lindsey graham gave great interview pod save america today definitely send money 
we trade bad graham good there's woman named kimberly running senate iowa trip dc took picture front lindsey graham's office covered first name looked like future she's lovely please check website https kimberlyforiowa com 
that would probably make graham hot bothered got spanked black man 
love have contributing campaign what win would 
remember years back interviewed rachel maddow like it would fabulous 
cross post voteblue democrats instead 
you allowed say mad warren left 
god amazing democratic president could actually get something congress 
bullock's announcement literally got good mood today despite sleeping six hours 
my plans donation respective primaries amy mcgrath vs mcconnell ky sara gideon collins me teresa tomlinson loeffler ga barbara bollier open race ks mark kelly mcsally az john hickenlooper gardner co cal cunningham tillis nc steve bullock daines mt maybe though long shot doug jones al incumbent nearly centrist that's nature biggest tent 
question get mitch die trying fund so split funds including georgia does ga share two senate races normal one special election 
grew ks although red state way politically complicated people give credit blew away elected laura kelly sharice davids think bollier shot 
same governor kelly good balancing force colossally moronic legislature partially kobach thank helping hand us its gonna tougher get bollier senate especially orman splitting gop vote but moderate history working across aisle kansas hates trump way partisan lean would suggest got chance 
so focus ticket races rosie outlook 
arizona maine colorado probably likely pickups alabama want help defend vulnerable democrat 
arizona imo it swing state presidential race solid shot flipping senate big turnout dems could 
hope cal cunningham wins my mother father law vote republican know tillis hopefully get enough people 
or send phonebanking hours north carolina get friends go canvassing 
pod save america listen episode wait road trip binge thanks suggestion 
the politics mods even pretend moderate impartially it space russian disinformation propaganda point 
same daylight savings always messes 
there important primaries like ed markey marie newman 
don't forget jaime harrison he fighting lindsey graham's seat amy mcgrath main focus if elected would literally only time two black men served simultaneously senate southern states 
i'd add al gross liberal independent alaska endorsed ak dems running dan sullivan particularly popular he's fundraised well far solid chance 
honestly might one benefit biden nominee think longer coat tails candidacies what game changer would 
three cheers mark kelly so excited campaign my favorite senate candidate think i'm space nut amazing wife love he's really leaning electing senator actually believes science that's great you know he'll push hard gun control really one 
nearly centrist that's nature biggest tent that's running electable candidates 'right' party conservative moderate purple states an example gop superpacs spending millions primary cal cunningham progressive dem candidate would never win ge nc year thank support 
mcgrath need money likely lose kentucky deep red really hard make inroads unless incumbent moron like matt bevin even loss insanely narrow send gary peters michigan he's facing strong opponent john james also tomlinson running david perdue candidate support open race rev raphael warnock 
hickenlooper colorado pro oil gas billionaire donors andrew romanov contesting dem nomination senate seat pretty well much progressive if gets i'll support but still air i'm pushing 
i'm sure think way fund splits subject change race develops if polling shows seats chance flip they'll maybe showing one seat potential might put funding 
especially lifelong liberal republican switched parties along handful others if get endorsements retired well liked moderate former senators reps good chance 
same knew rd district could flip though even pleasantly surprised went sharice kelly seems like better sebelius knock wood i'm really rooting bollier even making competitive force gop divert resources normally 
yup never thought dem would chance senate seat growing i'm cautiously optimistic certainly seeing rd go blue dog dennis moore yoder sharice davids huge and maybe base seems like kelly progressive sebelius so quite hopeful 
isn important commit ethical behavior things rosy feel like bad excuse people using resorting low blows assuming worst supporters candidate 
it's gonna come suburbs rural african americans north carolina votes make happen 
do best change mind look policies find specific things matter then look tillis done know like every vote counts 
no one likes tillis he's douchebag boggles mind saw pat mccrory years ago opening local eco industrial park the two nothing self congratulation ego political doublespeak say i'll surprised wins another term cal cunningham excellent candidate take that said still use help support get already gop superpacs tried primary radical democratic would never win general election nc year lots money throw race another thing turn tillis's seat may good chance getting moderate democrat richard burr's retires 
oh yeah got banned making joke 
oh arizona dst lol trouble sleeping my stupid cat insists fed fucking 
as long martha coakley allowed near another ballot how many races lose i've lost count 
everyone still rating graham's seat solid republican if changed would certainly get involved many races could benefit time i'd love cook political proven wrong though phonebank enough maybe move lean 
mcgrath need money likely lose we're still months election moscow mitch already incredibly unpopular kentucky us whole kicked republican governor last year could itching think soon discount amy mcgrath's chances especially since polling neck https www dailykos com story ky sen two polls confirm toss up race between she's long shot candidate supported congressional run two years ago honor elizabeth warren i'm supporting along sara gideon maine mark kelly arizona

the very real possibility president elizabeth warren 
yeah think underestimated people probably benefit but clinch nomination surprise everyone 
electability fiction anyway kerry thought electable still lost obama way time campaign trump unelectable hunk matter planet if concentrate worry electability already we need get behind someone inspires us great job everything elect after our decision power that said warren total package met minneapolis week fire excitement inside since she spoke amazing her energy electric and stinkin smart seconds warm really made feel like cared individual part voting mass people it think one reason president 
but even warren benefit making argument electability rather contending said already settled that appears position biden camp including spouse https www cnn com politics jill biden joe beat donald trump dr jill recently urged voters ignore qualifications candidates favor husband alleged ethereal proven course times president this made laugh might stealing stinger end next time someone tells electable 
honestly look polls biden stayed pretty consistent bernie trending downward warren candidate consistently upward long term if continue trend matter time 
can't put finger personal beliefs line harris anyone else but really like warren somehow much excited nb i'm posting debate policies support idea excite people even perfectly 
the real possibility america might actually choose best option dem candidates reelect corrupt incompetent racist rapist carnival barker 
as long bernie would happy both make great president 
we already proof trump ballot enough prevent americans showing vote also get show this honestly can't make mistake like last time running joe biden safe electable candidate think nearly beat i'm voting warren supportive bernie well inspire people 
since started volunteering campaign truly honest god think gonna 
just subbed like dem candidates really warren brings table think dream ticket buttigieg imagine intelectual devastation two would bring stage 
agreed underestimated good people give serious contention unless reporting brand release plans every weeks time keep pace steady rise seems show approach paying 
hell trump good example happens underestimate people so think right 
umm favorite according betting markets not sure underrated 
mean he's attempts become president doesn't shout electable 
agree actually tend reform rather restructure policy preferences less radical find cohesiveness vision thoughtfulness confidence policies combative respectful tone exceptional communication skills general optimism really appealing inspiring all things emblematic qualities make good leader right winning vote want hear speak foreign democratic though looking 
interesting trying start anything please take genuinely curious harris believes lines beliefs exclusion candidates personally found statements kind compromise state biden bennet wing party sanders warren also supporter totally agree exciting candidate 
think problem polls right for many people bernie if one dropped split warren would come together ahead biden 
sounds good but bernie stood thing years never republican takes zero corporate money campaign say primaries like sanders next president 
yeah think trump going underestimate she make look like kindergartner tantrum 
think he's result people overestimating american public 
so hillary get complacent it's better lays low otherwise frontrunner she'd attacked 
betting markets mainstream source wisdom sometimes get wrong mean handful economists predicted housing bubble bust great recession far back mid accolades deserve 
likeability piece running bush war veteran countered dumb idea republicans love country enough fight he bland honestly inoffensive mean electable inspiring even conservative dems go it bull say 
well maybe good say health care might hold nose are trying inspiring because jill biden thinks 
obama started reform replace got modest important many people still maybe going better starting position 
pm'd fair question care get publicly 
time place bro op said interested starting discussion kamalas policies respect 
agree point commonly made bernie subreddit when look aggregated polls realclear correlation warren either goes drop used left liberals now many positions shared multiple candidates they become mainstream we great can wait later debates get much time respond 
my dream would bernie win nomination pick warren vp one term fix country retire letting run goes keep things going two terms 
i'm pretty hardcore bernie supporter plan volunteering canvassing next year get pundits say bad idea political science classes tell potential recipe diaster care warren ticket stuff dreams it'd unstoppable 
what he zero shot the could hope spot someone's cabinet 
listening warren since professor pretty safe say stood things years hope bernie next president happy 
they're all taking big money general least ruling you're naive think otherwise viable election presidential campaign completely different ballpark primaries 
that ridiculous one needs make look like child throwing tantrum 
agreed get give attention front runner she yet polls want getting saddled extra baggage stage 
if wins nomination find curious every discussion biden ends somebody saying hold nose vote it weird assumption automatically supposed aside trump though little appeal at least compared many options 
think time different goals reform pit stop way replace reform destination obama reformer never wanted radical change candidate would backed something like medicare all mean healthcare principled policy position compromise unwilling go bolder just thought worth clarifying sometimes moderate candidates incorrectly viewed brave bold enough take positions really want what often case truly believe actually best one 
don need cheap shots comment called substantively already 
polls regularly show https projects fivethirtyeight com primaries democratic national bernie warren second third place respectively behind biden but add two together combined polling sanders match exceed the problem requires supporters favorites actually shown false features lanes starting emerge primary what really needs happen wonder strategy convention brokered whomever rd would give votes nd thus beating assuming trends remain either giving delegate handing nomination 
think back presidents office they're good idea just put warren two terms use years prepare next generation progressive leaders 
also hesitant see internet turn like pick iowa nh former bernie supporting astroturfers attention toward attacking instead biden 
absolutely agreed think especially insane point wife said practically word hold nose speech 
not every comment needs replied harris is bad candidate count agree btw 
important add data second choices comes morning consult pollsters like pew show different results https twitter com ppollingnumbers status 
worry perception happening will biden supporters okay even within rules strategizing convention seems pretty shady 
age really matter comes presidents having quality people important both bernie warren would make great 
think telling response close associates obama run coming practically screaming dude america need 
think quite nerve complain could accuse divisive gonna elect trump vote nominee in words response tell stuff blame refuse 
here issue maybe wrong incumbents advantage having sanders president one term puts party disadvantage republicans if happens die office leaves us lame duck presidency first real modern progressive administration doubts would healthy fit but second and could hobble agenda decades capture get stuck neutered sure anything happen anyone anytime age important factor thinking eight years four

guess know surge real enough trump starts calling pocahontas right he's still focused joe biden 
don't forget would elect we need hold politicians promises they work people 
what psephologists say want believe 
liz kickin ass doubt mind campaign began would storming victory she far compelling message statesmanship balance liberal progressive wings party should placed bet earlier odds probably poor 
fivethirtyeight rated uc berkeley institute governmental studies started polls fully independently yet incorporated recent midterm cycle ratings prior instead relied joint collaboration field poll fivethirtyeight data closed operations following fwiw the igs poll seems inherited polling director mark dicamillo 
good question sure can't find rating https www latimes com politics la na pol poll done story html berkeley conducted apparently email based 
way early she front runner expect next debate chock block full but how gonna pay for it attacks along you republican bernie stans 
think pocahontas means much anyone except going vote anyway 
right he's focused impeachment let's hope stays way 
honestly think he's going focused biden mostly got lying perhaps ridiculous way possible 
hope comes better answer how going pay originally liked attempts reframe question feel like lost lot voters came across dodgy if try go past record think slam dunk people grow change its silly thing hold shows willing mind facts tell wrong 
literally moment pulled ahead got literally donald trump hate stuff the new story mastermind successfully lying years anti corruption progressive truly chaotic evil trojan horse fascist regime six months ago everyone liked bernie's ideas similar now devil incarnate nobody tell pulling saw behavior others 
you think he's going break non aggression pact first might right eating base younger white voters 
she front runner do mean behind biden want win either think he's weak still leading https www realclearpolitics com epolls president us democratic presidential nomination html polls projects fivethirtyeight primaries national it's hard believe lots supporters boomers quiet familiar comfortable voting vote these types bernie liz radical underestimate 
the good answer dodgy raise taxes healthcare one stopped bearing wife question it comes leading premise reject makes look bad myriad attacks wealth tax insufficient pointless red herrings nobody asks gonna pay another battleship let government figure deficits concern need manage budgets holistically program basis people ever disingenuously think electorate gets republicans certainly get way cut agenda 
people grow change certainly but choice someone usually wrong else always right 
he need anything his surrogates supporters online heavy lifting noxious already sanders comes across fine zero capacity enforcing message discipline within campaign 
clinton scandal involved fbi investigation warren table already small amount native american ancestry occasions several decades ago identified native that whole damn thing 
get but see lots well intentioned people wondering warren honest tax plan think something along lines yes pay taxes joe's still paying just instead they'd called things like premiums deductibles want overhaul healthcare country and focusing increases focus matters much american under costs go might help address question hitting root problem 
say warren always right time trump usually wrong almost so still brainier choice 
oh meant moderate dems say 
there sound byte anti warren ads next year though just saying overall cost goes dishonest 
yup specifically biden falls harris klobuchar they're still around 
bruce team warren sending best wishes speedy recovery berniesanders hope see friend back campaign trail soon

agreed agree username cheesesteaks are better onions 
hey quick question originally bernie supporter absolutely love warren well is particular reason support warren thank 
it weirdly heartwarming coming conspiracy folks 
we must reading different comments all see calling manipulative negative 
went hospital chest pains had surgery get stents heart it's minor though 
https www washingtonpost com politics bf df story html in case also wanted read 
agree his copay probably minimal government insurance though should still billing breakdown 
know like talk much definitely 
exactly going say upvote comment instead 
know harris it makes wonder trump would done republican primary 
right i've heard ppl talk russian warren trolls think really or else they'd ghoulish 
good place work ol' mute button muscle 
saw implications like politics thread according recent morning consult poll bernie's supporters biden second choice warren think wise us act bernie voters come forced drop regardless though worse look give right excited taking it reason split continue hope gets better back campaign trail soon he adds much conversation let's win candidate best president time running 
would rather speculate things it's possible surge could happen last way want kind don't forget warren also septuagenarian immune health scares 
we cannot afford lose senate one mothballed office vp 
i'm hoping whichever two get nomination stays senate ally 
to crassly political highly unlikely either would want ticket two fairly old white lefties most likely sanders warren try diversify adding younger poc state region need boost vps usually selected create balance rather double qualities nominee vp picks also tend politicians okay playing second fiddle bigger personality top neither really fit bill 
this terrible idea practically your vp balancing weaknesses sanders one person running meet standard 
i'll say sanders warren course i'm happy either idk likely tho they're progressive senators new england honestly think matters would killer ticket true match made heaven for anyone wondering mainly bernie great job serving one term passing buck liz serve we could get three terms presidents 
read cheesecake first time go 
here ya go https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments cjcguc case warren left but keep mind they're awesome candidates make great presidents like asking whether prefer ice cream sprinkles whipped might preference delicious 
bernie warren supporter in addition amy wrote things like strong medicare all robust environmental plan important actually better senate fighting legislatively speaking president sign whatever passes congress law the also chooses cabinet members accounts made excellent hiring decisions cfpb https www vox com policy politics elizabeth warren cfpb founding plans obama president 
i'd avoid characterizing surgery minor major sanders campaign officially announces occurred when comes medical diagnosis difference filled brim anecdotal information understand specific patient's history current diagnostics able give real answer question 
really hope ok think recover minor surgery year olds 
we elect new wave aocs need duplicate squad en masse 
completely disagree ticket way valuable considering much significant demographic overlap two candidates core bases additionally sending unified progressive message incredibly important either one centrist vp anyone favors with could also work whiping votes senate 
my guess warren goes booker castro vp harris ag sanders probably picks 
booker vp he's younger poc executive experience warren lacks harris ag like since seem leader lack clear vision prosecutor first matter second great gabbard secretary state opposite neocon foreign policy objectives still ha balls buttigieg kind ambassador williamson lead prayer dinner 
it autocorrected cheesecake first actually i'd open trying savory one caramelized onions though 
from i've seen said surgery finished bernie high spirits 
pci coronary stenting one common procedures united states it involves feeding wire femoral artery groin heart inserting expanding metallic coils hold open arteries supply blood surgical procedure minor this fact also single vessel disease also meaninful agree come think basics 
i'm pretty concerned campaign downplaying the fact statements sound like he's definitively returning really worrying 
i'm sitting hoping good senators like markey get primaried my hope would happening left center 
it pretty rare vp comes primary competition this time might different since field particularly qualified diverse senatorial also somewhat unusual think expand idea would considered cabinet positions democrats built deep bench past years across federal state offices wealth people choose 
do even know clinton talking 
the procedure minor routine even going anticoagulants probably beta blockers months stent site fully healed those harsh draining really hope impact ability sustain demanding campaign schedule know tired much younger husband 
again statement health outside campaign going based anecdotal information best take stock political rumor mill especially rumors amplified exponentially 
yeah get like joe kennedy wants move ladder wait little longer see warren becomes president ends prominent position run special election 
afaik gonna primary democrat justice democrats mainly take dems tendency vote republicans places heavily left leaning demographics 
sorry bearer bad news https www wbur org joe kennedy iii campaign kickoff ed markey 
he dual antiplatelets different anticouaglants anticoagulants reserved patients coinciding atrial fibrilliation the medications play significant part dont know bernie usually takes may well already 
that referring he polling well nothing kennedy think would make good senator bit unfortunate 
you start going somewhere else thread health human place spout ridiculous uniformed ideas someone 
oh gotcha reading get primaried someone challenge seat necessarily win 
you win edit sorry hate happened haiti 
elizabeth warren lands new iowa endorsements debate giving largest number state legislator candidate 
this get done folks warren's racking delegates hope continues snowball support key primary states 
can someone explain endorsements matter get would change voting 
one question happens endorsements low polling candidates withdraw 
iowa election caucus voter registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
if fan supporter given politician trouble deciding candidates endorsement could enough swing candidate you remember vast majority voters political nerds like 
they either endorse someone else nothing 
super delegates really important anymore new rules endorsement local people may familiar saying like someone there pay lot attention nationally might look 
as far understand pledged delegates super exception mary wolfe member congress could wrong the main difference two laypersons local level like activists city council members stuff superdelegates senators former president regardless pocket likely superdelegates take seriously this definitely good sign warren edit correction i'm explains better https www usa gov election 
that candidate endorses drop endorsers often follow lead 
super delegates vote first convention result winner understanding 
say they're important decide close election there fewer part 
as far understand pledged delegates pledged awarded primary these local political figures saying publicly think elizabeth warren president some attend campaign events iowa ask votes behalf 
thanks explanation if warren becomes president hope removes concept pledged super delegates it un democratic aligned progressive values 
state local level representatives ones actually knock people's doors speak one issues they often maintain relationships course voter's lives politician's careers you need watch meet the press read new york times like friendly person knocked door but first name basis given politician certain weight endorses someone met yet aoc also powerful endorsement different way certainly people across nation heard within state iowa fewer conversation talked politicians 
it gives local cache national statewide candidates especially nationalistic place like iowa matters quite bit 
aoc also polarizing bring many new voters bernie she'll energize current ones press hardcore likely supporter already it's one reason warren's campaign brushed 
you correct and happened half century never since modern primaries started 
they actually used unless brokered convention 
under first amendment freedom association federal state governments authority tell parties select candidates see https en wikipedia org wiki california democratic party jones 
agree thanks bringing can't life understand way maybe someone chime specifically people vote nominee early primaries caucuses general election why give delegates much power 
disagree common misconception political parties democratic government organizations they private operate rules bylaws candidate could pledge federal interfere operations suspect want alienate party trying get elected 
aren superdelegates really killed bernie almost went clinton regardless state results 
and real answer these people community part they splashy names make build ground game know go power goes need generator call favors stump speeches emphasize favor something happens having county level political meetings involved local elections extremely important especially caucus states 
it seems laying groundwork though 
in old days democratic nominee chosen party elders smoke filled room convention reforms mid th century made process democratic then primary voters nominated george mcgovern basically bernie sanders time he anti war progressive beloved college kids left got ass kicked hard nixon like maybe let make decisions hence super delegate system 
well one devil's advocate argument gop superdelegates would stopped trump shrug 
the delegates given much power dnc essence choose nominee people 
generally speaking though laws customs based around idea two party system if parties behave democratically free fair elections democracy 
no this really unpopular sentiment reddit bernies loss much superdelegates the controversy came news stations including supers delegate totals race going some bernie supporters claim chilling effect support later personally seen anything an argument made either way historically believe never tried unseat candidate got popular primary 
yes all superdelegates said going vote warren hillary polls counted endorsements that major influence convince people electable however bernie losing ballot box biggest factor changed source https www vox com bernie sanders clinton while dnc make changes like bernie's campaign went they villafied party making extremely difficult unite behind and legit supporters villafying think majority back wins nomination focus uniting dividing his rebellion joining exactly helpful whole 
no pledged delegates regardless you could argue massive amount supers endorsed may killed enthusiasm otherwise would supporters think removing changed outcome 
just fyi said warren instead hilary first paragraph 
whoops thanks i've got warren brain 
awesome got meet also anyone ever told look like bret the hitman hart this compliment 
wow elizabeth really long hair 
username checks also super jealous got meet

i'm warren's camp i'd thrilled vote primary general gets nomination bernie though happy if biden i'll 
the username checks haha i'm definitely jelly i've donated campaign wish could this grassroots money corporate donors people mobilizing organizing create better country energizing honestly 
bernie fight harder issues everyone cares elizabeth warren that's fact 
president elizabeth warren trending twitter first time 
cool what mean did say thing miss 
mrs president real nice ring 
it's powerful catchy line sprung netroots nation progressive convention to anyone working border patrol system understand you abuse immigrants physically sexually abused fail get medical care need break law united states america and donald trump may willing look way president elizabeth warren lnk https twitter com ewarren status 
in netroot talk said if abuse immigrants physically sexually deny medical care break laws united states america president trump may willing look way elizabeth warren not https twitter com ewarren status 
hopefully clever social media manipulation tactic team's part 
you weird habit deleting post history this tactic often employed troll accounts scrounging deleted make mention family ever three years account also the donald conspiracy one great awakening really skeptical story there's consistency comports saying 
didnt use college applications sooo 
it's great acknowledging some people seem think disregard law someone coming somewhere else the land supposed mean something 
no manipulation tactic response netroot speech https twitter com ewarren status 
no gave awesome speech netroots nation let's spread memes like 
pelosi madam speaker say roll 
it's name show cbs madam secretary president basically alternative timeline hillary clinton becomes not good the west wing still enjoyable you start season problem catching preview https youtu gqoshkewoso 
think kind poster really interested warren's background being upset handled native american status one thing points trying paint false picture warren person much means wealth enhance already privileged life the privilege father work due heart attack family car repossessed able afford college must broad definitions terms never accepted harvard she attended hey that's similarity professor 
you acting like calling next president insidious mind control tactic something normal every candidate ever done 
never said donald trump supporter post the conspiracy great awakening those subs dubious amount troll accounts even deleted comment removed your posting history connotes suspicious comportment i'm really skeptical things people say online without verification it's pretty easy dig regardless think deleting comments makes unreadable you've mentioned elsewhere engaging conspiratorial beliefs in interest transparency putting believe accountability lead instead dancing shadows 
yuuuuup isn exactly wanted democrat to finally brave sophisticated enough outmatch trump strategy 
not like aggressive strategies jumps support public driven more sustainable 
year old sophisticated enough outmatch trump's strategy 
hear of course like would just i'd believe pop speed pills age help manage insane campaign schedule pardon provocative image but i'm naive we're trying win election st century begrudge employing underhand tactics get ahead long illegal malicious it's gamesmanship if play someone else benefit which unfortunate game want 
and defended obfuscating history actually care estimation warren's character i'm raising doubt it's you shady posting one worthy skepticism regardless warren would think happens bumped 
i'm liking much referring election politics game it's fucking this shit real 
those kinda games make lose instantly though get found unless party completely morally bankrupt assholes we see franken way equating warren 
it many things go trump's way win least hillary years propaganda baggage clinton discouraging lots people voting rd party 
i'm sure what's offending winning matters you can't help people politics real life unless win election first 
know need warren for someone claims concern justice equal rights there's little nothing post history actually demonstrates advocacy understanding racism native americans first nation people you get sidelines injustice claim shield suggest understandings tribal sovereignty unfulfilled treaties current abuses land once tried delete makes harder see posted when submit things site saved regardless deleting trying obfuscate deflect evidence lack good faith part i'd allow room growth seems like unwilling take 
sen elizabeth warren mass introduced legislation wednesday would rescind medals honor awarded soldiers slaughtered hundreds lakota indians mostly women children wounded knee massacre 
so proud fellow okie standing native americans 
fox friends talk tomorrow morning within minutes realdonaldtrump tweet effective immediately ordering generals recind medals fake hero john mccain and give eddie gallagher instead 
hope take booker dewitts away 
this seems like odd thing focus right what's strategy 
this fantastic japan take notes 
wait rescind if definitely get called heroes committed undue atrocities 
yeah unfortunately republican senate probably chance passing 
indians like india percent agree 
this also good way making whole native american thing very smart political move 
in news donald trump trying figure bring dead war criminal medal honor recipients campaign trail 
she keeps moving for instance wrote bill make people buy hearing aids counter got passed republican senate signed law trump even though nra reason opposed the price go thousands dollars hundreds next year 
she like attacking people directly feel things repudiation so response trump focus past 
yeah definitely comes across grandstanding see necessary probably lead pocahontas type attacks 
please need another trail tears 
nra reason for indeed like wat maybe figure people untreated hearing loss socially isolated thus likely drift paranoid gun purchases 
if pocahontas attacks they're showing vulnerability 
considering first introduced deb haaland house history native american community it's simple bill making official retraction honors awarded atrocity holding important senate business since matter let people get deserve 
fair enough feel like attack ammo give right outweigh good progressives mean ads practically write elizabeth pocahontas warren wants desecrate veterans stripping medals it'll turn erase history type that's used confederate statues 
it making progressives feel good correcting inexcusable error lending credence still existing plight native americans sorry statute limitations right thing 
if end result trump's racism democrats became scared support america's minority populations would truly worst possible it's long past time stop proactively accommodating desires racists sexists homophobes we're might think let get fired vote protect war criminals we're going anything worth without pissing people 
yes on hand people react stuff ones would never vote warren anyway 
feel like people know battle wounded knee another us that's remembered today yes shows ignorance think i'm specifically ignorant the reason looked already warren supporter i'd imagine bunch look odd bad way then character something believe right looks 
warren second place california according new los angeles times poll 
nice pretty sure climbing want early primary season 
important note second place combine voters candidates first choice slides past biden st 
third straight poll show second let's go 
think something important see also lot support second choice candidate wonder many people worried viability it's possible polls like come real shot winning move first idk time tell also kinda feel bad kamala rough time home state californian expected we sentimental town pride politicians general rule and norcal us socal even less likely basis 
the on issues polling pretty illustrating terms differences frontrunners warren supporters want tax wealthy anything bernie medicare biden really seem enthused good thing taxing seems much popular 
as people learn policies support warren people biden hey recognize name pretty soon going fade even 
those plans getting well deserved momentum she favorite along nervous idiot voters would feel compared trump obviously win debates clinton care anymore perfect pass solidly behind weeks made first donation year looks like one president need correct course country 
this amazing california pushed primary election year should liz take second place even win home ton delegates convince fence yes support 
i've never met anyone actually likes joe biden why top polls 
as californian part push first fantastic thing moved primary june march rd biggest bastion democratic electoral votes nation actually say determining nominee 
good i'm glad people besides finally starting take seriously honestly tired biden point he's old news keeps making really weird stuff like telling year olds brothers keep guys away gross 
european let al gore monkey happened you guys voted nd time couldnt believe then obama promised one nope red senate went mad branded literal devil wtf bernie sanders made sense hillary possible lose trump yeah guess guys reagan bush clinton jr really heart right side please dont fuck cant defend anymore friends coworkers colleagues hate us make jokes love represents last years man hard 
is possibility bernie might end running mates for pres vp 
on twitter bernie supporters attack candidates atm even warren this divide give trump win plus rig election anyways 
yeah i'm really hoping edges bernie come voting season that way feel comfortable putting full support behind 
like watch prediction markets warren's trajectory extremely encouraging https www predictit org detail who win us presidential election 
likely bernie supporters vote goes once one beat biden take nomination 
we one year biden already slipping polls if people seriously think debates going help lol 
pretty much everyone know smart likes warren best worries electability the thing trap nobody predict everyone vote like primary also whoever nominee general is really difficult 
tax wealthy broad bipartisan support trump actually ran increasing taxes rich remember course lie but point even many republicans like idea think dem run explicitly tax message get back obama voters pay progressive programs want much harder if we've learned anything obamacare gop attempts repeal people fear change healthcare provider especially someone else forcing that's i've come around best something passed generate massive blowback happened optional opt system there bunch plans medicare buy etc go direction could see passing seat senate another factor saw government screwed aca exchange websites imagine dems try similar issues it'd disaster need care politically going slower choices allows time build prepare gradually expand coverage giving ability join right away so totally understand supporting starting warren i'm expecting votes pass and drop public option order preexisting conditions expanded expect president settle congress specifically assumes kill filibuster 
if pass wealth tax anti corruption laws walk park like warren committed single payer bill yet understand strategy emphasizing priorities 
yes could really jeb bush primary season 
care anymore she perfect pass more please we need stop catering stupid people want organize vote smart good things people like warren can will win we'll always let dumbest among us set stage follow lead 
she decent name recognition concerned opened low polling first couple months her steady climb great sign shows cementing supporter base rather one latches initial likability 
double edged sword necessarily means less money general also needed primary hah maybe works 
feel bernie he's old busted time make room someone new 
your feelings dissimilar many people live 
running mates usually picked 'balance ticket' she'll run someone south western state maybe bit less progressive someone like inslee hickenlooper abrams castro 
on twitter promise life improve never look twitter 
the bot armies force already everyone who's surprised stand head recite alphabet backward 
and hopefully concedes early enough votes split really matters 
hope edges biden warren vs bernie two faves 
remind horse race trying pick winner 
back forth two sanders speech yesterday makes currently prefer warren curious 
that really depends left primary day next year we almost go lots things change time beating biden means certainty given renown general popularity by june poll numbers major candidates look extremely different 
i'm sure currently rcp biden's warren bernie collectively even add lesser supported progressives like gabbard yang castro rise it really depends supporters candidates harris buttigieg o'rourke klobuchar booker bennet land collectively account electorate 
pretty much everyone know smart likes warren best worries electability just remind trump he supposed anti electable candidate the typical rules window 
just tell al gore john kerry electability whereas barack obama black guy terrorist's name donald trump 
think needed becomes politically viable pass congress we need fix campaign financing kochs can't run tens millions anonymous ads end political gerrymandering new voter rights laws increase registration rates lower barriers legal voting election results better reflection people actually want you mandate paper ballots excuse mail ranked choice federal elections add dc pr states correct injustice americans disenfranchised give dems fairer senate map stronger punish accept foreign interference secure systems hacking and maybe open medicare anyone wants join let public see provides great service kill republican fear mongering things accountable wealthy donors detailed plan like make case win get implement 
find inconceivable warren personal plan healthcare even largely cribbed sanders the idea radically progressive everything especially plug says market right silliest wedge attempt trolls like seriously think platform would i'm going tax wealthy give everyone free childcare college make minor tweaks 
love single payer magic wand it'd first choice several equally effective models universal coverage 
it's throwback patriarchal sexist mores women property responsibility men lives if wants talk boys let someone keep away she'll ask 
that racist joke maybe i'm dumb get context how 
he conceded hillary feel like he'd thing 
or concedes it goes ways i'm sure helps stay far race ends clearly behind 
now we're talking dream scenario my true see sanders warren general election ticket together whatever order 
it's horse race first past post election quite easy choosing favorite unfortunately 
it's pretty close mostly campaign seems focused getting money politics think biggest issue right she also little less angry i'm sick last years 
warren better coalition builder two think likely sanders beat biden whoever needs rally voters kinds stripes cause far left moderates people non ideological committed bernie stans hillary support fringe candidates want electability factional worked anti candidate options lot second understands policy deeper level hear talk clear trust solve unforeseen problems third led key issues namely impeachment she way ahead one 
bernie stump speech again no one disagreees but need specifics i'm good sold dreams calling guns pitchforks really advocating reformed capitalism if thats case smarten sell smarter like warren 
his speech kinda showed imo ideas guy anything really social democrat 
believe warren work others run country much better bernie that lean great ideas anti establishment find ways get support policies similar slightly less radical knows behind 
biden could easily fall polls especially get debates 
important note biden poached bernie supporters entered race i'm sure lot support based fact he's frontrunner really solid 
in ca poll question biden super tuesday state really see staying strong though remainder race can't carry both bernie warren excellent candidates great news polling slip doubles i'm candidate rich dems non trump republicans debates going favor sanders strongly views aligned majority country across topics come 
rcp good aggregator slow change they're starting adjust biden's fade though 
they made argument bernie unelectable hillary electable when point say well win popular vote maybe smart second thought 
agree think hurt call systemic reforms and support i'm sure reluctance if anything makes goals rewriting laws across board even popular 
stv https youtube com watch xozjkozfi help greatly lessen gerrymandering eliminates throwing away vote we fighting city county state level 
what think ought framing stance like progressive commentator david pakman embrace single payer significantly better way cut costs expand health care provisions people profit system time acknowledge multiple ways achieve gold standard universal coverage lower it would definitely fit broader thesis needs stronger government involvement businesses avoid putting motives ahead unfortunately kind wavering much favors love warren political hero started supporting moment announced run currently i'm torn bernie trying objective possible assessing candidates' messages especially support 
wonder going advocate universal healthcare single payer thus sound cool talking 
she signed co sponsor bernie bill but suspect see healthcare coming week leading first debate anticipate release fleshed policy happens 
way shape form please explain 
they're trying reference lyrics colors wind pocahontas they've also got comment history nigs gonna nig racist 
not months here's ways bernie still win articles 
he conceded hillary basically last possible second done super tuesday mega new york extra california crispy dc decided concede chances went now people think right thing let's write history the dude stayed way would 
she would far enough ahead could see hold primary 
oh agree feeling like stock rising bernie plateaued even starting shift warren either way want one two biden but will vote general hate every moment 
the primary actually fptp you need true majority delegates win initial vote may include superdelegates candidates coalition building maintaining positive favorability among candidate's supporter important it's almost like single transferable situation 
personally see bernie angry more frustrated and warren necessarily trying get money politics understand every citizen getting unfair tax breaks worth million like would love team 
anyone angry past years treated suspect imo 
left wing politicians valid reasons angry anger worthwhile helps people instead hurting 
warren better coalition builder two this one complicated think within democratic party but sanders' brand left wing populism effective pulling non traditional voters independents even republicans know pro sanders disagree things admire consistency willingness call bad behavior party members stances policies like nafta definitely agree diplomatic led key issues bernie namely impeachment agreed bernie's responses got asked came first time ever felt dishonest absolutely presidential candidates it right thing 
see point well like warren lot can wait debates 
see point can wait hear debates 
if sexist remarks toward warren last debate nothing debates affect his support media helps national news framing warren's new plan basically paraphrased 'warren's cost take money defense budget biden says unrealistic stupid now cut commercial aetna insurance 
that makes think name recognition thing since bernie biden different also known others 
wish sanders warren ticket together would landslide defeat trump 
it easily happen right he's coming initial campaign entry bump trying ride way debates general media mentions he need spend abundant cash reserves others if looks like warren going overtake sanders fully go blitz push obama era credit break progressive voters biden knows got inherent advantage scare anti socialist votes old scraps clearly wounds knock the important thing pro folks fall rhetoric see green imperialism communism propaganda trolls throwing mix whittle away via incredible number gaffes time politics so long forced give press defending hyde amendment backlash well failures economic prescience shoring instead attacking most importantly must courteous open honest mindful reality numbers look good flailing reasons world us finding ways accelerate problems this race putting best candidate forward also making sure stay together progressives moderates rd etc make trump co can't pull second upset egos chaffed 
pointing things true makes people dumb 
i'm saying warren others support dems need keep talking win public overton window think going find votes senate house major systematic changes like green new deal without first fixing systems determines goes congress fix elections elect better better take bold action address issues 
dunno explicitly said think markets work healthcare really focusing transition happens exactly pay warren mostly education it say pieces could make health care something basic human right fight rights public public market driven markets well https www vox com policy politics elizabeth warren interview democratic primary policies 
maybe clear https slate com news politics joe biden iowa campaign teenage girl fence warning html the subtext jokes threefold first biden wants alert girls young women families fact finds attractive therefore danger second people protect implicit threat men might pose like certainly lives big presumably built man third say sexual begin designated guardians able use line part recognizes addressing largely powerless respond they already taught embarrassed bodies appearance forced listen laugh nervously powerful uses budding sexuality butt joke 
same goes feeling neither very worried progressive vote get split so far biden's numbers moving much it seems warren mostly getting new votes bernie voters hopefully something changes 
elizabeth warren twitter today releasing plan pay medicare for all 
medicareforall finally brings true choice health care system the see doctor want get prescriptions need pick job start small business without worrying insurance come this alone opinion argument good it helps level playing field find new every year employer gets creates freedom ever 
this plan really well done yes political battles fight conceding middle class tax increase huge really contained ones already waging large corporations uber wealthy total liz warren power move 
we live political climate taking position considered bad politics republicans literally healthcare plan trashing obamacare that strategy literally give democrats piece legislation critique side look people to try tear apart offering specifics vision call see applauding candidates willing put decrying 
elizabeth warren's medicare plan really good and important thing back central pledge single payer under no middle class tax everyone covered covers everything this win ms warren elephant room happy 
oh boy this going long weekend get ready folks one big there lot people questions comments praise criticism expect dem candidates strong opinions plan strongly recommend every warren supporter become familiar particular 
one thing like one pay fors cutting defense budget arguably seen form deficit laundering there's historic bipartisan lack fucks given driving deficits spending entirely possible whatever cuts bill entails eventually back case becomes that's upping obviously probably ideal actually stick number reasons clever way exploiting blatant double standard gonna applies left wants expand welfare state blob drop bombs brown people half world away 
i'm pete supporter commenting think warren's plan great political move sure budget nerds able poke holes large headlines keeping raising taxes middle class voters hear def countered pete's recent attacks basically made moot look forward debate issues though good luck 
read plan signed donate however end donating link thank survey the dead huge deal try get fixed asap edit seems issue actblue website entering url browser brought right page 
this political winner primary general election there going people single payer heavily outnumbered look structural imagining healthcare system would save countless lives give middle class historic tax break grassroots movement made win elections 
wow coming different candidates campaign say work put plan blew away there spots thought sounded wonky worrying funding would better bite bullet raise taxes middle class small amount suppose comes election though even done fleshing expenditures really huge achievement don't questions wanted offer genuine congratulations warren supporters amazing proposal 
primary season makes strong candidates stronger prime example nitpicks overall cover weaknesses 
she also says she'll releasing transition plan implement soon sworn might voluntary medicare buy maybe 
better thought would assumed pocket higher income households get roped payment happy this even better everyone freaks make take the tax burden ultra millionaires billionaires less half working families united states in bottom pay wealth taxes top my ultra millionaire tax cent fortunes million tackles head under wealthiest americans only americans going hit extra people moderately well lottery winners these extremely far beyond capable imagining percentage warren talking coupled bring contribution rest country with massive amount portfolio adjustments anyone selling gulfstream making show it wont really hurt let tell 
can get apology twitter asshats pushed liz really support cause right candidate detailed platform paying 
wow comprehensive and almost sounds fantastic she hell writing editing team i'm pretty nitpicky found one typo after review two concerns the health insurance industry employs million people only select executives top raking big bucks rest making normal middle class incomes eliminating private would create monumental upheaval job security believe still question assist individuals many inevitable transitions not mention also administrators hospitals doctors offices etc jobs billing working complicated many risk efficient if something took managed happens this completely true taxes americans go there's section partway congratulates us raise get eliminating premiums paychecks but says revenues pay raised taxing income tax rates sure cheaper premium that's technically higher contribution 
look at my post history everyone owes apology telling wrong called right last debates reason refusing get specific taxes wig flew 
guys good like and love shade thrown mayor pete friends half assedness 
but told actually support bernie bro twitter 
trillion massive much needed redistribution wealth 
holy shit raised taxes middle class that's ridiculous 
my family pays year premiums both childrens births hit deductible we've one er visit urgent care visits scrips roughly household income since medical expenses and consider us lucky we're major illness disaster i'm tired seeing go fund me campaigns sick kids treatment 'unaffordable' this changes everything 
but she doesn't support astroturfers 
where trump plan better cheaper healthcare everyone promised years ago 
granted read much covered let know plan deal physician reimbursements reimbursements declining stagnant keeping pace inflation tackle will savings administrative waste etc also passed better translate quality care because viewpoint medical student effectively taking mortgage finance training i'm medicareforall i've yet anything talks physicians compensated most us mind paycut expecting rich cant tuition cost attendance per year public med school private rising see future slashed 
wealth tax corrective if works supposed generate less revenue would make ultra rich people little poorer also look ways evade lie income redirect money channels there reason many countries abandoned bernie supporter really like liz however using partly fund mistake the deal breaker counted huge priority as plan politically realistic hard implement opposite it tougher sell straightforward funding approach my question return expected what cracking cheats expect would blow hole deficit raise taxes middle class go back promise much easier honest say everyone net save paying mafia insurance company dancing around idea already giving republican corporate democrat framing brings risks actually become president 
someone twitter bernie bot claimed still one warren plan first pointed sanders dodging question payment hopefully saving answer later date as backup link npr story https www npr org bernie sanders wont yet explain would pay medicare refuses admit he'd get told ignore msm narrative 
reading over time employer health care cost per employee would gradually shifted converge average nationally that helps make sure system fair also gives employers employees adapt new so long term tax doesn't disproportionately impact lower wage industries favoring high earners 
job losses might problem we half million insurance salesmen plus it accounting call centers etc support industry 
to calculate new employer medicare contribution employers would determine spent health care last years divide number employees company arrive average cost per employee companies count part time towards total based hours worked year under first all take adjust upwards account overall increase national spending multiply their amount ensuring every paying today pay less still offering comparable private insurance doesn't punish actually contributing allow provide benefits pushed increases skate or reading incorrectly 
this great let's see idiots try ask she'll raise taxes 
let guess carbon copy bernies 
warren backed corner refusing say middle class taxes would rise feel felt necessary able true use suboptimal changes tax policy make happen with broader base including lower robust withstand economic pressures it also palatable overall still far away top choice i'm afraid caved populist sentiment optimal definitely leaves bad taste mouth 
fully believe warren win primary currently support biden mayor pete really moderate candidate pulse her best plans climate they sound would help kickstart new economy could lead something yet see priority think huge waste money short term this coming years national security going threatened change manifests feel like phase action so weirdly enough probably increasing defense spending form things electric grid energy source upgrades coupled clean transportation technological research initiatives the point trying make used go shorter secure better future 
just seems good true increased coverage lower total costs raising taxes in fact increasing take home pay no deductibles co pays full dental vision audio sounds like nice idea little far fetched 
there zero chance even passes one lie middle class taxes would go does mean pay premiums cost sharing no but increase able sustainable long term funding single payer system vast generous warren offering on top version medicare appears still fee service worst things if moved towards capitated payments accountable care organizations enticing even nations either value added payroll maintain stable less plans often administered state provincial municipal level this plan complicate matters what accomplish allowing answer financed although really different said 
plan would immediately put us depression nice 
lmao going raise middle class taxs dead water this pretty much signals become president probably settle public option which bad thing really it's western world 
increase payroll tax middle class people dumb think billionaires even pay percent asset how thr gov actually create anything functional dmv always great 
yep not seem like pretty good plan also great messaging the around healthcare opposition something medicare always tried focus choice taxes pretending takes away glad see turning head telling truth we really right our employers pick insurance doctors allowed with would actually medical care covered could go whichever doctor want one company says then top found way pay without raising working class so even bernie saying yeah save she flat say money get better actual 
so happy see fact dodging middle class tax hike planning around withholding answer found way go liz 
super thorough she provides many options close last bit gap also appreciate takes time say paraphrase 'this possible legitimate reason know says then goes provide essay costs different ways funding 
its increase payments elimination pocket expenses that cuts yearly costs healthcare bigger cut trump gave middle quite bit 
businesses defer cost consumers whatever taxes imposes businesses corporations promising increase middle class absolutely end paid buying 
total bernie sanders power move 
the plan unfortunately well done aspects wealth tax billionaires complete nonstarter she stuck found something else going get wrecked opened weak point having employers contribute great idea implementation looks solid i'm convinced financial transactions could curious would affect volume trade impact macroeconomy dropping accelerated expensing brainier her foreign minimum rate needs accompanied raising domestic corp sure yet 
she needed get grilled exposing hole resume even comprehensive set plans 
this bullshit there absolutely would middle class tax hike the rich going go aw shucks fork in perfect world yeah realistic wish 
right then mayor pete biden kamala act like plans cost lot still require people pay premiums mafia insurance companies the onus always warren bernie answer how are you going pay for it but one asks moderates going still expensive trump hand plan except destroy ac hope free market complete misnomer term magically fixes everything so call nominee socialist say everyone healthcare elected offering substance that satisfy cult members demonize dem candidate get slice independent voters win electoral college 
yes lot speculation cost decreases raised incomes i'm sure headlining attack multi trillion dollar gap expert's estimation estimate factor income changes 
the biggest challenge i've seen bernie supporters potential employers reclassify employees independent contractors avoid paying fund think fear little overblown already abused hopefully extra funding irs would help enforcing existing laws around vs another fact payments based head count rather salaries 
my biggest question see addresses may missed will doctors required accept medicare currently hospitals expressed concern able function lower reimbursement rate 
work dod finance approve message 
but sustainable going financing plan long term especially another president different party takes 
i'm budget nerd healthcare plan addresses things we've saying years implement universal mainly cost cutting combats price gouging big hospitals pharma strong arming stopping greedy practices charging fairly there zero reason non profit hospital executives ceos making tens millions dollars year like criticizing candidates problem allowing private insurance industry continue existing creates two markets providers refuse work medicare altogether choose system lot people go along even costs money love doctors we simply cannot cut par developed countries pay sector manipulating 
i'm sure moot definitely addresses middle class tax question debate the multi trillion dollar hole deficit unaccounted practical implementation methodology tight timeline still worth asking questions glad candidates put thorough thoughtful plans like substantive personal stylistic 
there spots thought sounded wonky worrying funding would better bite bullet raise taxes middle class small amount suppose comes election though this something lot people need get comfortable for worse none candidates running pass plans written 
think arbitrarily increasing wt billionaires sort buys argument liberals want use rich slush fund projects would prefer modest increase premium pegged income progressive marginal percentage starts poverty rate also head tax punish businesses make right move give better healthcare current environment great really know alternative 
the health insurance industry employs million people no roughly worked https www statista com statistics number employees us since that mil involves areas lots some absorbed government jobs arise switch providers may pivot forms like life everyone else likely able find another sector skills highly transferable warren also going releasing transition plan accounts workers losing well 
i'll tackle nitpicky one she carful say no new taxes middle class you get taxed tax rate normal but since income went also higher the key new taxes line true without stating individuals bottom change really like people saying work overtime raises it misunderstanding causes make mistake 
her plans take long time write pulling thin air this goes every economist organization worked come trust professor background she knows get done 
being moderate incremental half assedness you realize rare ever pass huge pieces legislation country medicare passed part kennedy assassinated johnson hell lot political capital spend passing medicaid aside taken great depression recession us kind sweeping if warren elected going long try health plan chances slim none even majority democrats 
the new complaint bernie first completely ignore fact recent quote says answer question haha https www npr org bernie sanders wont yet explain would pay medicare 
found particular talking point annoying bernie bro's would respectfully ask use divisive language like it's sexist male female supporters we better 
screw people warren real deal standing believes 
axe obamacare defund medicare tons savings americans get access many beautiful private insurance plans 
bernie defined funding plan there's really anything compare and includes wealth tax one options her numbers checked economists everything necessarily estimate that's best get point if falls short we've added deficit much less beneficial programs vast majority comes exactly places healthcare today taxes it's weird supporters extremely fiscally conscious actual 
why suddenly worried people exploit labor low wage industries and worth cities like pdx sf already charge employers head tax cover health care afaik affected 
this different current wage structures so actually change anything future right employers pay ton money employer portion health care paycheck something around turning tax means nothing changes 
yeah poor walmart it's like wealthy people costed insure probably less businesses actually insured employees there's real difference for however make pick benefit providing whole time interesting see bernie concerned bottom line shitty employers they forced support regardless way avoiding thus far unethical practices i'm happy give costco competitive advantage supporting 
and yet time jobs need performed federal government likely contractors ten bucks says companies affected wind contracted pretty much they're 
think people overestimate first roles translatable there jobs role allegedly downsized but there's big part everyone forgets do behemoths like bcbs going die just liquidate goes home doubt know dental insurance companies divisions don't provide faster growing making margins division see medical way marketing focused plans guarantee level service extra subsidization even kickback patient picking specific doctor otherwise covered care hell cases might get government contracts stay involved direct process well they dynamic frees drug play everyone's except patient's profit 
thankfully jobs easily transferable industries 
the need manpower evaporate it transition government employees 
medicare reimbursement also low compared private insurance right doctors required accept medicare dont see aspect addressed some hospital administrators expressed concern able exist rate reimbusement 
really see punishment similar college debt forgiveness lenient paid less past mean responsible it also make transition much burdensome first year gradually shifts converge average cost per employee time employers historically treated customers well would significant decline health care spending whereas skated contributing probably even increase 
can't believe seriously making argument maintaining current funding reduce disruption and moving average https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments dq qk elizabeth warren twitter today im releasing nezn you're talking sides mouth is punishment provide insurance employees we know neither good faith 
think backed corner basic plan along needed time run past economists experts make sure held 
yet see priority that's going bankrupt trying pay medical bills would it's hard average person care climate change can't even go doctor 
her number one priority anti corruption while healthcare high list top but every debate spent minutes talking getting better answer ready next if pete much time 
false scarcity there reason bailed banks reduced student debt passed aca two years democratic control 
assuming hillary late swoop keep getting emails asking support 
the plan challenging get covers everything decent detail mainly increasing taxes rich pay it much complex boils oh also forcing companies actually tax profits instead shipping offshore haven's but possible doable if specific questions i'll try find answers 
vats regressive they decent form consumption tax definitely taxes 
vats regressive stop trying make thing 
warren overtakes biden most favorable candidate 
wait till first primaries we'll see support consolidating candidates who's really ahead 
oh comin she yah voters policies presidency 
the economist site passes lot interesting graphics averaged polls it clear exactly though https projects economist com democratic primaries 
much good news already september 
being favorable electable two different things i'm glad see senator warren viewed favorably i'd like poll numbers come bernie bro close second hope one end nominee let's go progressives 
twelve stories high made radiation the present beware future she's coming 
looking polling average graph clear see trendline momentum far 
wow warren strikingly consistent among age demographics that really interesting 
okay future redditor got betting tips 
agreed i'm big fan sanders i've recently really come around warren favorite i'd fucking thrilled either one however 
she's starting lot better national polls better key states like arizona pennsylvania everyone except sanders biden but honest marginally behind it's purely name recognition two ahead 
high favorability especially important female candidate unfortunately good sign 
what blows away latest polls fact practically neck that means gaining support others rather undercutting my big worry biden would coast progressive vote split far happened feel fairly confident there's overlap even poll numbers issues supporting either candidate general prefer warren i'm willing bet one imagine race two fantastic choice 
like sanders id rather keep one two senate push progressive legislation maybe put bullock gov mt going run pull montana battle ground perhaps abrams make ga winnable it might worth go roy cooper nc hopefully swing blue 
if come sub call joke could explain actually troll nobody wants opinion 
also warren tops every single top tier candidates supporters considering list that's huge if harris buttigieg start looking weak voters help pick actual winner likely could tip sanders column stop biden option point got wrapped 
my dream ticket two together care takes role warren sanders team better these working could save nation 
warren abrams would amazing almost good true 
beto would safe bet think especially going southern states potentially swing blue 
has someone trust continue carry bold progressive legislation warren actually fix america she going pick like beto booker whoever shore votes they actual ally cause case something happens that think good chance sanders would gets nomination abrams inslee etc 
this gets brought lot think one elected needs stay senate they much good vp plus add something ticket give candidate broader appeal warren sanders 
think one senate would work better either majority leader help get buy policies puts forth 
personality like cory booker as far ever able tell sincerely good person excellent speaker heartfelt belief people working together better communities 
it's lovely thought need one senate 
think there's real chance warren castro could also happen 
yeah warren top ticket i'd bet someone sun belt vp 
oh yeah unfortunately must return school soon september mind much forget actually yet 
counterpoint vp ticket must committed progressive otherwise they'll another kennedy killed trying pull back mic replaced compliant like johnson given candidates' age even visibly murder plenty health problems could faked

think mean democratic socialist there's something called social democrat warren believes capitalism also strong welfare state left leaning economists 
oh fucking give rest already long consider threatening bust throw poor people color wolves viable method maintaining influence know 
share wish you stop biden voted worst foreign policy disaster modern history forget i'll ensure nobody thousands americans millions iraqis trillions dollars gone decision it's completely unforgivable sorry find acceptable choice party wins one seat government he able appoint far right judges supreme court around country women lose rights minorities lgbtq people has happened yet no even rbg come support justices put bench talk hyperbole oh congress act he's alone what's important sitting vote sign unspeakable privilege selfishness world suffering trump sit i've never sat election pick different candidate need call unacceptably rhetoric unacceptable ha fucking joke disgust fact war sent thousands graves nothing either forgotten forgiven tragedy and led what ignoring entire midwest allowing shit iraq win nomination 
so maybe support someone who's going blindly back anyone solely bc belong political party 
please shoot i'm side in seriousness mean attack democrats general think dnc leadership clear favorite race much liked clinton wrong called give credit staying pretty neutral time around though 
if still believe years trump either dangerously naive plain trying promote conservative interests

sucked yesterday voted bernie last progressive race excited horrible things camp hurled towards liz sanders failed expand support beyond core group supports they're denial candidate they're looking someone else blame warren easy scapegoat they live bubble 
i'm fan biden numbers nathan talking it looked like bernie pretty solidly even got jump warren endorsement would 
yep this quintessential sandersism absolutely convinced right anyone disagrees person different viewpoint enemy it produce ideologically pure militantly loyal fanbase putting everyone else if sanders acolytes like robinson flexible accepting alternative views could build larger coalition loved warren progressive opinions act someone even slightly moderate must malevolent corporate shill trying oppress proletariat

the weird thing i've got progressive ideas line warren's but warren supporters started aggressive rude online think i'd stop believing striving said progress 
how pro warren post simply anti bernie via supporters nate silver worst 
he's trying piss anyone he's pit progressives maintain corporate banker status quo 
honest god would guys feel situation reversed bernie failed endorse warren would still saying yes wants say wow can't believe stubborn like he'll sink campaign 
outside box she betrayed every single progressive ideal ever existed inside differences bernie liz minuscule need band together save progressivsm 
this shit reddit bernie buster considering warren called sanders sexist tried make whole thing gender so much unity candidate also jesus warren supporters wtf not uniting under candidate just because some people were mean to you online guess never really progressives bonus actually happened the contents private conversation two candidates leaked media source unclear alleging told believe woman could win trump field day asked next debate claimed never said president allegation went campaigning clinton when disagreed immediately pivoted general terms talking women winning elections recently apparently enough toxic base alienate anyone camp feel entitled vote everything tear you heart attack lie releasing medical records dismiss call release details paying plans show bleeding eyeball fail finish coherent thought debates god forbid apologize change story male says nuh uh time 
think argument lot fanatic bernie supporters make fact endorse proof former latter not agree mind wanted share folks generally frame 
that great take reminds contradicting arguments people made dubya is bumbling dumb hick worried nuclear codes or leader vast conspiracy bidding military industrial complex systematically destroying social safety net 
that's amazing he calls unity sanders ahead moment warren pulls polls starts viciously attacking 
lol that used gender studies court male entitlement looks like 
gee dramatic anti warren face happened coincide topping polls coincidence i'm sure 
honestly understand respected newspaper entertains troll 
to clear warren endorsed bernie election blew people apply arguments make hillary clinton fans angry staying long 
they're gonna lose matter they've always better burning bridges building learn damned thing 
think numbers shrunk artificially high depth analysis back found vote never hillary people instead true supporters those show obviously time around became head race see michigan result seems like pretty much money he expanded core group enough 
also biden really well warren core constituency that dumb figure sanders close policy wise it coalition fairly broad terms ideology united belief best person job without race went different ways 
really think years look back warmly remembered someone brought attention real problems americans face warren assuming biden presidency one attack issues congress though 
her polices similar willing say really going get seemingly impossible policies finish line commit if want progressive agenda like follow bernie infallable demigod warren would way support huge facts even though bernie's stances better supported real deal she seemed could actually gotten things work 
don underestimate power bada bing boom it effective policy 
bernie sanders extremely talented inspiring democrats policies ideology and become much popular within party country direct result effectiveness messaging he's also terrible building bridges create majority that's needed actually seize power get implemented 
oh god he truly get https mobile twitter com nathanjrobinson status i'm sorry say ever thought smart 
dude's crazy saw video posted trying argue warren supporters switch supporting bernie expected know arguments instead like mins rambling sanders better without substantive points pointed made particularly persuasive already supporter started getting attacked decided unsubscribe breadtube time heaven forbid try engage discussion 
can't take person takes fashion tips joker seriously 
can't get sense entitlement candidate supporters alike 
agree think described cultural problem the culture bernie campaign exactly combative but reality set top his leadership style fosters kind othering divisive rhetoric look warren true progressive built inclusion coalition building objective that came if wanted would sound like build especially nevada strong favorite he could switched inclusive argument predicated goliath rage enemy sees actually bunch voters billionaires normal worried citizens so scolds us establishment dog whistle terms followers use neoliberals democratic corporatists etc talking people needs votes white middle class suburban women economically diverse black older minority immigrant enough billionaire swing election biden bloomberg shown anything far primary money weirdly important states spend single dollar even spent half billion dollars american samoa rage establishment made female 
exactly still disagree principle joe selling trump aberration go back normal instead progressives see symptom deeper rot system but voters demonstrably believing message it helps the one thing propping economy tumbling also biden popular among middle aged older democrats know blocs vote bernard brothers stuck ideological purity explicitly progressive candidate apparently according win implement said policy politics team sport 
support progressive agenda nothing important removing donald trump yup really depends congress republican senate progress small democratic majority modest held back conservative timid congresspeople big bold so winning big thing anyone that said hard make good faith argument warren stronger candidate yeah sanders entered already similar except better fleshed explained sigh guess could argue foresaw name recognition would really mattered know foreordained 
yeah turn numbers biden michigan promising he seems inspired lot support thought gone forever trump as long minimize gaffes picks dynamic female vp get behind think going defeat fairly handily coat tails deliver ticket races well 
honestly biggest problem biden politics the obama era neoliberal agenda good enough years it'll huge improvement trump administration but undeniable fact biden's health deteriorated significantly past four there's reason staff keeps stump speeches short interviews minimal debate performance rambling in terms mental feel guy election i'm terrified see go it's thrives belittling insults shouting people base loves expects something even show stage yell rant par going beneficial campaign trump's 
ready vote joe trump simply path victory pretty clear televised debate biden much used like vp hard time putting sentences together point donald bread butter rhetoric all takes slip ups don making look outclassed unfortunately politics mostly professional wrestling it matter better policy cut promo 
joe biden would veto healthcare reform being moderate draw voters hence hillary losing swing states there's absolutely nothing trump yet who's possible get go support moderates make gaff give lengthy answers actual substance easy paint establishment exactly kind candidate plays perfectly trump's narrative carefully rehearsed statements focus grouped appeal many demographics backfire someone like they seem authentic far dangerously people see honest 
oh fail expand support lost the white working class midwestern biden bernie years ago 
honestly know would done dropped able vote primary admit agree bernie things biden also think ego maniac blaming deep state establishment inability expand base sucks decided enter race shortly warren actually someone pull moderates left whereas clueless 
consider progressive truly like bernie sanders way he's run campaign the rhetoric us vs fighting establishment lack democratic endorsements sends huge red flags fact fellow though think i'm going start using term 'warren democrat' feel welcome bernie's coalition movement indicative inability expand hell even hold onto base enthusiastic supporter 
https twitter com nathanjrobinson status it looks like nathan responding another person sana saeed idea claiming unspecified cnn analyst said warren voters went vote biden mi primary they implying rather explicitly stating reason bernie well bad look looking someone blame take accountability 
because riffs nowhere nearly bad want leverage endorsement exchange jobs next administration bernie sinking warren already facing embarrassment lost ma primary doubt lower standing risk burning bridges president endorsing candidate go lose spectacularly this likely even remember it thinking strategically clear progressive able win nomination chooses inject progressivism moderate could case pushing policies absence viable 
the dumb media twitter narrative bernie warren progressive everyone else moderate never mind yang's ubi would mean gov't spending bernie's plans combined

do think possible still striving progress different way that ways strive especially looking long term nothing bernie 
think anyone giving values why would say stop weird oh bernie fan base 
he already failed endorse warren back heart attack momentum if endorsed progressives may chance or least refrained attacking left fucking ludicrous ally issue supposedly important dont really give fuck bernie supporters think anymore their behavior torpedoed hope winning election showed adept pulling moderates progressive policies repelling closest allies shrinking coalitions but truthfully didnt numbers matter path would taken liz bernies pete's peaks enough 
and making woman responsible man's words actions including putting onus dig hole put gender politics writ large note yang dropped supporters demand endorse sanders even though supporter because man men get agency women hand valuable loyalty expected sublimate ambitions serve even would actually future disadvantage 
that's blatant simplification though she could chosen say misunderstanding come agree show similarities refuse terrible cnn behavior but accepted sexist smear name people upset what's happened warren unfortunate since that's what's bernie supporters considerate less violently vocal think unite around see structural problem america structure colossal power support suppression dissent across fields being angry us looks like today pretty fair response it's excuse toxic stand way movement claiming surprised edit alright clearly get anywhere discussion generic talking points arguments already tried reply pissed sad turned you truly deserve want take away wrote point arguing 
there no guarantee warren voters will line up behind sanders https fivethirtyeight com features theres guarantee warren voters line behind sanders morning consult morningconsult biden expect near equal gain warrens exit instance found percent supporters would opt second choice choose biden and recent ipsos reuters poll www ipsos sites default files ct news documents topline reuters election tracker pdf loyalties evenly split picking backing made difference bloomberg also people could gotten endorsement endorse yang booker gilibrand castro beto harris said want friends still running endorsed dropped hell tulsi gabbard instead endorsing bernie it's warren's fault what campaign bring wider coalition why natural allies alienated this shoulders 
the possibility sanders nomination real moderates race acted quickly consolidate support south carolina had progressive wing party done think bernie would super tuesday riding momentum joe respectfully fantasy american electorate turned droves overwhelmingly supported biden warren endorsing day changed significant way people yet policy positions 
bernie would never accomplish platform he lacks talent work others warren saw everyone outside bubble extend divisive primary knew loss last night hard enough finally stops attacking hope left presidency 
yeah she isnt required support anyone independent human decisions make time everyone sit fuck patient decide endorse either old ass white dudes repeatedly sexist fucking power honestly want it's her choice course quiet also whatever say they including bernie perfect patriarchal view woman agree nice pleasant fuck fucked deal consequences win race need rely endorsement someone they've spent months demonizing not problem 
bernie literally nomination fingers resounding victory nevada most voters still undecided point susceptible messaging did try unify party pivot towards unity bring suburban moderates southern blacks strength electability argument no he stated republican establishment democratic get fucking frontrunner embarked fidel castro apology tour don't blame electorate bernie's asinine campaigning skills 
you severely underestimating damaging bernie surrogate attacks warren supporters actually 
where could endorsement made difference sure maybe washington that biden winning nomination black voters south suburban women voted hrc cycle stuck pete amy liz they hate bernie settle no changed damn thing 
want preface saying bernie always number two i'm fine endorsing one by time warren dropped lot support already migrated perhaps others waves the first wave fall smeared walking back medicare she pace front runner numbers bernie's rose second came said situation occurred january called snake based interpretation discussion last th place finish new hampshire people lost faith switched candidates states voted so left likely kinds supporters supports approximately divide would go people like well researched progressive policies remained persistent end probably vote policy supported detailed brought receipts may they're value pragmatism rather grand gestures 
except even bernie democratic candidate would lose trump landslide radical candidates galvanize support opposition https www nytimes com opinion negative partisanship democrats republicans html 
you're getting downvotes person similar journey st choice elizabeth nd bernie think two things might made difference yang immediately fervently endorses upon dropping race warren those along could really swayed people but understand like smart enough play game extend voice ever obama also understood they calculated works the gross part ridiculous power struggle and may done right thing now job make sure tear candidates create ammunition side general get dem office participate earlier stronger next time actual progressive good candidate fair chance 
username literally nra eva anyone believe ever warren supporter 
she needs take good hard look bernie's slogan if shoe foot i'd like wtf bernie endorsed yet trump beats biden prominent endorsers get voted

i'm warren supporter deserves president america 
necessarily know america deserves sure hell need this great post support warren absolutely think unique candidate fix trump broken can't another like presidency make significant improvements americans' lives time

loved new yorker cartoon earlier week 
here example show real argument make via twitter https twitter com deanomartin status look wearing she always day wears clothes black sleeveless leotard top yoga pants sleeve pastel unzipped sweatshirt type this creepy af either bought bags smells bad 
as rule love new yorker hate cartoons this amazing 
this new yorker it look like regular style also old joke always improved replacement caption work christ asshole 
cute highlights difference ew practically angel devil office millions skeletons closet what relief would potus the downside cartoon completely obscures warrior comes fighting system works us 
elizabeth everybody wishes hillary clinton actual 
if bernie fan base would try carpet bomb main office even think cool 
why add republican like years 
think cartoon sexist she obviously though person minimizing 
betcha never complained man wearing dark suit everyday 
people get snippy dont real criticism 
can conform smells fine gives nice side hug take selfies 
seriously this something people actually say did thing steve jobs jeesh 
whereas bernie wears rumpled blue suit omg humble 
for part agree connect hit park 
emily flake artist judging art style she hilarious 
from cartoon get sense woman would eaten alive trump debates know true real liz fierce dem especially biden undermines 
they extremely different politicians it make sense compare aside fact women 
feel bad bernie he's great he's attracted rude uninformed voters 
skeleton closet something secret political career pretty open 
think this comic drawn woman huge warren supporter the gist example several rape accusations actual serious shit someone like trump background 
while i've never met elizabeth warren like grandma nothing wrong good person nice think cartoon speaks character in way minimize say implies something tough besides one toughest people ever seen next badass theater lighting manager fought vietnam carries around container quarters give kids buy stuff vending machines being cute old make weak 
madam president bruce would first man 
nope and wear different one tan 
probably steve jobs famously wore black turtlenecks jeans 
they never paid attention white men wearing begin klan hoods nazi armbands clogs maga hats 
understand tbh would want expect candidate cannibal sort sex scandal past horrible failing is really hard believe people worst maybe call mom enough bit awkward sometimes that's extent badness people like warren strive put office 
the best i've seen bernie sub huge thread trying answer comment saying healthcare plan looks good someone find holes use discussions week some people's kids smh 
her hugs amazing she warm genuine got hug las vegas pride literally running place giving snapping selfies giant rainbow boa 
yes sense articulate concern cartoon at live rally get see integrity fearlessness fierce determination any concerns warren getting pushed around debate trump replaced blissful images tough schoolmarm dragging bully detention ear lecturing exactly trouble in primary debates think liz motivated avoid attacking fellow democrat but may right could benefit strategic use sharp slap downs we've seen forums 
unfortunately that's enough quite lot people 
leading party's nomination running president united states america could compared obama want anybody 
do think symbolic significance candidate running first female president united states 
while agree it's important remember sexism done women people support 
unacceptable almost bad preferring dijon mustard 
they're fine tan suits https www thecut com mitch mcconnell suit html long white 
were clogs racist clothing one time 
fair say sane people agree different basic boring good person quarterback 
infighting nothing good if warren wins primary need sanders supporters 
there literally hundreds people run president many assume ideal candidate men so think necessary compare warren clinton little common gender 
she exactly like obama comes office barely attempts campaigned 
think point women can't sexist even trying supportive case circumstances context mitigating factor rather amplifying one 
also see deficits debt executive orders 
in fairness blind partisanship they attacked clinton absurd shit yeah racism gop even hatred democrats 
the article criticizing terrible suit 
you appear trying twist comment sort gender biased statement the significant thing common elizabeth warren sub reddit compared previous frontrunner happened think really weak pick wanted run definitely content bernie race we got stuck poor candidate instead went lose predictable reasons compare obama liked way fact go back frontrunners past century recent races make sexist asshole assume paint 
trying twist comment paint anything honestly intending highlight rebut problematic way looking candidates based superficial characteristics lot people my less culture reflex boxing women if want warren succeed candidate talk merits clinton radically different terms style substance comparing helpful ignores ways unique highlights real similar gender additionally considering one greatest weaknesses electability word used stand uncertainty female president highlighting instead focusing ideas often by goes non stop comparisons every black politician obama people deserve judged

the chance keep dreaming big fighting change continues hopefully give us boost need win iowa nomination 
just donated do part circulate article maximize impact endorsement 
so pumped guys things looking good iowa polls recently fantastic news especially electorate still largely undecided lfg 
but getting told sanders supporters quit split progressive vote guess stick campaign 
because sure people wondering endorsement paul simon caucus winner dick gephardt democratic nominee michael dukakis no iowa senator tan potus everyone basically skipped campaigning caucus bill bradley al gore john edwards kerry hillary clinton barack obama elizabeth warren 
trolls but seriousness glad got endorsement 
this good news folks saying endorsements really important right word i'm looking am i've full cup coffee yet forgive point however another positive pile hoping people ia see least read article if decided may give warren look whether translates votes anyone's guess but crowded field anything pushes head line even briefly imho 
certain elements politics mass downvoting news switch controversial find posts 
thank goodness worried would go someone else 
the bad news record endorsing eventual caucus winner democratic side https www desmoinesregister com story opinion editorials endorsement history register endorsements good past performance effect future turn around work hard 
most people cool they'll tell they're voting if someone else thank hangup move next one it's really bad best group especially wary do needs done 
congrats liz different first choice think would lead us many great changes country 
awesome congrats y'all she's personal think definitely deserving

which potential voters endorsement going sway mean get wrong still great news matter much 
just signed another phone bank week who match 
absolutely agree sent lot texts weekend feels great contribute was able chat several undecided voters warren short list for anyone fence volunteering time jump easy schedule 
my dream line warren amy performing better sanders iowa 
just air things bit better gannett co inc des moines register owner guts the new york times company ceo arthur ochs sulzberger jr 
totally disagree assessment painting think iconic presidential well said otherwise 
it's really fun i'm already jan 
she got well informed vote seems 
yes agree jump larger bit also trying keep expectations check said lfg my personal guess based nothing high pt couch potato 
whenever see john edwards name think man guy could president shudder 
incredible just needed well want feel better preet bharara's podcast interviewed top iowa pollster ann selzer episode born poll said basically way win peak fast instead slowly build that seems warren one largest bases st nd choice sander's narrow when add endorsement des moines register like that's 
the endorsement nothing good news warren it's like candidates saying whoa hope get des moines register person endorse always win wonder one things hurting among voters impression radical lumped another truly candidate this type helps show mainstream 
it's important keep mind endorsement better persuading undecided caucus goers lot time not saying get warren nomination obviously think we're also different times 
their endorsements translated nominees frequently gop memory serves 
til senator named paul simon 
can anyone guess much affect improve poll numbers warren nervous slipping polls regardless nyt endorsement 
in almost every instance endorsed better candidate nominee ultimately except obama doesn bode well 
there many trolls politics sub cant even get story front page yet 
also good news nate silver claims endorsement adds points polling average terms ultimate caucus standing 
the good news past performance effect future turn record around work hard and reach say election previous atypical unpredictable 
it actually pretty big especially considering close race ia my first guess bring college educated whites pete back 
the number undecided voters iowa higher usual point race endorsement could end mattering quite bit 
people really like want wanted caucus worried electability 
so many still undecided iowa right yes matter 
undecideds candidates chance hitting threshold 
your concern entirely unwarranted that said iowa voters could still change mind support

bless heart warren still rejecting donations wealthy knew talking know illegal super pac coordinate directly campaign includes donating funds sure shoe horn somewhere help get foot mouth have pleasant day 
for last time super pacs cannot donate campaigns there difference independent pac spending direct campaign donations her fundraising include anything persist organization contributing directly illegal warren literally nothing private just like bernie biden money groups supporting unlike pete buttigeg article abc news https abcnews go com politics otus super pac short history story id explaining the internet amazing resource use responsibly mil days grassroots supporters thehill homenews warren says raised million amp over debate day and per town hall specifically said three since alone donors avg contribution perhaps watch pay close attention here link need start around youtu axkcxdlplsq lfg

the troll farm really hitting social media hard line i've seen least dozen times one twitter thread 
note sub huge donation upsurge correlates exactly warren received we several matching threads put queue one time think candidates seem understand really long haul 
no moreso bernie's nurse's union super pac actually perhaps less since new warren started week connection publicly decried 
im progressive amy second how why would vote candidate espouse policies 
he maintains our revolution super pac despite fact operates exactly like one benefit it's unusual level dissembling 
our revolution otherwise known dark money group it accept unlimited contributions source required publicly disclose donors unlike super pacs names making less transparent pacs https campaignlegal org update pacs super dark money groups whats difference took million anonymous gave limits six figure sums this data tax filings till publically revealed yet presidential election apnews com bbd af cfb fa ab

oh okay thanks clarification wanted informed armed knowledge confronted undecideds anti warrens 
are candidates allowed publicly decry coordination 
except national nurses united super pac nurses' union persist new wont disclose donors april well tuesday 
this true nurses union need disclose donors fairly unlikely billionaire going donate we also know stand the persist superpac exactly kind dark money liz rightfully called election political career these pacs solely created skirt around campaign finance laws act direct financial support campaigns they tied existing democratic institution like movement based org sunrise etc 
because bernie gotten little done decades politics he career politician want someone knows create consensus stuff actually gets sanders able get anything warren klobuchar democrat plenty reverse damage created trump also concerned voting another cult leader we spent last years guy supporters call media fake hold accountable everything questioning conspiracy aggressive mob harassing anyone disagrees part 
removed keep civil report comment move please 
yeah donations super pacs unlimited 
no one knows the fec irs weak since citizens united pretty much thing can't get away straw donations foreign source 
true also throw our revolution disclose donors 
yea like our revolution bernie started actively violating campaign finance laws so anyone attacks warren super pacs look candidate first revolution disclose donors election dark money something lost changed mind 
the persist superpac exactly kind dark money liz rightfully called election political career that's true slightest bad faith reckless suggest 
wow this rude comment totally makes want vote someone else thanks

talking plan he literally announced days liz warren's debate sure stole headlines no harm found funny get traction 
but warren's based family income let already wealthy get free education people schools 
how attack bernie in fact often hear supporters criticizing warren saying copying agenda this show talking issue elizabeth subreddit know share related news clips 
bernie spends way much time base seem understand never make majority electorate there effort reach everyone supposed come it telling week debate ama looked unprepared his priorities get across finish line wrote two years ago even send back form letter the matters matter small gets heart may right place strategy straight disappointing people campaign team assholes though generally agree political views 
consider watching speak he extremely good articulating points plus pew research poll americans said vote otherwise qualified gay man wouldnt woman dont believe either accurate face trump besides voter forget sexuality candidate easier attributes 
socialism workers means production why would worker incentive work socialism partial owner get cut profits wouldn less hard capitalist system go one person 
that sound better it's good choosing excellent candidates like warren sanders single person answers able change everything let's hope kamala biden etc fall hard 
as someone disowned family drop college right graduation get parents tax forms student allowed seen separate person basing ability financial aid poor love anymore pushed back years 
universal universal as long separate wealthy always benefit

elizabeth warren kamala harris looked like winners at the first debates poll 
backing elizabeth no wall street influence way enter office 
honestly much love castro i'm starting come around idea warren harris ticket know progressives gripes included candidate perfect record two women contrast trump pence would representation democratic party today 
if comes warren vs harris win 
warren still first choice feeling harris continue effective debates would probably trump debate 
interest voting anyone warren bernie think kamala great my hope chill bit everyone else attacks lmao 
think warren clear cut winner thought playing defense stay comfort zone she trending well need big gotcha moment bernie way really kamala going moments lacked substance castro surprise went beto supporting immigrants i'm saying he's anywhere near favorite positive movement 
really being kamala former prosecutor feel skills debating trump but like warrens got plan warren definitely campaign laid 
would warren harris ticket viable 
please vote daily kos post debate straw poll https dailykos com stories democratic presidential straw poll first edition 
also came away impressed pete buttigieg hope spelt correct 
why constantly pick pictures two women screening angry wish ever would dignified these amazing 
real question though going win voter machine rigging election interference foreign powers efficient propaganda trump worried we amazing candidates it mean shit deck stacked 
while hearing warren oklahoma still gives coastal elite vibe really demographic trying capture castro also well spoken debate help south compared harris seems like redundant choice capturing vote less baggage 
but also attack democratic candidate happy support kamala general election come together beat trump even wall street influence 
warren buttigieg ticket would take wind coastal elite attacks republican party dishes edit image harris booker ticker better suited appealing pocs though 
warren booker ticket would interesting one 
prefer harris ag she would incredible 
know progressives gripes harris included sanders disappointed seem time prepare debate ama certain subreddit consider home toxic strand base what important pick candidates broader democratic unite behind exactly vocal activists reddit want ive spoke lot people moderate like warren explain big proposals length feels dream reflected supporters act they also tend complaints every politician criticism valid it healthiest group catering first place large amount needed deal versus reliable votes actually get return that long standing problem american far left really bad 
warren castro would choice staying point calm attacks sharp critiques without coming across angry 
last time presidential candidate chose another primaries running mate curious see idea bounced around seem like kind thing ever happens make sense take two people almost completely overlapping fanbases one ticket rather senate instead vp 
you think trump keep pence around 
honestly happy maybe minus two three became president instead trump 
every single candidate including marianne williamson would win debate trump after debates really seem matter 
i've warren first buttigieg sanders following harris shot think may overtake sanders' spot 
harris would make seem like old disconnected racist warren moron both merits 
personally think warren would effective trump debates take bait get pulled level hillary spent much time attacking see harris thing 
my hope warren pulls ahead sanders endorses 
luckily lot desperate people range otherwise messaging seems hold hands sing kumbaya focusing trump person rather broken system lead 
actually thought bernie worse warren maybe craziness day seemed game dodgey questions 
agree warren pull punches really debate anyone but go along said maybe she questions directed straight fight screen time 
agree along line love warren think going far way which smart since night quickly forgotten meaning also need much people serious competition why take risk early 
she prob win night one debated like would gotten run i'm saying capable standing lights shine brighter hope bit outspoken next 
warren land punches need everyone busy going beto looked like smart adult fray 
really he dropped several spots view his whole people buy medicare seems disingenuous buying health care plan called premium reason all important afford premiums deductibles purpose provide services without choice debate really considering 
let please buy bullshit right wing framing coastal elites 
attack open discussion long advances insane notion bad trump we need dialog would never happy vote candidate allows wall street influence reinstatement glass steagall beginning seem taboo cutting military budget but certainly voting democratic obviously even next democrat president simply kicks road retires huge speakers fees least better advancing closer dictatorship that's sort thing brought us it's obvious fox republicans lie focusing desirable dirt candidates bring table so less democratic fewer money ties it needs priority 
still want buttigieg run statewide office indiana challenging governor eric holcomb might difficult given popularity senator todd young vulnerable 
i'd read warren pete cover 
warren buttigieg appeal voters mostly high information upper middle class whites it kind redundant ticket however also polls pretty well amongst black strongly disliked polling this week feeling like winning booker 
not really race make appealing poc harris booker behind biden warren sanders problematic upholding systemic racism upheld overly harsh sentencing plus allowed prison allow sikh man hired since remove turban corey way close wall street banking sector predatory lending targeted redlined obtaining good quality housing castro klobuchar buttigieg abrams much better vp candidates less baggage 
the thing trump rust belt someone middle america ticket would go long way swinging rural working class voters 
would frame representing pocs people color want represented seat table not appeal correct thing 
considering talks hows best person prosecute trump think job angling 
truth her talents wasted vp 
prefer someone much stronger record supporting disenfranchised powerful harris dynamite side 
if referring wayofthebern press secretary obviously know better sanders sandersforpresident toxic posters entirely captured while think someone staff way motivated reigning supporters' toxicity terrible legitimate friendly territory could 
what important pick candidates broader democratic base unite behind exactly vocal activists reddit want actually what's nominate candidate enact policies benefit people for warren sanders not sure who's distant third choice yet 
think obama biden primaries and i'm sure harris warren much overlapping support might help know dominant second choice pick supporters 
good question heard rumors know bad trump's track record cabinet member retention see reason pence leave yet 
think anyone could worse trump 
not sure unpopular opinion find marianne williamson deeply unimpressive rhetorically she'd lot better less racist far know hateful eager suck kim jong un praise moral reprobates around world terms effective leader global stage i'd still worried 
nah williamson would win power love 
tbh marianne would probably great debate trump in terms qualified well genuinely understand enact platform without handing someone else they're exactly 
to reasonably intelligent person yes but average voter likely perceive debates little differently 
problem harris prosecutor part problem claims champion she also flipped flopped progressive issues sit well admittedly excellent debating come handy next debates for bernie warren first spot yang everyone else distant third and lastly biden dude colorado thanks 
does either actually matter though hillary made seen pole racist moron still 
though supported bernie like fear even mere fact running right testament ego the obvious coalition building progressive choice warren yet sanders runs would take end 
he quickly mathematically running don expect drop race 
he seem kind annoyed couple questions early but think killed closing remarks 
think he knew road long he'll still standing months there reason score points 
think correct approach really hope main stage second debate faith handle attacks jabs candidates country see skills people might lacks ability take trump 
interesting much preferred night one vibe seemed substantive little less combative sake standing also tired assumption match trump terms beat he great debater natural bully plays debate stage stand listen buffoon five minutes want vote someone left 
agreed different strategy different competitors she frontrunner night one needed minimal effort leave i'm bashing plan either it's good think winning debate 
think dems super nervous get behind true means getting rid insurance many americans like coverage so bet trying toe line piss either side debate same harris recant day 
that premium would exist sliding scale according income if sanders style exists form taxes 
want break dividing democrats rule interested google kamala harris prosecution history there's nyt op ed that's really gets unprogressive parts record district attorney general 
native hoosier party id hell drug in one trajectory red it sucks pete looking platform outside first run dnc chair potus 
want buttigieg run house rep seat south bend district democrat the incumbent republican election margin points respectively in vulnerable think great shot winning it also give federal government experience future presidential 
no matter primaries turn last see buttigieg he's rising star guaranteed least senate seat vp president 
that true warren harris booker definitely good choices balanced ticket approach 
agree though think democratic party would love vp strong rust belt roots since taking back michigan pennsylvania wisconsin seems like surest path victory atm klobuchar performs really well minnesota getting luke warm reception national stage bernie real areas get nomination see wanting imo he'd kind wasted opposed senator anyway castro booker harris might translate bump minority demographics help flip florida could winning strategy i'll tearing hear election night presidency comes fucking 
strongly disliked right diagnosis struggles black voters large barely starting tune they'll move away familiar names like bernie biden new candidates 
now think julian castro would top choice vp warren there many candidates hard keep track 
maybe warren castro ticket i'm definitely happy booker though 
while true warren really midwest lol like since think sanders get nod would better served senate opposed vp harris everyone else meh 
even aware ama wotb that honestly nauseating frankly poor use senator time go debate week while toxicity lower compared total cesspools like still centerpiece many sanders based conspiracy theories think seen much better days agree disagree level no new votes echo chamber though he reddit demographic needs work expanding brand instead sings song getting tired hearing premise 
what fear sanders presidency would disaster send back progressive movement decades see track record good governance ability get things done 
i'm certain deck cards if shit ever hits fan that's easy way shake things get news he need court religious right anymore bet would consequences voters 
dunno suppose website graphics still pence's name probably 
indeed pence still pretending loyal someone trump confide probably if sacks might suddenly change abandon basically they're using

the part makes question leadership regards web trolls bullies he four years figure it well known target malicious campaigns yet sanders chosen thought best let online campaign go vodka fueled lord flies bender either supported malice incapable stopping if cannot maintain progressive message how'd expect inspire faith could follow congress populism poor politics 
it moot beat biden esp bloomberg bernie second choice however completely understand agreeing ideologically faith leader he staked whole political strategy reaching working congress outsider grassroots organizing rallying leaning democratically thing become clear movement simply mean harassing doxxing bullying using homophobic ableist slurs towards anyone everyone participate actions thinks ineffective wrongly directed practices class unity suddenly goes window lockstep people much farce come see economic anxiety finally affected white liberals radicalized online coopted progressive message minus inclusivity intersectionality reduced praxis calling pete buttplug they real revolutionary ideology internet game believe righteous effective still progressivism though excited post takes us edit add whenever point problem male rage inevitably sanders supporter says case diverse base which true learned black activists civil rights south american revolutionaries platform color built but thing never harassed threatening dms woman or and rarely even man part men ruin else

disabled people use single plastic straws drink alternatives work everyone many uses disabled need https ramblingjustice wordpress com infographics strawban suckitableism advocates here's helpful graphics info explain suggest always great we hold companies accountable pass vulnerable populations something fairly small compared commercial waste making request public places reduces straw usage similar things water refills back california drought big changes made without harming i've heard lot others dismissing concerns saying asked question people ask well fact aspirated got bacterial viral infections especially immune compromised persons puncture injuries metal choking etc died and say bring issue us someone normally forgets inconvenienced for person mean cannot ingest fluids food therefore accessibility adaptation businesses least hand else access parts life 
super hard ton disabled people drink anything unless straw take person moderate severe parkinsons example 
kamala harris stated climate town hall would ban fracking well 
warren made clear lock them up train 
its difference someone politics want power truly feels help real desire make things better we entirely much first type almost none last 
you've forgotten obama already he zero scandals biggest 'crime' smoked pot youth 
oh see saying disagree completely thank making point polite manner 
yep single use plastic straws originally created disabled person's before aspiration infection puncture injuries even death happening due alternatives mostly metal time 
so much fixed country appoint regulators lobbyists head departments there's ton corruption gets ignored that's 
the senate and something done courts all takes one federal judge scotus decision anything warren democrat passes gets stopped 
i'm sure part disagree npr great thing explaining https www npr org sections thesalt people disabilities want bans plastic straws flexible well cnn washingtonpost many major news outlets sorry seem bit defensive access life death feel privilege able accessibility accommodation it would like saying ramps doors someone get counter height wash hands seated 
the first patent straw sumerians years ago used straws get created disabled people put death often reach sedimentary byproducts fermentation get crap mouth drank beer 
yeah can't say agree obama he decent great kulinski video tan suit scandal line bs 
oh good cited least one source instead bleating like mindless shee oh 
disagree part entire sum humanity needs use straws people find medically necessary you obviously expected logical response preemptively attempted address issue bringing straw dug hole much deeper might well arguing everyone forced wear giant plastic bibs unable keep soup polo shirts sure shirt whole situation argue 
think misunderstood read comment completely specifically stated single use plastic straws which absolutely created disabled people first rolled hospitals institutions 
it started appearing kulinski talk origins my guess david brock moderate dem propagandist 
you need list obama's war crimes all illegal shit office this well reported presidency responding absolutely absurd comment flippantly 
they say entire sum humanity must using plastic straws said businesses hand requested considerate may need you still argue comparison bibs pretty outside scope point oc trying make find hard believe anyone arguing universal straw ban interested forcing use like comment getting 
hospitals among first embrace bendable straws allowed patients drink lying bed these still made paper all progressed plastic eventually easier manufacture it nothing disabilities wwii especially manufacturing use initially used convert non wartime uses 
his video response chris hayes segment but tbh normal whitewash former presidents contrast trump easy 
just like stairs elevators everyone able welcome fact encouraged use but elevator need or airports carts seating four people needs ride service thankfully fun note flights follow ada legal standing unique know local place cellulose corn straws single plastic ones allergies i'm allergic stability straw friend life threatening allergy motor issues uses absolutely want reduce waste they sign bucket saying available request keep behind counter simple method said hardly ever get anyone asking reduced lot 
believe making bad faith argument completely misunderstood conversation 
also many reasons paper straws always work disabled people hospitals preferred plastic dissolved quickly especially patients ate drank slowly well hot liquids they allowed drink bed exactly adaptation needed see aspiration choking puncture wounds the another and yes cheaper demand preceded switch history often washed positionable single use created either way original point absolutely still stands for first ten years hospitals institutions only spread general population since longer shut usually need maybe listen voices there lot information want understand straw bans protested disabilities maybe try kinder less quick anger without reading whole comment 
you misconstrued businesses straws available disabled people everyone required use the person responding one arguing bad faith 
believe misunderstood conversation well businesses thing everyone discussing it's bad faith argument suggest we're talking forcing people kitchens think saying 
aggressive someone trying explain well something history important disabled people you acknowledge read initial comment incorrectly continued indeed meant introduction hospitals institutions yes creating though daughter drinking milkshake gave first idea my original point told get said one responded agreed so i'm confused go feel maybe misunderstanding can try see view 
the billionaires counter enough liquid pay tax year they'll sell assets foreigners not really problem letting know point view 
it's time turn billionaires millionaires 
you afford private sex island ftfy 
let repossess islands big brain time 
though feel smart rich person would simply change citizenship move wealth overseas keep mansions us then maintain annual month tourist visa live completely avoid tax without significantly impacting lifestyle winter summer home 
it actually and consider requires liquidating assets pull capital gains taxes mushrooms that's assuming tax ordinary income rates makes closer repeated every single year wealth drops 
who cares point view if horded obscene wealth time start paying they glad swap rates capitol gains income actual work billionaires sad might sell assets boo fucking hoo try blood 
i'll tell government can't pay taxes owe currently liquid since locked things like food rent 
the non billionaire counter afford good idea first place at level wealth assets notoriously hard value assess house others neighborhood sell last year private island there's also fundamental problem paying programs taking massive means need society continues produce if years plan tax base cut half probably sustainable 
warren's plan actually provides solution people facing liquidity problems it good excuse part then placed tax high enough paying dedicate manpower unique situations this different tens thousands find income just look made ton money bitcoin cashed incurring taxes put back lose bitcoin folk pretty messed never heard anyone use reason end 
why sell assets foreigners there's plenty people america 
maybe call payday loan place debt slavery works rest us 
and broke people financially steady 
warren's plan reduce net worth the tax high enough stop growth slow speed 
it every dollar billion think conceptually similar there big chance increasing rate bracket point would make harder pass since tax potentially nullify asset growth personally particularly care people seeing wealth mil logistically important 
this bernie's plan he decided copy warren make harsher fits brand 
no if wealth tax larger reasonable expectation profit investing younger wealthy people flee the reason warren caps based rate return like zuckerberg remain us citizens exit would still smaller annual sanders policy created make understand taxes finance feel good compared practically reduce economic inequality 
which countries wealth taxes gotten rid they expensive administrate easy make loopholes 
extremely violent bloody revolution plutocracy point next years 
who cares point view it depends audience if persuade people makes sense care think point's cheer lead matter 
the argument hoarded wealth bezos founded company owns significant portion people decided minuscule fractions worth apiece that's he literally created something value whether fairly another discussion 
it's two things would give us healthy stable economy everyone 
i've watched debates ya know recall turning broke people financially stable really coming taxing wealthy definitely where's stabilizing part 
this think funny billionaire would cry taxed still going billionaires 
good like politicians take notes politician's ideas especially warren why would bad thing 
not sure that's productive say mate are implying bernie running platform harsh punitive because pretty much complete opposite anything he's put date 
he polling leg bernie's plan 
student loan forgiveness healthcare premiums copays deductibles tuition free college universal childcare paid family leave raising minimum wage lowering housing costs 
warren quite lot minutes worth ideas the debates never good venue learn policy second bursts warrenplanbot show plans 
student loan forgiveness healthcare premiums copays deductibles tuition free college universal childcare paid family leave raising minimum wage lowering housing costs 
this assumes healthy economy allows grow wealth per year while true past years always case difficult main driver taken away it would like allowed work hours week 
agree though it'd nice see lose wealth sad warren go far enough 
it bad thing we trying vote best possible implementation ideas warren way better tax proposals bernie beefed plans 
bernie billionaires that's brand warren beef sorry disagree interpret way billionaires

yeah make feel sad billionaires 
any wealthy person complains taxed 
yeah translate harsh didn't know caring americans disliking top exploited rest bad thing mean jeez billionaires something 
ya pay plan but something important keep mind wont supreme ruler wins though senate trial shaping can't pass legislation exactly wants so matter exact numbers campaigns change go congress hoping put enough pressure local representatives force along warren still make changes plans 
listening shit since know want they children ignored 
work disability kids also medicaid the point taxes go ultra wealthy get redistributed programs help stabilize life health economic mobility everyday people for example finally starting new job soon contractor temp hire situation my increased income good thing but likely lose benefits and since eligible employer need switch plan marketplace experience suck compared warren healthcare could travel regardless employment status that would godsend ability back college trade school tuition totally open door change career paths thus bring home benjamins 
anti corruption make government start working instead serving ever slimmer margin top environmental we live planet might want consider taking better care societal you may benefit plans childcare health education but society rely goods services produced people reduced poverty increased help far actively use receive benefits already almost done master's degree work healthcare take kids etc engineer gets graduate opportunity warren's plan go build invent maybe make new toy love device cures ailment know currently hell maybe get decent job fall substance abuse never mugs car jacks taken commit many crimes anything interest 
freedom speech prohibits and tried already https www nytimes com us politics irs targeting tea party liberals democrats html 
know if support billionaires losing wealth bernie's option warrens plan slow growth rate tax reduces net worth 
it sounds like favor 'harsher' taxes billionaires do 'softer' idk think define harsher differently or maybe adding subtext comment see 
totally agree my fear whenever makes compromise though never warren peeps use evidence liar snake blah no matter wins need someone make deals negotiate moderates senate feel like best equipped bernie 
i'm talking billionaires rest voting public if message we're even going listen everyone involved come across well thought policy billionaires greedy answer question value private island 
is candidate making government start working us part platform or notably different climate change anyone else on education i'm bit hazy policy regards private universities so one things got interested warren years ago student loan interest rates there's reason federal profit loans wealth redistribution recent graduates bonkers at time research director ngo big focus use debt financed tuition dollars fund scholarships basically transferring money least privileged students naturally take attention anyways though talks free public university think great entirely clear her page mentions higher kinds accessible if able wipe happens next cohort going 
yeah aware did think serious fuck billionaires especially whiny ones 
support though voting bernie primary 
it's framing argument yes bernie favors higher taxes billionaires he needs order pay ambitious progressive plans but notice said instead harsher one sounds neutral twists context implying punitive person wants people fair share if used logic could easily say warren soft tax rates high bernie's there's reason lately nobody appear like french revolutionary guillotining rich saying sanders harsh brand really help 
the way get moderates support policies benefit working class choice preserve career in order win fights worth fighting tuition free college student debt relief stopping endless wars etc need build power among people force politicians move toward position replace someone there decades evidence proves can't debate befriend right thing money coming large corporations if think needs big structural change going achieved grand bargain conservatives it's using strategy fdr rally fight like hell make lot enemies either crush bend 
yeah no thread ever brought this billionaires why hard 
is candidate making government start working us part platform like talking candidates stay pretty broad some think deeper problem politics others want focus going back better times they less likely pass legislation make lasting changes warren specific concrete plans improve work people people say whatever campaign trail actionable plan prove actually given real thought notably different climate change anyone else jay inslee best policy running when dropped met got share she incorporates expands inslee's if able wipe student loan debt happens next cohort students private universities wiping nothing fix system made agree as specifically https elizabethwarren com affordable higher education but gets congress things governmental body writes new laws passes push advice ultimately changed passed her closest get so take look see feel 
context implying bernie punitive person wants people pay fair share you see differently that's fine one would expect things support different candidates think towards billionaires said debates trust talks that quote debate asking warren she started answering referenced cut saying do and ok agree supporter but problem thinks exist in event good luck while may disagree particulars goals 
like talking candidates don't let anyone else hear say might get banned reddit breaking rule demonize disagree on strengthening democracy think heart's right place i'm sure call plan actionable involves passing two constitutional amendments one polarized political climates ever environment seems main difference among dems nuclear power warren priority carbon emissions categorically ruling runs counter for education link provided specific thing looking said figure stance private universities she talks wiping existing student loans what's millions students enroll loan forgiveness 
on strengthening democracy think heart's right place i'm sure call plan actionable involves passing two constitutional amendments one polarized political climates ever that beauty warren many others she plans inside can't pass that's even bit legislation failed get democratic senators mcconnell litterally let single bill exclusivly executive branch if can't anything can something environment seems like main difference among dems nuclear power disagree priority carbon emissions categorically ruling runs counter agree going incredibly necessary but relent subject left using less america pro president supposed passed congress largely controlled group want zero climate regulations passing best possible important thing because paper exactly valuable worst worthless for education link provided specific looking said figure stance private universities based reading distinguish public says free year tech trade school the exact implementation decided put my expectation universities ability apply become fully funded federal government quality cost standards not every university everyone access university arguing easy quite contrary this difficult not years firmly believe us world far better presidency whatever given candidates 
how debates scheduled warren think very beneficial the first debate night lot people wanted check she control stage whenever spoke primarily half if anyone stopped watching next bernie could team moderates largely laughing stocks also differentiate now gonna center right next to biden flanking go biden alone shine i'm excited things come 
can't wait warren sanders bounce ideas back forth biden's standing thinking he's going work republicans 
she'll standing right biden she'll attack left 
kinda like biden sandwiched warren sanders also hate bashing goes sandersforpresident i'm sure minority saw someone say they're never even nomination like prefers respect understand supporter also refuse vote general 
amazing yang closer center beto haha love 
think moment breaks biden's lead initially predicted would probably get nomination name recognition biden one candidate could slip polls spotlight makes many missteps being situated middle warren sanders two sharpest candidates really highlight deficiencies also kills debates believe she'll difficult road securing pretty stable 
really hope bernie warren continue wreck candidates making stronger let build see cards fall end 
yeah actually beat trump jk any vote like best chance polls bullshit 
the debate stage alwaya existed 
can't wait another debate scratches surface shallow end 
i'm sad gillibrand overall glad debates finally narrowed candidates all also rans sucking oxygen 
beto fan warren close second this positioning really favorable the narrative shutting bernie already positioned biden's biggest threat with kind momentum feels like started chip away establishment support good luck everyone 
i'm another bernie warren smackdown 
look who's missing tulsi gabbard 
media needs stop pushing biden cnn totally stanning 
really like every media outlet pushing warren vs biden narrative wwe wrestling event 
the media bernie dirty hey least warren benefitting someone like buttigieg harris 
if beto booker swapped poc would one side 
this precisely dislike debates they're honest discussion benefits detriments policy they're ordeal see hold shouting match the position candidate standing matter unfortunately 
i'm excited bit worried well gonna lie she's like one whose polls rising think lot people going put spot 
but son would died without obamacare while failing point beau biden ag delaware got sick 
it best game tennis since wimbledon 
true stage right pov left 
originally gonna little harsher want bring negativity gotta say justice dems bernie bust diehards purity tests really get luxury living deep blue state dem always elected consider social democrat green new deal hill i'm willing die stan aoc but turn moderates whenever general even disagreements politics means messy coalitions and i'll continue pressure take good positions they're office that's make less progressive until actually y'know win elections midwest keep opinions who's selling 
the people bernie bust way includes warren sorts folks who'd either voting psl party socialism liberation candidate sanders ran it's like vote constitution ted cruz nominee 
also hate warren bashing goes sandersforpresident i'm sure minority saw someone say they're never even nomination as long vocal prevalent willing let shit slide but keeps popping bet that's russia trying divide electorate they mueller testified still actively meddling if worked work sanders supporter understand hillary people heard instigated movement sure could see stance become vehemently option trump seemed unconscionable yet look happened really messed people's heads 
some never move away bernie bust mindset those people matter age children 
there many bernie supporters liz enthusiastic candidate unfortunately ranked choice score star useful voting system primary guess technically mean anything last place but could sure important ends brokered convention moderates progressives one would delighted vote warren she number enormous gap tower competition 
yeah really frustrating trying hard make warren seem like hillary reality bernie team it ridiculous 
that sub toxic has since around december january 
post right warren hit piece funny said would never go hard everybody else 
the vast majority sanders supporters also like warren he attract wackier independents though our voting system always comes battle dumbest minds society propaganda powerful 
seen ridiculous happening it made sense people vote hillary warren wins bernie pick happy support moves 
agree also hate senile bernie bashing goes well wish people polarizing primary would fuck 
that subreddit incredibly disappointing its moderators deleting well reasoned opinions defense warren labeling conspiracy theories containing information widely believed true of course dnc pushed campaign steal support bernie republican sleeper agent never get deleted 
i'm behind sanders warren would thrilled able vote either general say see anti stuff top comment threads sanders' sub suspect camps leveraged create chasm two supporters groups gap need exist both progressives fighting correct problems created current administration 
also hate warren bashing goes sandersforpresident do favor stay away sub it's really toxic community almost bad donald bernie supporter unsubscribed week 
bernie supporter enthusiastically canvas votebank vote warren gets nomination candidate many us actually wanted on busters agree get little intense think huge silent never contingent seen online lots upper middle class coastal hillary folks still want blame shock loss suffered it visible would polls iirc so sometimes extremely reactionary responses ideologically rhetorically similar like getting better mainstream coverage feel lots people vested interests anything takes avoid even take closest political bedfellow hence circles hopefully focus consolidating power progressives eventually rally behind one two tbh extend biden general guess gotta individual bit ensure primary beefing cause irreparable divisions 
you mean grid but people 
he's one higher tier candidates since he's recently polling around level pete early primary states consistently beto 
sucks beto though solid th place til week 
polls bullshit general election polls early race primary ok understand like snapshot prediction put much faith one particular poll 
polls bullshit no let's support science makes us feel good anti statistics valid relevant extremely useful branch mathematics phds spend years developing skills gather interpret empirical data don't dismiss some many fact quite accurate reliable 
agree main point reasoning it stupid try vote based electability static thing electorate changes much every election able analyze except hindsight trump seen unelectable candidate decades ever oops 
i'm sure biden so far probably warren bernie 
um err tbh donnie pretty interesting job beating past couple weeks insert image germanic style clock bird pops set intervals on positive note rests finger surprised warren upward onward got one fans rallies ago smile every time see 
beto fan warren close second can ask couple questions totally genuine meant attack without offended why still do think able recover low single digit polls candidates polling and kind cross policies elizabeth see center dem party left though could wrong 
tom steyer higher chance meeting polling requirements support 
look who's missing tulsi gabbard she's she qualify debate low polling dnc approved polls 
actually mentioned candidate news last week https fivethirtyeight com features democratic presidential last sen bernie sanders online according data media cloud mediacloud org fn database stories percent democratic hopeful percentage points prior some coverage focused series proposals released topics ranging combating climate change www nytimes bernie sanders html supporting labor unions vox policy politics union plan worker rights reforming criminal justice system reform mass incarceration for example also included word and biden definitely getting disproportional amount cable difference warren's cable huge gap warren past 
can subreddit please it super unproductive hurts people perception sanders 
trump rnc raised million last quarter the democrat fixing broken campaign finance system needs priority number one office order anything need actually win election 
has candidate specifically pledged certain kinds fundraising general 
the rules she knew needed get done simple 
agreed debates terrible way evaluate candidates anything measure actual qualities would take good effective president the modern debates even worse they turned sporting events reward highlight conflict rather showcasing talent party best thing say viewed lot people provide opportunity less engaged learn little political junkie still organize life around wish bit useful 
hear performance aspect presidency also important you need able convince hundreds millions people want commanding presence wish presidents tested aspects president like ability understand complex topics explain policy solutions feel make main stage winnowing candidates basic facts math that would weed many charlatans 
used feel way saw something twitter changed mind the presidency grueling job intense focus required hours agree shouting match aspect crap requiring hold together keep cool multi hour policy discussion pretty important test presidential hopeful's qualifications 
she handle i'm worried lot things handles pressure one 
that's exactly want become president 
wondering happen asked taking corporate money general election seems like tricky subject 
that's great let's make even better 
busting anyone naive painfully privileged stance to could possibly excused inexperience last four years evidence harm causes point simply abhorrent 
said single candidate announced run voting wining dem needs russian troll bot litmus test would elect ebola virus trump 
iono would russia divide left their goal historically america always destroy center destroying helps occam's razor man sanders lot offer bros staff serious toxicity problem like said instigated found smooth landing really messed people's heads 
lately warren going accept pac money general corrupt controlled dnc wall street as entire campaign eliminating corruption already dozens different policies holding accountable government fighting corporations years essentially create cfpb 
if wanna really lose check wayofthebern 
that's get i'm leaning towards sanders primary love warren presidency gets excited just couple small things but neither enemies our biggest move destroying biden kamala moderates 
i'm local warren volunteer community i've never seen single anti bernie post this reason picked time absolutely favorite part supporting compared really loved communities 
do favour never watch rising 
it incomprehensible if like bernie positions huge leap support warren nom know nov voting blue no matter who of course hope liz happy remaining candidates save old joe but refusing vote fascist orange shitstain option 
years trump irreversible catastrophic climate change would set stone may well end us least still values 
if warren pulls ahead sanders drop endorse and campaign issues candidate personalities want biden nominee to clear i'll vote gets nomination something happen drops support but sincerity magnetism winner best qualified job 
theyre also people insist nobody actually bernie bust 
rest bernie crowd straight refuses admit responsibility brush saying crazies troll go parrot trolls 
think honestly minor thing representative either camps wary remembering last time probably good overall 
same active literally first post ever come shitting online sanders supporters not giving faith people preaching tbh 
likewise banned sandersforpresident primary suggesting clinton would make better president trump 
unless summons miracle beto pulling debate imo he one 
yang polling like every early state while pete much better ia maybe little nh nationally done pretty well last national polls debate positions based inched ahead beto 
not quite wish case polling around percent absolute best nationally late pete bit higher this technically put th closer booker beto 
general election poll months completely useless 
agree people trot polls general election match ups even mention got horribly wrong sure poll says candidate likely win there's chance they'll loose given systematically i'd think journalists citing would want least attempt assure readers new factoring whatever factors missed last time around there lots ways different others say together added depressed enthusiasm one surely seems like something could measured accounted anyway reason healthy skepticism especially they're total bullshit 
ok ever participated poll would ive never asked it small sample size completely random used sway people nothing science idk talking soft maybe polls chemistry lol denying climate change simply saying represent anything they know data comes polled 
well leading great omnipotent polls who people polling met anyone ever participated poll 
beto personal hero mine his campaign home state texas really struck chord believe leadership skills great president then el paso happened way conducted contrast trump cemented stand he obviously hill battle several months first caucus happens think things break right starts resonate debates interviews could make serious comeback would bet money no do he'll win iowa nh but loooooooong go also acknowledge warren contrasting policies although made evident since dem primary however trying get place yes medicare america end day want high quality public insurance everyone they may different supports fight raising minimum wage living woman's choose tackling climate change net zero carbon emissions ending reckless trade wars etc find caught half liberal progressive lots candidates' platforms appeal would thrilled vote either one the reddit lot people optimistic well love engage guys swing feel inclined learn platform 
warren impeachment 'every single person congress called vote' 
we've impeachment vote recently brought al green we know stand democrats voted those folks need primaried 
ok say congress goes record republicans shamed like soul point and get the senate rejecting impeachment procedures trump using win fuel candidacy idk liz thinking pelosi one 
respect liz much it's terrible dems spineless pursue impeachment 
at least need know opposed measure 
to fair articles without investigation include obstruction charges racist remarks judge voted specific bill even opening formal 
i'm starting impeachment hearings jumping straight week mueller hearing would insane like exactly people think happened every democrat voted yes for lot country paying much attention blue looked tune even it rightly idea need primaried top counterproductive getting control government frankly sounds like sort dem infighting agitation russian psyops in incredibly important election want spend ton resources political capital trying remove half democratic delegation vote ill timed poorly constructed that sure republican operative's wet dream 
live wa representative suzan delbene voted impeachment her predecessor governor presidential candidate jay inslee spoken favor wonder would still rep 
no spread hate discord specifically works shared goals there many reasons one might vote impeachment specific grounds many wanted wait muller finishes testimony others want interview conclusion different investigation some think better control narrative current state rather impeached earlier however agree it time delays excuses 
exactly let's burn whole democratic party that show republicans 
how sure election free foreign influence i'm willing bet 
because pelosi worried doom moderate dems lose many newly gained seats democrats red districts likely vote impeach convinces middle party give cover tabling 
because impeachment would lead nowhere without chance senate vote convict impeaching trump nothing political theater that likely play democrats' favor 
judge voted specific bill agree sentiment way right if last time house gets vote impeachment may case i'm judging based primaries another politician votes continue matter willing let previous go 
frankly think al green's resolution likely last time house get vote impeachment voted yes knew mueller finished yesterday go week vacation then it'll close election so reps that's permanent mark if there's later one sort erases the fact dems start hearings jan since green force 
however agree it time impeachment no delays excuses everything wrote contradicted correct statement 
those reps democrats primary replace people 
impeachment work understand needs something like rds how may republicans vote impeach none talking anyone else ps expert 
democrats red districts likely lose vote impeach that's assumption think wrong part 
and makes perfect sense no point losing house remove trump 
it's right move impeachment might run election time dems trying gain voters such action make people dig rally harder otherwise now lose all hands deck impeachment 
benghazi email investigations political theater republicans faced zero consequences 
why would play dems favor are basing clinton impeachment 
you could right close election whole point make sure impeachment stuff forgotten time comes around 
see contradiction it feels like specifically trying divide democratic base why all weaken ability actually thing want you advocate removing hundred democrats office think impeaching trump solely racism good idea he done so much racist hobble entire impeachment proceedings forcing narrow time impeach many offences picking egregious least defendable crimes probably including 
clearly adam schiff republican disguise good grief 
think mean replace republicans it interesting strategy putin mcconnell would support i'm sure 
you absolutely right however house even investigative powers mueller could actually make shit public we months left never 
this terrible strategy impeach damn consequences 
trump win vote the last two elections compromised god's name people acting like next one 
pursuing impeachment avenue definitely result conviction label dems lame ducks anything directly help american people

oh pretend understand mind gop voting base but tow line say climate change get primaried that tea party go tool closing ranks pushing politics right admittedly certain democrats started flirt recently scale the primary bite mechanism accountability democratic party 
lived america abortions illegal if means still access safe it marginalized vulnerable people we never go back time elizabeth warren 
really happy warren saying bluntly thank 
while appreciate declaration already halfway back time ridiculous regulations clinic closures lack coverage insurance made abortions prohibitively expensive many especially travel overnight stay may involved 
elizabeth campaign gotten much better using non gendered language comes reproductive rights seriously means the switch simple feel like lot people notice tell making concerted effort it's something wrote several times whether part seen heard 
this people get republicans want outlaw abortion anyone wealthy rich white powerful anytime mistress gets knocked need unfortunately nearly empathy comes democrats everyone rights accessible special exceptions damn wonder think republicans 
one point feel need make republicans really pro life would arms fertilized eggs get killed ivf clinics wouldn line christian values mandated embryos gestated artificial wombs but course pay who take care babies fully developed republicans stupid know push costs means someone responsible lives better responsibility women this exactly hate abortion support food stamps government programs like idea actually caring expensive time cost onto low income afford 
personally like abortions pro choice sensible policy general populace 
liz warren republican abortion illegal 
roe wade probably make end scotus season 
this good hear entering healthcare specifically reproductive care try use word like pregnant people uterus it easy switch hope validating comforting future patients 
eli important is transgendered folk figured reproductive rights ultimately women issue 
it abortions decent healthcare good paying jobs tax benefits etc all society geared towards improving life rich 
convinced anti abortionists care fetus they motivated prejudices women abortions think murderers want sex without responsibility if loved ones need obviously fine this always responsible doubt many would furious babysitters one example demonstrates say things believe vilifying people extreme form prejudice also consistent view birth controls many simultaneously oppose control their reason opposing interestingly abstinence in proposing expose concern still of course ok using research found highly prejudiced wide ranging researcher calls equal opportunity bigots explains supportive party locks children cage discriminatory policies mind criminals lazy undesired etc even policy targets love others support by time realize hurt already late self righteous thinks having said emphasize general malicious politicians hand due ignorance remarkable capacity change get know different lack empathy loving everyone else 
bet go ivf clinics they even went women get pregnant due rapes incest people point inconsistency pro life exceptions to around cost simply outlaw restrict fertilized eggs must implanted preserved doctors clients would prosecuted 
totally agree the government try avoid mandating medical procedures like pregnancy birth moral reasons really dislike abortions government baning even for people us best policy better education anti poverty measures people abortion plan so tackle problems lead

ineffectiveness fundamental right privacy good reasons legalize abortion opposing majority ban something religious always bad idea nothing americans think acceptable ever carry criminal penalty zero exceptions statement criminal law exists punish rectify anti society behavior if approves kind thing criminally illegal 
sure while ideological makeup court changed still supposed impartial body jurists it would significant move upend principle stare decisis overturn roe 
this blue matter who general good handful bernie bust people seem forgetting trump gets one republican supreme court game no climate change action next generation 
scotus reasonably needs overturn griswold connecticut happen think going close vote simply doubt ballsy enough reverse constitutional right to privacy precedents across board fun fact though odds pretty good decision reverses roe automatically obergefell gay marriage world hurt us they're based precedent 
heya it's important trans non binary folx reproductive rights limited women's issue one woman uterus person still affected repro decisions many men well using gendered language anyway erasing supporters may identify man saying people instead women acknowledges existence good practice 
removed per rules please promote candidates divide democratic party 
convinced anti abortionists care fetus i'm sure individual pro life activists i've known lot grew catholic school but politically pro never they know abortion restrictions us likely make abortions unsafe go away planned parenthood led march education reduced pre roe levels bans always less effective facts politicians want remove right privacy give free passes contraceptives gay marriage punish sinners overturning griswold lets 
just everyone like mean people hypocrites also much wanna bet evangelical christians would still vote republican made mistress abortion fyi raised christian ny specifically li nyc know well bubbles prefer secular california whatever hell want legally without morality police jumping back 
and we're brutally honest like republicans want lose boogeyman roe fundraising evangelical areas 
all happen shift question right privacy unborn human persons rights once granted severe restrictions legal abortion 
yea understand people could short sided point vote one candidate period like bernie fan warren would hell consolation price end nominee even biden though certainly ideal miles better trump 
fun story already cancer pull bullshit warren candidate simply commenting support sanders so they affirming pronouns incredibly important matters please ugly 
exactly needed know thank sorry young homophobe transphobe general bigot around lot learning catch align progressives past years lol 
disagree in general anti abortion voters like described they ignorance based prejudices fears self righteousness think moral indeed far righteous even though standards sin much average people word high sense superiority super politicians malice manipulative power hungry yes speak supporters language votes 
in many red states bet would go like abortion clinics rapes incest victims blue think state level since enough political power federal mistake understand republican party politicians pro rich they friends donors always find ways give get jail cards even violates laws doubt need though oversea abortions available us pay people carry pregnancies raise babies 
wow that's good point never thought if row overturned abortion becomes illegal rile base but suppose would become vote us keep saving babies 
an excellent point overturning roe wade puts defensive gives left opportunity attack plus might actually wake passive white female voters 
here's problem mindset they already lost pro life battle know if roe overturned states still keep abortion legal and there's significant defensible constitutional challenges leaving state get elsewhere felony since types laws simply seem viable nothing change movement except extra vigor manage end fundamental right privacy there always boogeyman it'll one election away because we'll never amendment bans in unlikely event federal ban repealed day one automatic blanket pardons every time democrats majority house senate only side actually win war ever choice so life needs stay relevant quit 
granting fetus rights person creates whole host bioethical legal problems jurisdictions tried found 
absolutely glad hear catching it often uncomfortable process begin question come terms views previously held hurt people feel like lot sometimes keep 
perhaps view painted live traditionally blue area watched lot people involved pro life marches they want democrats start losing wanted pro march prejudice poor i'm sure share self righteousness actual nuns leading honestly believing could make difference realize pawns but politically different when look leaders spent serious time know stakes odds they're never going stop abortions agenda involves punishing sinners certain type sin frankly planning abortion the they're really fighting overturn fundamental right privacy typical voter beyond couple technicalities post opening disagree think we're page 
pro life understand well the cruelty point in ga black women die birth rate white working make restrictive laws people may believe politicians know get abortions 
yeah would keep voting us installing judges make sure new roe whatever come practice 
even current attempts appear enough get certain amount white women asses voting along black generally formed one bulwarks anti choice laws 
granting fetus rights person creates whole host bioethical legal problems jurisdictions tried found negro southern apologist told weeks ago slavery like holding wolf ears it good idea situation can't let go feel apologists lot common pro choice movement today they look caused recognizing humanity unborn overlook important issue there human life worthy value made commodity whose determined entirely much another wants yes scene becomes difficult recognize inherent excuse deny anyone 
see mean for voters think talking two different groups people evangelicals form core base republican party they sources power anti abortion politicians evangelical pastors plan stop abortions this motivate and real origin oppositions mass either the highly opposed laws prohibit running segregated schools remaining tax exempt if interested provide back claims 
think agreement one thing learned many anti abortion voters driven compassion toward fetus prejudices said cruelty point there two sides coin on one side harsh prejudiced targets adore people they make sort justifications rationalizations loved ones leaders etc trump abortions want abandon 
one biggest frustrations living suburbia white women actively vote self interest roll whatever hubby wants in house open discussion candidates issues small person block i've come across many passive maybe years trump they'll wake get involved least informed 
there two dimensions abortion debate dimension one at point sex cells become person few call woman's period abortion unfertilized egg fewer still sperm never make death the first instance earliest heard people try claim hood but half zygotes actually implant lost that awful lot humans dying pretty standard system you get stuck outlawing fertilization clinics attempt multiple hopes takes this view also leaves room allowing abort raped family so mandates year old girls hold child term father it forces risk lives pregnancy progressing unhealthy way may lead mother difficult zygote impossible second what government force order save another person's life pregnancy dangerous expensive time consuming alive if required medical procedures mandated state people need kidneys livers can mandate donate organs bone marrow even easier leads curing diseases cured or smallest procedure saves hundreds thousands holds almost zero donor blood donation should mandatory well penalties breaking law treated like murder would missing many donation appointments put away my take fully agree idea bad really persons ability decide allowed avoid something think needs very compelling reason legalize able largely unnecessary education childcare anti poverty measures warren best policies things

see there's simply evangelical presence around the pro life dangerous voting blue matter starting get shakier other vote manipulation think catholics one biggest risks country blue balance agree sources know talking truth angle i've seen and people forget non politically started getting very political side newer 
unfortunately opposite true relative mine she's getting conservative last couple years people information around sad see sliding away low voter single issue unfortunately abortion rights 
if required hold child term medical procedures mandated state ethically big difference prohibiting someone something compelling action here asking enforce prohibition murder not allowing requiring the arguments pregnancy death less potent ever longer common result reasonable expectation would country support laws taken intended saving mom's life even catholic church recognizes much ectopic pregnancies procedure never kill unhappy byproduct save woman's think legalize abortion but may able make largely unnecessary education childcare anti poverty measures yes providing better resources certainly help also need culture change we put focus getting ahead so many women abortions it'll get way career college ambition valued families percent unwanted drop quite considerably men likely take responsibility happy carry baby

elizabeth supporting uaw strike solidarity sunday 
wish stayed little longer given offical speech understand busy felt bad since everyone swarming around lol 
liz looks like much fun every day 
but heard corporatist she must bust unions 
this strike kind makes feel bad owning gm car 
that's really strong kara swisher vibe right 
yeah the crowd great it really crazy see people swarming like 
going clyburn's wife emily funeral understandable 
man imagine biden thing despite typically pretty pro union 
don buying union made products services best way help labor movement two huge reasons first means good paying jobs plain simple you certainly gm workers purchasing foreign owned non cars reduces demand results layoffs second successful company easier unions share success get wrong negotiated contracts boom bust times employer never gives raises benefits generosity but tough simply money that strike the saved giving lot today making tons want give back things gave save first place so keep buying unless calls upon people boycott in case make damn sure buy boycotted product dispute resolved source former organizer current activist 
that's necessary friend if gm car likely made union members don't feel bad continue support labor rights

from recollection basically responding quote article you someone like elizabeth warren thinks right answer break companies gets elected president would bet legal challenge win and still suck us yeah mean want major lawsuit government but look end day going try threaten something existential go mat fight 
don't call democrats names this war people inside party some groups may never enthusiastic warren they're still allies bigger fight 
shocked learn facebook burying content politicians like on hand big shift away users exposed organic companies organizations order push pay advertising in could reliably produce good show fb today almost entirely play

that need people an automated algorithm keeps anything name page requires oversight could designed generally promote suppress content they needed create one manipulate feeds openly talk only person needs add setting warren zuck this facebook anymore 
also warren's two billionaire donors wives businessman heir husbands donate maybe maybe rich women like lots would support woman viable chance becoming president 
thought hilarious delete facebook movement took often would see people saying done moving instagram this exactly problem as soon social media starts take business buys anti competitive laws designed stop avoids makes money via ads instead directly charging consumers we desperately need change break companies like 
only social media use even much reddit 
uh mean originally laughing realize response context along text story described headline if former know

elizabeth warren presidential candidate earn new indivisible scorecard 
day one democracy agenda senator elizabeth warren received top score section proposed set transformative structural reforms democracy would put power back hands americans those include support dc statehood court reform addition campaign finance voting rights anti corruption sen also firmly committed making agenda legislative priority elected supports eliminating filibuster order enact progressive vision well indivisible certainly see eye 
this great warren may lost fair weather fans fall strong support engaged active democrats progressives significant imo 
here https docs google com document me ixzegwv usttj lsmaupkghgsdy xfeirlba edit specific rubric detailed explanations methodology anyone interested like say impressed well fleshed 
warren getting top marks scorecard studied just want keep saying studious scholarly vibe everything 
warren coming straight vibe surprised 
tf give sanders low score 'building grassroots power' 
can someone explain scorecard represents 
yep this probably biggest reason i'm supporting warren if can't fix electoral system think reforms country urgently needs last 
and support despite progressive economic issues 
bernie sanders grassroots candidate entire history humans 
right yang said opposite trump asian likes math i'd suggest actually woman knows talking 
senator sanders lost points part scorecard he endorsed one progressive congressional primary challenger far cycle declined participate indivisible candidate interview process citing scheduling conflicts 
ok well first score low second explained senator sanders lost points part scorecard he endorsed one progressive congressional primary challenger far cycle declined participate indivisible candidate interview process citing scheduling conflicts third talking anyway instead warren she got category received top section investing grassroots activism exciting new ways although scores reflect adopt particular position sen also led field making commitments center rejecting super pacs exclusive high dollar fundraisers committing appoint donors positions power support movement organizations and supporting ballot candidates like marie newman jessica cisneros demonstrating real political courage fighting make democratic party inclusive force government 
my question many sandernistas warren subreddit 
this reason prefer warren sanders we can't afford waste time political capital even urgent social reforms we've secured election system fixed broken democracy because things immediately we'll probably lose senate white house kiss idea free fair elections goodbye 
part initially liked buttigieg scotus reform proposals 
my top reason well she seems get moment we're 
bernie plan warren hastag amendmentking 
the opposite trump would smart morally courageous woman relevant job experience 
bias disclosure bernie first pick warren second it certainly good look list busy come interview one reasons got lower score also see endorsing people indicator grassroots support especially endorsed individual donor count as matter even non progressives try use angle take that could flaw way determine sander movement entire thing discounted their follow disingenuous insinuations establishment candidates real edit yes downvoting super helpful definitely positive impact polls 
some can't see anything positive another candidate without seeing negative 
i'm since joined decided back bernie warren i'd still happy nominee apologize supporters complain 
because lot think go subs convince supporters move bernie 
they run negative campaign i'm sure board look like cares try curb everything rigged everyone else evil well thought recruitment tactics gaining allies friends 
because warren popular nd choice sanders supporters many support candidates 
can't speak personal army clones i'm one person think fair dismiss warren first choice 
think strong case win presidency believe sanders fight corruption money politics warren effective general though 
ugh let anti american hashtag floating nomonarchs 
bro talking bernie leader campaign reform candidate never taken big dollar donations https berniesanders com issues free fair elections supporting warren mean spreading misinformation fellow progressive plus advocating entire yr political career one pressing country issue voters interested people die year bc lack insurance defend position grifters like pete every single debate 
also see endorsing people indicator grassroots support especially look endorsed individual donor count disagree downballots extremely important presidential candidates for one bernie dem nominee going get anything done without congress work endorsing downballots strengthen movements locally nationally anyway still got really good score supporters use make already great movement even better 
also see endorsing people indicator grassroots support you're making assumption that's category supposed measuring they're looking broader power beyond individual campaign building grassroots power indivisibles know national change come one leader take movement want candidate committed building demonstrated fundraising strategy management progressive candidates engagement indivisible groups 
their follow disingenuous insinuations establishment candidates real grassroots support except none scored well category like actually read scorecards somewhere bernie get top spot came tell us wrong as matter even warren first pick non progressives try use angle take first would the people concerns complaining st place use push candidate better instead trying discredit show want 
obviously not sure another candidate performing bernie means scorecard questionable instead commending well 
then talk sanders sub just built good campaign mean owns rights grassroots one further indivisible lays exactly parameters actually explain scored people see questionable they've explained falls slightly shorter we're talking pt difference first place 
there's problem liking bernie well warren the people start tearing build bloody subreddit 
yeah seem lot unfortunately noticed also kamala harris sub dropped 
that possible the people trying seem understand though you also need thick skin adults honest disagreements must recognize politicians weak points fair criticisms well seems hardest pill sanders crowd swallow like many think electing year old heart attack extremely stressful important job bad idea walk away politely point going talk good matter say 
we trying dismiss preferring bernie liz it people come try drive blackout rigged tf better like ok entitled believe overtly judge need specific thread sub 
think fair dismiss arguing higher score bernie article clearly explains lower 
that makes sad butterflies how nomonarchy 
not sure another candidate performing bernie means scorecard questionable instead commending well when area building grassroots power yeah make 
disagree sentiment there plenty people fans warren sanders able reasonable discussion 
say anything like things quoting examples bad conduct asked question bernie know sub clearly we're interested fair well contested primary right 
think being able build grassroots power extremely important that's way anything actually get done it's obviously also going really organization 
please see comment thread https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments deg elizabeth warren presidential fahnmvb utm source share medium web it'd questionable say bernie th place buttigieg st refused disclose grading rubric but warren long history grassroots organizing standards indivisible clearly outlined linked right webpage i'm sure questioning 
they explain reasoning lost points aspect score makes sense it's still good bernie's part 
because clearly outperforming this pretty subjective based scorecard they laid parameters reasoning scores arbitrary it based polling higher specific moment can get actual discussion instead licking warren's toes repeat disingenuous no one elizabeth warren sub want circle jerk bernie the grassroots candidate else ever allowed compete different understand supporters ignore fact competitive movement she also endorsed progressive ballot candidates currently that's part like talking much 
but building new depth grass roots campaign better messaging notice discipline she support bash others like campaigns likely never absurd litmus test fielded undisciplined supporters think bully way pulpit 
that helps one else he pretty weak helping others get elected great system need congressmen minimum senators realistically days scotus justices say law constitutional make changes president 
million donations donors and give heads volunteers translates expanding base because gained back ground heart attack he's still polling well say would extremely happy bernie gets nomination he's far away second choice but i'm skeptical campaigning intention building upon current supporters essential getting majority delegates 
small dollar individual donors million you mean donations keep mind bernie already built name recognition infrastructure cycle ran warren's grassroots movement still competitive run president feel like tied the reason tie though warren supports ballot races moment if pushed endorse progressive candidates interview indivisible make possibly get category they said continue updating scores throughout primary take note push candidate rather hand wave away agree conclusions 
mean course conversations policy positions better people complaining different candidate's rating outside organization nothing warren warren's means terms getting votes it's digression think quibbling definitions grassroots point post 
yes think score bernie fair given reasons provided it's still really good supporters take opportunity improve already great grassroots movement maybe send tip campaign endorse downballot democratic progressive candidates 
care elizabeth warren bernie ranked score lower 
right but think fair say different good ways for example warren record gun control undoubtedly progressive bernie rely nra and healthcare also slightly edges liz really began supporting policy though fine lol neither takes away many fierce candidates especially since ideology extremely alike strongly people special interests obviously like why they great that said there places one article job explaining exact criteria scores explicitly notes literally points behind anyone sanders supporter come sub most welcomed align frustrating try pull us towards this specifically targeted way know sandernistas referring berners vast majority supported strong second choice even trolls screaming ranting og corporatist shill whatever 
standards indivisible clearly outlined it's great disclosed rubric automatically mean good 
think lot bernie stans believe nobody can better anything so someone says he's best obviously biased wrong honestly that's scariest thing movement supporters really creating echo chambers like needs address base 
what make good rubric which part disagree is something missing would like see factored 
mean also shows uninformed politicians obama huge grassroots movement and warren's record organizing goes back first ran senate from npr article https www npr org sections itsallpolitics elizabeth warren leaps primary challenge massachusetts win democratic party chair john walsh said warren would make massachusetts families proud boston herald reports elizabeth made history today strength impressive organization tireless advocate middle class throughout run http runwarrenrun plantowin website in accolades extraordinary prowess fundraiser raking big money contributions inspiring legions small donors get flood cash wall street done much hold banksters accountable jan sxsw schedule sxsw com events event iap description consumer harvard law professor built strongest digital program senate the campaign raised dollar online ever offline field knocked doors there's plenty simple google search 
he never address base design the call coming inside house 
he needs reel respond well dose reality this asked gets things passed without compromising starts chanting revolution something harassing agree the thing worked would already done you need president try tomorrow obviously fail house cards comes tumbling either compromise ideas water bit take stepping stone approach ease fears trade away huge republicans get anything warren pitched second option much reasonable sanders seems like likely bunch come empty hardline 
only acting like one they scored explained score lower chill 
want believe best bernie one major differences warren lots examples telling people things honestly see listening often puts plans gonna bring table clearly makes effort listen think better leader 
listen fan warren long time one favorite politicians strength corporations but wants win gonna need sanders progressives considering third want sanders president instead literally formed career fighting credit card companies biden used nicknamed senator mbna fought hard company donors made harder americans free debt so rejection hurts makes choose side attacks fellow champion movement saying bernie listen people baffling sounds like something cnn elitist panelist would say it energy progressive supporters different candidates claim republican thereby erases amazing activism they friends reason values align copy pasted examples going way give voice everyday think misconceptions pushed around reconstructing history centrist harmful voices reuniting veteran went rally given mic tell story coverage anymore disabled helped make sure case heard longer this video showing year kill help presenting airforce jacket https youtu sq dsxbg campaign giving media bangladeshi tenants trying form union fight abhorrent living conditions ydwmchwjnkg tear jerker perspective struggling immigrant single mom in traveled small town immokalee florida met migrants exploited farms hear stories brought back congress succeeded helping improve xxehzsakr highlight reel his public access show mayor walk whole city interview constituents ask questions conversations vyg zwn up host weekly friday townhall thomharman radio take callers country issues ti na overview vermont large qrfkpaknjyq and finally immigration reform proposal written staffers daca recipients cdeoajhzoew 
warren is on mission to take away moscow mitch's filibuster power win senate majority 
this thing democrats must senate candidates every race week ago democratic senate election committee sending warning enough republicans even contested would ensure gop hold onto majority the party needs ramp recruiting fast find grassroots among also rans currently running president decisive nothing change 
miracle win presidency seats senate keep house go fucking scorched earth salt fields want packed courts codified norms jailed corrupt politicians etc 
her support abolishing filibuster one reasons warren even democrats win house senate presidency place prevent passing platform there items use reconciliation process pass even would procedurally politically difficult if think good policy ideas awful result it could also create political disaster voters turn next year vote democratic president congress belief they'll enact agenda little gets passed many feel let stay home subsequent election cycles abolishing lead better politics 
we need senate majority state massachusetts needs make law governor appoints senator party already win somehow lose seat president it'd awkward fuck 
steps ensure democratic majority dc statehood puerto rico statehood if want vote split california three states 
totally unrelated thumbnail image post envision hell game ipad 
kentucky election primary registration deadline https vrsws sos ky gov ovrweb april vic may general october november 
she president would say mater right one vote senator 
guys get warren stand chance 
here's want us dilute scotus hard limit judge count also think would better democracy this way death match fight every time new nominee if like tough literally care 
we need seats senate get rid filibuster the reason republicans already gotten care legislation they judges tax cuts deregulation all achieved simple majority 
elizabeth women scorch earth do think joe would 
to late trump packed courts lmao scorched earth 
only months triggering special election 
puerto rico absolutely state instance legitimate referendum think even want say would solve everything lot problems they're happen infrastructure accountability statehood bring different animal the constitution established district columbia federal land at time ridiculous many people without congressional representation either chamber there's reason wyoming vermont bit problematic make though i'm torn maybe essentially absorbed maryland and respond last point splitting california states win influence senate terrible consider shatter precedent there's nothing stopping texas breaking 
sticking one nickname better keeps everybody exact page the nicknames get thrown less particular impact 
if read wrote see talking something would president she's attempting campaigning get members party win seats senate it's actually refreshing change usual i'm i'll legislative branch things 
she's consistently scoring crucial stretch campaign still think biden better shot ugh please warren stay top tier unlike mayor pete seems strong polling fizzle 
thanks opinion guy whose entire reddit history comments tweaker porn 
think chance win senate seat given republican governor massachusetts could appoint anyone want heard might wrong idk 
supreme court lottery https poseidon ssrn com delivery php id ext pdf 
what sub think made support biden 
warren could even resign senate president elect would trigger special election sooner 
true considering screwed every month counts 
we dream it kind possibility years ago also deal maryland dc suburbs form state they potomac believe 
all proposals statehood basically shrink district columbia blocks government buildings creating new state believe call washington douglass commonwealth house bill sessions still rest city agree splitting states 
texas believe state union actual right whereas even wy would never meet population minima and ca split unless knows water come probably involve renegotiating colorado river compact good luck 
well convince mcconnell oh democratic leadership go along neither and i'm still convinced good idea just imagine would like first two years trumps presidency without trump calls end filibuster https thehill com homenews administration trump mitch expect happen 
no even laying aside questionable best constitutionality majority lower courts drawing also stacked much crazier people less public outrage better answer jurisdiction stripping https overcast fm hg whxkoe 
it rhetorical question of course joe he would keep things urge us move 
we dream dream california breaking no thanks the people want nutjobs state jefferson north and say someone lives bay area 
fair enough guess looked proposal statehood surface level 
of course even considering feasibility move like splitting meant one state overcame others would look follow greater power federal government charge 
texas right congress gave permission any state would petition massachusetts virginia 
end filibuster lot nominations really meaningless like used prevent bunch bills coming floor mitch would otherwise love vote senate body outdated honestly better without 
met people palm springs area certainly the rich republicans want pay high taxes 
texas right congress gave permission yeah left give came back so agreement apply anymore 
really filibuster meaningless you naive 
ethics complaints stemming false rape allegations lmao dismissed perjury lmao 
understand people like if money love move somewhere low taxes of course places tend industries made rich first place stay 
it also explicitly says us texas split order maintain balance free slave states there's way possible much secessionists want 
texas leave legal sense the confederacy never recognized supreme court found none states declared secession right first place west virginia reabsorbed legislature restored government acted government exile whole despite representatives coming pro union trans allegheny counties granted permission kanawha become state massachusetts maine years earlier 
the filibuster harm good thankful republicans arent governing poor leadership general chaos thier side sunk bad bills it lost meaning overuse even hold floor anymore votes pass legislation sounds paper like status quo but point majority agree house president well those senators chance if problem take voters 
got sense money old likely getting rich somewhere else they want golf look rest world poor 
the filibuster harm good hard quantify would hard measure shit done needed majority like status quo not reason it counter balance quick changes law double edged sword now think need make near impossible yes medicare willing give restraint white christian nationalist may try next time power 
lmao christine ford well founded look liberals abused words like racism ethics point meaningless so liberal makes complaint literally anything looked the fact complaints dismissed enough proof absurd much impeaching trump impeach sitting justice neither happened claims lack reasonable foundation 
dear see source states ethics complaints indeed well founded or look complaint investigated comes conclusion suggesting what made prior becoming justice stop reading others opinions regurgitating facts word salad dismissed comment serious lower courts authority try sitting scotus judge please have an adult teach you how to form sentence non sequitur argument he got technicality 
elizabeth warren bloomberg 'i guess figured cheaper paying two cent wealth tax' 
good article read comment section the bots nutso republicans force fight wealth tax so talk face friends family warren sense america change better money power us tooth nail keep status quo 
here argument guys we got worked hard earned money this market economy warren said and answer you great idea hit big moment made good glad hear she continued but understand built fortune america guarantee least part using workers us helped pay educate all saying make mean really top th pitch two cents everybody else gets chance just think bears repeating 
this already posted politics comment section lacking warren fans you know remember link back sub help grow warren's online support would i'm banned give silver remind good folks candidate 
iowa election caucus voter pre registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january www aclu ia org en find caucus site february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
non supporter here's real sincere question bloomberg's net worth mostly tied assets even public equities companies private ownership bloomberg estate etc ltd company traded stocks market value according stock you want tax how calculate there's entire industry firms valuation work hard assign solid number find believe government fair effective method determining what like artwork cars boats furniture intellectual property can really idea who decides 
you've seen happened weinstein cosby these people physically mentally break they're stopped thing they've ever known there's lot things humans need survive we socialize eat water people like bloomberg trump biden politicians remain relevant it's mental illness almost 
guess figured cheaper paying two cent wealth tax first class comedic chops 
warren first choice i'll voting primary but try tear democratic candidates bloomberg miles better trump wins nomination need mad due infighting no 
that's threads always start warren believe pretty easy leave supportive comments politics usually accrue votes 
the best part vast majority make less yr would never actually impacted completely selfish view negative way 
dont think wealth tax work thats whynso many countries stopped using 
love explanation wealth tax think isnt quite high enough always tinker gets passed cents makes great messaging 
the valuation methods need figured detail that's expected propose entirely new type tax from warren's website https elizabethwarren com plans ultra millionaire emphasis mine irs already rules assess value many assets estate purposes ultra millionaire tax chance tighten existing close loopholes develop needed for example would authorized use cutting edge retrospective prospective formulaic certain harder like closely held business non owner occupied real 
what prompts bring weinstein cosby particular they're known sexual predators afaik bloomberg in case referring group two jewish one black american specifically people seems ill advised 
that's think mostly astroturfing because immediately anything positive warren shows there's million comments pocahontas calling liar but come later generally someone really hates everything try shape narrative artificially 
politics brigaded hard sanders' polling barely changed yet generally neutral even warren leaning getting slammed posts many comments they're pretty bland wayofthebern 
please explain mean think using phrase wealth tax describe policies wildly different size scope european taxes often started much lower threshold impacted working class families simultaneously exempting wide variety assets contributed they minimally punitive upper words name what elizabeth warren proposed dramatically sophisticated designed deter export countries assess capture associated etc these fiscal could frankly part eu makes enormous difference capital enters leaves country edit autocorrect 
move money citizenship tax havens 
maybe maybe at least moves conversation status quo works reduce real problems facing us due inequity 
that's right wing talking point other countries can't tax expats applied wealh middle class bill different 
while generally inclined agree many nations tried incredibly different circumstances 
you need keep within reasonable rate risk if put taxing make absolutely inhibit growth innovation tax around amount economy grows annually likely see less avoidance fraud get money back 
accidently flooded que posting many warren articles summer assume reported people like 
got banned commenting potus likely die heart attack finishing second term 
got banned telling troll go play traffic 
like way corporate tax plan works under current law companies incentive report high profits shareholders reporting low irs this tax would based entirely book reduce claim theyre worth investors 
speak people power if want non pedophile example look manafort i'm one pointed heritage the topic hand rich powerful men 
maybe relevant considering harvey currently pre trial scumbag trying manipulate public justice system recent back surgery use walker going court proceedings now powerless control anything get sort leniency judge prosecutors you probably pay attention news like know prompted bring fact one black jewish sexual abuse comes race gender creed etc power irrelevant 
removed rule dividing democrats civility 
probably pricks reddit given dedicated bots site warren bashing 
she bernie two truthful people politics i'm glad near top gives hope even pocahontas slur turned correct although still found way slam dna test 
it woman left the right wingers invaded bernie movement act like support website use drive wedge progressive they literally planned chan 
i'll push back make points first big problem massive wealth brings velocity money dramatically that isnt helping economy moving this reason trickle doesnt work give case allow retain wealthy people dont spend way causes change hands stimulate growth second we're serious think concerns power imbalance political economic cultural etc current state inequality allows support measure would actually reduce rather simply slow expansion 
geez my ban suggesting bernie drop could happen time 
yes actually simplify work companies keeping two entire sets books one tax purposes management reporting it reduce bunch high priced consultants lawyers though probably good thing economy overall 
hey shoot messenger if thought intentional interacted first place 
we gotta stop pretending like kinds comments machines people russia take moment check post history they're always experience obviously humans live united states pretending ignoring real problem 
it's reddit though twitter even worse 
i'll push back make points first big problem massive wealth brings velocity money dramatically that isnt helping economy moving this reason trickle doesnt work give case allow retain wealthy people dont spend way causes change hands stimulate growth the almost always invested stocks bonds very trapped vault factually play getting politics would wonderful things strength democracy tax best impact corruption small fortunately different plan 
yup forever also got banned democrats linking sub today saw membership number go call win 
exactly accused russian troll facebook telling lady clearly hypocrite racist towards mexicans spouting liberal nonsense page go see mentioned person argument still insisted some people stupid baffling know use social media 
why would malicious reporting get permaban that sucks 
proud dems ban someone getting downvoted claiming sub anti trump nothing candidates responded screenshot top topics republicans trolling 
working families party endorses elizabeth warren 
the discussion thread longer productive please treat kindness side 
https twitter com workingfamilies status was blowout per statement endorsement warren got ranked choice vote sanders 
this obviously cool i'm slightly annoyed nyt managed get scoop us voted wfp's endorsement process found 
there divisive talk thread i'd like remind everyone rule dividing democrats although warren sanders competing endorsements nomination ultimately team it okay disagree either candidate please refrain degrading supporters 
they endorsed bernie good they're endorsing liz even better that simple 
oh god slammed defending decision replies bernie stans insufferable sometimes i'm glad support progressive candidate irk like fascists but hate warren much maddening 
wow pretty big win bernie supporters furious 
it looks like far castro wfp endorsement candidate put honor nominated type statement sanders booker de blasio running well harris originally dropped rather live something 
this pretty stunning considering endorsed sanders remember correctly the warren dynamic shifting 
just heard email this awesome 
gosh bernie bro's ladies happy most comments call corporatist sell hard imagine would pass purity test 
think he's drop and i've said money organization go till end i'd dropping sooner later energy bernie behind warren 
oml berners furious bernie purist saint 
vote comes leadership members they going release official tallies separate votes like 
when realize bernie bros actually russian trolls everything say makes sense better ignore 
hope come around general election 
i'm sure however many supporters russians republicans pretending progressives they need manufacture division democratic party trump stand chance 
hard imagine would pass purity test the answer always bernie when isnt change 
no way bernie dropping time soon in stayed long clear win see reason believe 
idk billionaires bad wealth tax actually greatest hit imo 
your comment removed violation rule please familiarize rules https www reddit com elizabethwarren 
think meant say cheated million voters preferred clinton sanders but let facts get way good conspiracy theory 
no one winning general without big money to say otherwise foolish the gop already built large war chest corporations wall street rich shelling cash keep tax cuts continued fuck working class what funding source compete outside 
honestly bernie's inability collect contain toxic elements fan base main motivation going warren time around they're really insufferable he's gone stacked campaign full even though like guy agenda terrible decision making makes think temperament get done stuff promising 
know seen literally politics post recently it's crazy toxic mischaracterizations make sure note they're voting sanders still want attribute mostly bots malice part campaign another candidate respect i've personally experienced enough real life static self avowed bernie bros stans really less optimistic wish things better they i'm could vote cheerfully general lack kindness decency would validate 
ya opposite self care man 
yeah seems strange if think comments unfavorable warren sucks live age wonder percentage social media platform come real people rather shills bots 
remember many bullshit russians republicans pretending progressives they need manufacture division democratic party trump stand chance 
it's like leftist version maga hats burning nikes 
warren support bernie even though clearly candidate closest politically instead played politics tried butter hillary possible spot administration she get vp end waste anyway furthermore accepting money corporate donors general election so maybe calling shill inch far damn certain i'm bitter role remember wishing would also run and dream sanders ticket drawn head perhaps that's still something hope can't help feel resentment towards edit y'all keep downvoting i'd love hear compelling argument saying 
that's always case though they're vocal minority they're real toxic pretending russian bots going make exist thankfully vast majority way 
then couple senior staff looking sirota sure he embodies concept bernie bro if they're russians 
they delusional if warren wins primary progressive candidate probably ever seen presidential election 
these conspiracy theorists probably talked said would sit election when supporters basically saying person closest ideologically anti christ much hope luckily minority unlike last time bernie reign people trump win 
these conspiracy theorists probably talked said would sit election when supporters basically saying person closest ideologically anti christ much hope luckily minority unlike last time bernie reign people trump win 
mean bernie's still leading warren early states rcp polling let's get cocky 
see either think iowa nh goes poorly based everything i'm seeing win even worse time around 
i'm fan concerned enforceability offshoring incentives relatively minor concern 
because shady implying things without actually saying 
like dudes understand could voted closed door backroom kind endorsement deal became nonpaying wfp member vote hard complicated something 
there thread tax plan leftist group i'm several people started what about sanders saying stolen watered version fake progressive etc meanwhile would higher payoff https www gq com story warren sanders rich warren's camp shared the washington post last week takes form annual percent wealth ultra millionaires possess million assets rate increase billion economists advising warren estimate families less americans affected to preempt sort accounting hijinks inevitably ensue also boosts funding irs imposes mandatory audit payers one time penalty anyone attempts evade taxation renouncing citizenship projected ten years cool trillion sanders outdone provided thursday details preferred mechanism radical redistribution this overhaul estate lowering threshold payment create mid tier brackets applicable figures' worth restore top marginal abolished it closes notorious loopholes includes measures prevent farmers whose business make likelier subject shouldering heavy burden his staff emphasizes affect fortunate enough inherit mere by die however kind integral aspect levying number balloons there's reason touted scarier two i'd happy either president hold types supporters brand fan 
agree it yikes voted bernie primary years trump tired bullshit extremists need someone progressive ideas policies understand really like people time trying bring democratic party together convince move right direction edit vote dem including also think good guy sincere this extremist element supporters even possible bernie bust hostile foreign elements take hold 
honestly get movement hostility most warren supporters met similar objectives incredibly civil disagreements policy it 
this thousand times getting banned sandersforpresident saying warren decent option pushed camp imagine administration wanna militant children 
it help decided make people like bri joy important parts campaign 
hear guys matter do not go negative op say facts calmly stop get emotional i'm guilty anyone but try best sanders supporters biden everyone liz consensus choice we need represent 
in bernie defense never heard personally dick supporters candidates and sowing dissent democrats part russian influence campaign try take stuff especially online grain salt edit forgot word russian 
get argument want believe they're bots view represent real supporters drowned fast 
weird russian republicans etc latch sanders supporters one else do consider someone cannot control supporter's narrative gullible seen organized toxic candidates candidate's whether take biden warren harris anyone else's 
nothing left bad fascism even bernie's insufferable stans still want better future 
her everyone else surprised well bernie able clinton even primary close warren's endorsement never going change anything would support based aoc cast lot hillary means hurting nominee throwing away progressive influence clinton's expected presidency remember warren convince first lady get bill pull bankruptcy bill she knew talk could move good directions maintaining relationship real tangible benefit politics trivial thing toss aside 
bernie mathematically https www youtube com watch nhs oulac eliminated one month warren endorsed hillary clinton nbcnews politics election elizabeth warren endorse clinton rachel maddow show chance winning pledged delegates months convention politico blogs dem primary live updates results math says bernie sanders finished en wikipedia org wiki democratic national convention 
instead played politics tried butter hillary possible spot administration no there zero proof beyond saying would taken vp role course offered accepting money corporate donors general election she say said rule anything right 
the users obsessed hillary talk rigging etc definitely real people still bitter they say they're outraged warren talking try pretend secret two women must something nefarious tell would really weird they're disappointed pariah 
dismiss trolls spread false misleading information order sow division 
and she'll likely select diverse running mate draw voters color like need bernie busters anyhow please pick stacey abrams andrew gillum senator warren 
not significant margin right liz leading bernie iowa https www realclearpolitics com epolls president ia iowa democratic presidential caucus html 
no he's iowa enough polls prove conclusion new hampshire tossup warren quite well california even seen either way quit lying 
not state strategy she's delegates biden sanders half amount 
i'm concerned enforceability offshoring incentives she's calling surge irs funding shifting priority high dollar fraud evasion enforcement the economists worked built rate proposal there's flat exit tax anyone trying expatriate wealth in world makes congress things well 
guess president knows tools available crack billionaires invincible career based holding elite class accountable 
yes implying leadership vote allowed win like super delegate process they release results individual would show bernie popular but subreddit ok narrative people voted warren case 
the top post sanders president sub telling everyone vote bernie they actively trying circumvent ranked choice voting system it rules really annoyed put list warren 
like dudes understand could voted lot people ones trouble wrapping heads around primary registration deadlines 
there's reason warren's touted scarier two rich sanders talks terms regular people get super either take seriously never pass done watered ways think skirt around fairly trivial estate planning tax avoidance schemes gunning places directly impact ability influence public policy market dynamics that's scares it's even money fact they'll confront fair competition business cultures based monopoly throwing weight bully little guys work anymore prepared 
or david condense bernie's farts drink dessert sirota 
yes true know fringe online activists representative sample supporters blame personally but still agree yoga fuego way supported bernie excited cycle many friends clinton hard feelings class bros fwiw also people pretty obnoxious right hey running time point bernie's fault act actions consequences one dozens mostly women could never look eye ask support if warren run i'd probably backed quietly would willing join movement like 
bernie personally dick anyone he's hired attack dogs like david sirota briahna joy gray dicks suspect nastiness others twitter etc feature bug 
my worst interactions bernie supporters person friends i've known years calling corporatist sell one speak became insufferable problematic followers online 
he gets absolutely credit keeps hiring top advisors letting crybaby bs slide totally culpable 
never heard personally dick supporters candidates supported personal integrity level terrible response nevada caucus looked back 
weird sowing dissent part happens sanders supporters candidate's supporter he need personally dick everyone knows lift finger stop spreading propaganda if easy every candidate would equal dicks 
this part perplexes by accounts sanders pretty fair minded stand person candidate certain flavor attracted campaign others 
and sowing dissent democrats part russian influence campaign it troubled seem like sanders really gets responsibility keep stuff pointed right direction or idea plenty obnoxious clintonites around they're pretty quiet time i've seen probably split pete beto harris toxicity scattered get wants decentralized people powered movement but means able page presenting position well instead alienating everyone step line petulant 
this post removed violating rule dividing democrats 
think that's true campaign lies intended divide democrats targets sanders supporters they target candidate believe actions help elect trump however supporter remains good russian republican already previous election work 
disagree the either side goes extreme look like become hard tell apart 
aoc elizabeth warren progressive lion champion working families commitment inclusivity exemplary thank role model propose put lion emoji twitter handles bios show support woman 
doesn't hurt big political figures endorsed except castro ma politicians today they're singing praises come sooner mean know endorsement game started late clyburn days ago klob pete beto powerful people gillibrand booker inslee senators connie schultz help clearly awe campaign 
aoc great going judge endorsement bc free country support wants way ever decides run president 
want rage hard aoc sigh could got behind inclusive woman different situation right 
contrast ilhan thanks aoc happy went bernie admire you saved candidacy carried back gives hope progressive future centered around women power 
wonder many stop impulsively looking snake first 
you look comments see left woman believe loyal man bernie sanders vs one elizabeth warren flood supporters coming aoc's defense it's respect women know place backing these feminist values anti it matter endorses backs she judged right that make mistake aoc endorsed would called lying snake love call how something obvious acknowledged 
aoc prominent bernie supporter ounce common sense coalition building ability supporters like liberal case trump clown attacked https imgur com ub nylz jpg tmpn 
could get behind aoc candidacy next several years if warren badass progressive look forward 
aoc seems strong smart enough realize dangerous cult behavior become anyone named bernie really hope solidly distance future 
don't think could sent tweet inundated snake emojis aoc now feels self serving 
aoc future party hope president one day 
know still stings an endorsement aoc going go one what sentiments media try make story future create drama clickbait but what's done warren need battles ahead 
honestly tempting snarky decision support bernie she agency perhaps felt degree personal ideological loyalty man good right believe aoc along example ro khanna missing bernie's many surrogates supporters worst impulses build impossible purity tests dismiss everyone meet murderers basically burn bridges agree her messages positive always keeping door open and seems reform party rather destroy if warrendemocrat becomes thing hope part 
ahem sorry butt lion sounds like lying it designation ted cruz trump gave nickname lyin' we find better feline perhaps tiger would apt 
over course campaign respect sen warren gotten stronger aoc much 
being lion senate much compliment considering last person hold title ted chapaquidic kennedy 
her words ring hollow decided endorse eight year old heart attack completely changed race made consolidating around viable progressive impossible enjoy redistricting 
can use lion emoji even though guy 
you'd think reddit anonymity would worse somehow twitter people put real name face manage even vile 
always good rule thumb unfortunately 
twitter worst can't bring use 
understand endorsed disappointed this primary season made question support rockstar esque reps senators not sure feel but guess public loves that's vote dunno 
and naral pro choice groups endorse why emily's list sit sidelines klob dropped it make sense wait woman left you're basically saying everyone else good women women's rights if eulogies historic can't ever win part elect president smh 
if nyt solely endorsed instead splitting endorsement may actually made impact but decided split one took seriously anymore 
it hurt disgusted little late endorser resent sat sidelines altogether tweeting support today they take hot takes stuff we woman president hands could've impact this squarely left leadership 
doesn't hurt big political figures endorsed except castro ma politicians today they're singing praises come sooner think danger trying straddle line progressive establishment results progressives endorse candidate whilst establishmentarians leaving elizabeth awkwardly middle 
my theory thought done point want piss incoming administration definitely cowardly surprising 
think bloomberg poor performances primaries people want endorse someone last place 
would depending others if ayanna pressley running got vote locked loaded doubt but aoc progressive vs bunch yeah pick 
did sent tweet like take task bernie supporters warren flooded snake emojis 
from i've seen twitter campaign nothing supportive addresses understand supported bernie credits inspiring run office talib though edit voice text racist tlaib meant ilhan omar far know wonderful 
i'll judge stood warren happened 
helping defeat evil empire yes 
bernie mentor endorsed campaign running no fault returning favor she supportive warren twitter throughout 
it okay we rage little 
keep thinking endorsed bernie really tipping point solidly front runner weird spiral around funding started declining love aoc often think would happened warren instead heart surgery one worst debate performances like signs pointing towards getting early 
nah blame aoc dsa much closer bernie ideologically warren 
exactly if lion working families endorse year old socialist right heart attack she's also made dishonest digs warren it's going take time angry 
how dare support someone believed right 
and get called traitor acknowledge sanders done enough work for realizing slogan mean anything put real plan place behind same hate getting saying warren hope endorsement worth 
understand people believe aoc endorsement would big game changer yes lot support social media especially twitter sanders online outweighed bidens probably really indicate much came primary time also almost every candidate directly pushed endorsed outside presidency lost races outside news publicity shown dig impact endorsements 
bernie think personally hand campaign really much choice respect decision loyal 
ilhan made similar statement let undersell power elizabeth warren candidacy she set pace policy everything disability justice racial wealth tax giant movement can't wait progressive build together thankyouelizabeth https twitter com ilhanmn status as rashida ayanna 
have considered aoc prefers sanders warren 
think warren aoc vp would killer ticket bernard cronies could actually pull successful progressive presidency 
she's smarter bernie dunno whether youth personality aoc least flexibility communication skills thing expects everyone come board in respect think similar elizabeth 
she positive work bringing bernie crowd measured energy lot good raising movement absolutely pay future elections 
distance dude she's gonna talk soo much shit runs bernie aoc shes fucking bronx that's us nyers love 
if wants future national politics needs distance soon she intelligence capability president one day that start though 
gotta get stuff passed congress first though so far talk implementation 
aoc incredibly intelligent think decision wavered personal ideological loyalty of course probably admire met recent years aware bernie's supporters sexism racism i'm sure virtually young non white people women internet highly racist sexist attacks constantly however happening throughout childhood kind vitriol permeates society often showcased bernie draws lot support working class various races genders it's frustrating someone suggests obviously lived experience as assessment would say ideologically consistent she reluctant compromised special interests compromise values efforts make other's happy admits certain positions taken calling socialist hinder chance becoming president interested thinking politically endorsed sanders likely believed movement ideology quite since also spoken warren progressive politics help families these views exclusive feel similarly preferred get nomination age debate performance ideas wealth tax hard important many future country everyone feels differently know respect agency missing obvious things 
well sometimes my favorite warren emasculate bloomberg national television those debates soooooo satisfying 
totally see warren running around philly eye tiger 
see bernie brigaders downvoting they think sub always 
thought aoc chance support warren mattered she thanks thanks 
for life can't understand anyone public figure would want real name likeness attached twitter handle too much risk far right using harass 
think voting system helps people subreddit terrible 
people usually act civil reddit fear getting banned downvoted say something really bad twitter get acc worst case scenario blocked 
you can't downvote twitter think helps since tweets treated equally 
the people rated klob equally worthy warren simply woman candidate like idiots nytimes sort put aesthetics politics much crucial differences policy it's infuriating 
think real story knew best choice elite consensus would never get behind hedged late 
left leadership particularly democratic parties deciding let guy hates party run primary 
think ayanna best orator dems right far she invokes fdrs ghost listen could lock presidency run voters fearful 
it's honestly refreshing see many strong progressive ladies elected latest cycles makes america's future look less depressing 
la ib hope typo racist freudian slip 
lot us it got little attention 
haha aoc's game whole time she's afraid slide nerd stuff lol the ewoks looked jokes even smallest warrior make difference 
creature star wars return jedi looks like https vignette wikia nocookie net starwars images wicket rotj png revision latest cb 
prior run congress organiser sanders dem nomination campaign given mutual history endorsement surprise 
imagine endorsed warren back we would way 
our revolution got elected she either felt like actually endorse 
my take endorse bernie cause position puts female progressives especially ones elected backed like look pushback elizabeth got endorsing idk right thoughts 
he invited rally queens not sure warren ever acknowledged existed 
actually agree aoc she gets intersectionality bernie way warren democrat revolutionary 
blame aoc dsa much closer bernie ideologically warren surprised grew idolizing it still hurts timing killed momentum understand 
we listen poc long agree everything think 
bernie notably endorse wish loyal progressive movement one guy 
warren officially woman youngest presidential candidate she appeal progressive moderate base party vote electable vote 
i've phone banking elizabeth warren even people planning vote say oh love happy nomination she really unity candidate 
technically tulsi still running liz youngest yet 
please please consider volunteering it's real reason warren still thing she strong showing volunteers tell make feel better life actively something it also makes vote compound if convince person effect election someone voted volunteer that's incredible 
really hoping see repeat the party needs unite behind candidate wings would happy 
really consider tulsi race yes technically still candidate dropped statistically significant serious way 
if cards warren everyone think vp either sanders biden just fyi i'm strong supporter stealth we get trying push drop she stay long chooses imo 
being woman matter warren best candidate period if candidates women she'd men would as stands may bit oddball care unity we need map country going make better everyone person 
she's one could realistically healthily complete terms by time done she'd bernie biden's age sanders still released health update heart attack less months ago 
so odd one think warren best choice bunch feel like rally around sanders if vote gets delegates see path victory what benefit get this serious question plan voting tomorrow i'm truly torn 
man big mad warren fighting july oh well they deal 
biden lose reasons hillary lost resist status quo 
not gonna lie agree paper path forward warren start winning primaries probably still vote running ny primary rolls around struggling understand viability point 
wish warren moved slightly towards center little earlier but really think opportunity show better candidate bernie biden especially bloomberg 
underestimate forgotten tulsi majority peril lmao also please prove wrong im biden stop sanders but guys make happen april th ill part holding early voting see happens 
hope end endorsing sanders she's much better two candidates 
as undecided voter tell right away pulling woman card followed age wise furthermore progressive moderate this plea seem well guided imho 
youngest presidential candidate means nothing 
my mom brother live super tuesday state both like warren lot mom's die hard feminist we're set voting although wait april insists sanders there's way win we talk every night spent hour trying convince exactly electable people vote didn't manage accomplish much except getting worked almost started crying tried ultimately reason anyone unelectable cure gasp shock go 
warren supporters knock door weekend also said unity candidate the confusing part pivoted pushing policy attacking competition can explain concept 
tulsi gabbard woman color even almost half warren's age if we're uncomfortable media's erasure liz 
there trending warren endorse bernie hmmm help wonder maybe election caliber always choice old white dudes another dude billionaire tagging little longer keep entertaining 
honest question path point because looking polls viable states tomorrow nearly enough get majority even plurality milwaukee after losing bunch primaries think super delegates obvious choice latest speeches make sound like it happened fast everyone dropped odd island 
what woman's problem mean seriously we know going get job fox news spends time attacking democratic party 
wait i'm still election every time tulsi sees news mention candidates running apparently easy run president anything 
i'm glad something like top comment 
wow gained whole percent go tulsi 
smh even remembering mosie boyd mosieboydorelection'svoid 
yeah convinced dad vote super tuesday he kind moderate freaked bernie willing go warren people bit trust democrat whole time office call socialist ambitious ultimately pragmatic work today wondering drop support mods biden think smart stay first things change quickly still shot nominee buttigieg supporters chose second choice polls secondly keep promoting progressive ideas people listen whatever reason if something happens joe might situation big number uncomfortable bloomberg capture middle votes make deals convention 
exactly warren winning perceived electability argument but inexplicable reason year old heart attack survivor democratic socialist another candidate degenerating cognitively electable best prepared qualified woman ever run progressive side aisle president do better america 
yep follow know think americans terrible ready female president 
see well liked voters really turned consistently enough wish ran hilary establishment would tried run sucks race sudden got much thinner might help land delegates hard say quick dropouts pete amy vote tomorrow i'm strategy progressive lane since tied first 
with much fox news thought republican 
warren's volunteer game on point there many volunteers hard give something sometimes we're crushing 
yes got conference call volunteers elizabeth give us pep talk lit 
is opportunity send texts emails elizabeth phone anxious 
had sanders biden run i'm convinced would united party better candidate warren one others 
fluke hillary clinton presumptive heir abdicated obama sanders threw wrench works this election different there innumerable options policy positions we've winnowed challengers narrowed field dynamics first four primaries everything shifting we sorting wheat chaff rest march 
it's unavoidable no one going get majority delegates 
that's running fox news pundit president 
personally would major reservations accepting vp spot biden also think happens he needs either youth person color 
could happy biden warren ticket not sanders 
rather senate majority leader secretary treasury vp someone else administration instead head think either would go anyway need somebody years younger 
find discussions pointless we campaign advisors vote nominate vps 
governor mass republican could replace senator 
her joining biden would really weird he's completely opposite she'd want corporate dem that's backing fighting forever it basically turn resume 
she might work well vp biden see sanders picking 
she would much effective senate 
biden warren low key despise wasted vice president well better remain senate 
tough call vote conscience but benefit delegates bernie outnumbers biden contested convention wider margin alone and also path anti coalitions need find alternative 
if delegates say comes writing platform convention getting concessions eventual nominee honestly much better path victory field winnowed couple days ago there still lot people want either bernie biden warren win finally genuinely think best bunch vote don psych 
feel like rally against sanders so weird find divisive trump with warren plans there's record know i'm quickly becoming biden train because kamala abrams vp that's selling point think best candidate ashamed fellow citizens realizing but need beat the aca another appeal scotus come we can't four years 
think sanders wins plurality warren would give delegates so safe vote state convention voice therein 
she's continuing primary order play kingmaker event contested convention nobody get majority delegates based endorsement clinton bernie see giving anybody biden 
honestly think biden bernie warren beat trump also three could lose but i'm pretty sure would far effective presidency 
i'm actually pretty confident end we'll rally behind nominee it's easy complain candidates trump literally look fantastic 
bernie lose reasons mcgovern corbyn lost 
so support trump biden nominee vote blue no matter who anyone selfish asshat 
amazing one else seems realize 
exactly and unfortunately joe entirely he's gaffe machine trump's insult 'sleepy joe' based reality 
states delegates apportioned contenders left represent non overlapping interests except maybe beating trump 
think also make age argument debates 
i'm centrist month ago decided completely believe warren's judgment wants get done people she cares much people's livelihoods evidenced amount detail plans care ideology getting positive outcomes if democrats talk warren concerns listen and thinks valid she'll change but first foremost aim lift poverty financial insecurity hurtful discrimination that's i'll stick behind regardless whatever platform 
mean absolutely progressive wish she'd focus policies mainstream appeal 
wish warren moved slightly towards center little earlier moving centre lost ground bernie if would made far 
only one exceeded average life expectancy 
youngest presidential candidate means nothing intention voting democratic nominee begin 
wait til wednesday throwing towel 
at moment unity versus division sanders base run incredibly divisive campaign which seeing happen right 
if leftists actually care progressive policies becoming law vote warren 
president warren replace insecure voting systems hand marked paper ballots require risk limiting audits mandate early day registration federal elections 
in addition state elections follow rules fully funded federal government bonus achieving high voter turnout estimated cost billion paid closing loopholes estate tax 
yes waiting plan like can't wait read at work warren's plans long dense properly get minutes throughout day 
thank heavens someone finally addressed election security it biggest issue 
our voting system insecure president 
early vote simply making election day holiday 
great policy hope could get unanimous democratic support 
so glad we need election security 
um paper ballets miscounted thrown trash this regressive we move voting app everyone phones banking apps secure 
ms warren isnt going accomplish anything campaign money source dries im frustrated cant give what manager 
estate tax death term popularized make people think impacted rather millions time 
looks like one came june agree high time nonetheless candidate addressed issue 
and mean finally fair elections take senate pass really progressive legislation 
for unaware electoral reforms rcv needed cgp grey great videos topics series politics animal kingdom the problems first past post voting explained https www youtube com watch twhjfhiyo list plklbh kzphe qu mcw leef xsxpk fie minutes instant runoff je hse index single transferable vote xozjkozfi mixed member proportional representation qt sdosxu presented could significantly strengthen democracy would ensure vote matters give lesser two evils voting genuinely make difference government even live safe gerrymandered district 
that's plan federal standards federal elections we election jurisdictions running problems resources malfeasance errors rampant no ensure everyone vote including mandating automatic day registration early voting mail my mean arbitrary voter purges issues and gerrymandering also make election day holiday easier people get polls 
make election week everyone right paid time vote but still holiday last day since many procrastinate minute and early voting available 
that true paper ballots always watched people different beliefs you would need parties independents decide throw on miscounting miscounted either small enough margin change results close recount it impossible securely vote app without removing anonymity when bank username password link account with voting possible also apps hacked glitch way easier paper know happening ballot every cheat already tried thwarted knows actually worked what fake pretended real one bunch voted wrong never seen anyone non anything it not everything constantly changing order progressive somethings proven work point 
it literally tax imposed dying 
if take senate pass laws 
know she one heard talk ev feel though making election day holiday enough retail service industry workers would still work could honestly see becoming another memorial labor companies capitalize sales whatnot early voting allows days make polls brilliant 
what care you dead lived whole life fortune die accountants pay tax estate literally 
millions dollars choosing give away even need anymore 
only worth millions hence estate tax 
if take senate pass laws until but meantime ton executive actions needs she nothing even stuck lets 
not necessarily would think insecure elections fall grave threat national security executive actions could taken defend enemies domestic foreign 
blue wave would extremely unlikely americans short memories 
good thing republicans care national security fight tooth nail stack courts hyper partisan hacks 
maybe right but think people short memory many would complain it remember different things individually so something big happens leaves deep lasting impact feel supposed someone else for instance permanently changed event happened prior new events affect deeply this permanent change also others every finally even overestimated changes past years give trying going fight then and got one life planning using despair cynicism 
what chances would've fought anyway not discount experience folks say knocking doors would voted every time most people paying close attention many get roused action quiet president setting shit fire this especially true swing states 
actually guess know would done trump steady improvement previous years obama vs mccain first election able vote looked little bit thoughts can't tell telling truth lying they seem pluses minuses sides generally trying make things better when romney research last time came conclusion both going try different ways either fine in thought really need start paying attention local stuff but manage year learned quite lot formed strong well informed opinion waited primary independent think allowed party picked voted had awful importantly house republicans defending unanimously throughout entire process way less activated only stay whole life like saying fact working bad 
it sounds even trump slowly becoming political pretty common really hate throw water enthusiasm heard stories people bush administration went nowhere not given whole generation manosphere assholes republican party the way turn ending disaster demonstrate ideas actually work happens win senate discard filibuster pass big fucking bills otherwise gonna another parties came elections 
really hate throw water enthusiasm no worries boundless optimism exactly useful bottomless cynicism we strive measure reality throw much like heard stories people bush administration and would say change the country large diverse place people activated turned obama presidency then black man white house many politically active lead trump win changed due disappear votes stop mattering it means road long one pit stops blocks require back tracking way happened awful republican party defended yes trending towards action but point previously plateaued senate discard filibuster pass big fucking bills i'll work hope if fail ish years life going use best ability see reason give despair hopelessness need results match desires know currently maybe current strategy actually when learn better until forget forward

warren reports million nd quarter donations 
this great news people getting concerned silence numbers she really gaining momentum seemingly sustainable fashion very excited 
tbh getting nervous bit expected recent rise money would coming if raise similar amount next quarter think shows core base financial support sanders push campaign way 
for reference puts ahead harris sanders quarter behind biden buttigieg however bernie avoiding courting big dollar donors makes hauls particularly impressive 
this is huge with cash hand senate campaign huge haul warren well positioned keep slow burn rise iowa she needs money going expand this such good news 
pure donations transfer senate campaign still want my personal donation call damn it lol 
yaaaaas this strong data point confirming warren campaign solid momentum and fact small donors makes particularly meaningful significant share voters want candidate plans country future two things heavily criticized donor fundraising policy driven exactly right prescription tired bs parties 
going donate primary keeping powder dry speak general when biden came felt compelled little would ok canvassing candidates i'm sure 
even doubted grassroots abilities stronger bernie amazing news 
donate monthly chipped extra debate glad see going strong feel pretty defeatist politics lately liz would really change things if deliver blue senate 
oh getting concerned since felt like taking numbers released but solid number 
omg happening no big donor fundraisers baybee we grassroots movement gals boys edubs killing 
most individual donors campaign periodt feeling weather day news needed turn monday around team warren 
lol remember https www vanityfair com news elizabeth warren campaign fundraising amp 
now even people fence great reason donate 
donated today rewatched segment ari melber's show announced break big tech plan resist donating longer 
i've donated times i'm going set monthly was thinking month realized phone wife's paid might put money warren well 
million makes excited big donor money comes general it help get close making financial playing field fair hundreds millions trump rnc hand 
phew getting worried silence perhaps campaign team waiting lull news push front runners posted capitalize cycle this great liz her knows spend money well no offense buttigieg fans courting big wealthy donors live ma heard thousand dollar guest dinner nantucket vineyard senator warren smaller average donation true grass roots candidate two almost 
think great significant worries divided democratic party these candidates need put shit aside unite biden clown place race example bernie could use influence pass torch idk buttigieg stands the partitioning support lose election again right it's trump 
now i'm thinking think strategy she waiting top contenders biden sanders harris buttigieg release fundraising numbers 
yeah breathe collective sigh relief 
do forget screenshot want donor flair 
so impressive it fundraising stance got first donate started transition bernie liz really glad paying 
head harris campaign got debate means raised rest quarter surprised underwhelming supposed top tier candidate far one moment 
donated honestly care there's big donors legally limited disclose but agree haul fire 
gonna make iowa very least yes big news if become recurring donors deal think story resonants thus convince ppl monthly 
yes and want win contest tell dream ended early intervention together toddler autism she might find little weird nice 
got call ma number thought could no car warranty scam 
donated hra started giving free stickers 
ditto wife planning donating primary whoever general we've already donated warren i'm verge saying fuck afford right ensure nominee biden 
canvass current realistic candidates besides biden and prefer trump obviously would even close think win want waste time it also hard make compelling case talk people really believe 
million baby take stupid vanity fair 
eh mean bankrupt deny reasonable luxuries sake potus candidate 
i've always done month candidate it's much something 
agreed thinking thing also slow primary news front perfect day take headlines 
think right know good strategy 
she probably waiting july holiday people would paying bit attention 
honestly think may making sure numbers right there's need first something correct they're thorough 
yep and proud every time bucks threw never donated campaign feel like afford warren wins might work die desk 
she's candidate set monthly donations though like several primarily idea completely ignoring large donors struck chord i'm glad one 
donate point via reddit warren link 
she bernie fundraising stance right 
harris planning attack biden weeks made comment hope keeps falling polls 
it's less actually big donors candidate campaign court people pop onto actblue wire they're organizing dumb dinners parties candidates mingle everyone money get ear voice concerns like warren says that's time spent away people help physically ground 
hear iowa staff huge compared everyone else she playing keeps smart enough know way win nh if established move southern primaries easily picked biden harris natural connection aa voters dominate 
she could dinner party donation events like candidates big donors instead going sends bailey 
plan maxing primary hopefully general that said donate afford you table warren host party message friend much https elizabethwarren com warren 
that's good sign win makes general vote damn hope 
maybe donors specifically quarter rather entire campaign 
like said entirecampaign donations but also bernie mailing list warren so new people signing very indicative grassroots support 
our girl liz smart campaigner 
same it much month also donate larger amounts afford 
just message mods also happy cake day 
we'd prefer via reddit warren either way receipt 
harris rising polls biden dropped little bit 
much love warren luxury saying rolled million first quarter allowed set early states get name other less well known candidates can't average person never run president and stop current campaign fundraising route think gets general election she'll running superpac money billionaires trump might adjust fault if allow superpacs probably need bigger donors lieu 
meant enough money get iowa caucus next year but yes staff ages ago what worried support among poc hope see rise lot coming months her messages places really well immigrants black voters and great messenger townhall large crowd people forum performance stellar 
she would seems like thing find endearing 
he represents important firewall appearance corruption 
and raised money without purr sist cat collars available store think many millions would seriously great news 
you're allowed donate twice maximum is two different years 
think appreciate able forecast donations helps even small amounts 
okay i'm going send screenshot i've donated far i'll channel angry something give campaign donations reddit link 
seems weird policy would impetus shifting support either direction 
that true but prime target yet by next round debates would expect history prosecutor brought positive light 
luxury mean less gamble her campaign finance director left decision made million first quarter despite 'major' candidate announce if gained traction yet debates like harris' could staring another low haul significantly hindering chances iowa probably losing race it's people believed would sink now room gillibrand buttigieg came name recognition sure that's already done work previously blame harris going money boy sure impressed pete's numbers reason 
it's two different campaigns think planned bernie get chance 
well technically liz first come strongly publicly policy high dollar fundraisers bernie fundraiser sf smallest ticket dollars largest she also calls small donors individually think pretty special 
boy sure impressed pete's numbers reason i'll push back point as name mayor literally one knew months ago raising biden former vp popular democrat even convincing ppl donate that's impressive this jeb bush situation legacy someone middle america steeping dc he connections fundraise extent pete mightly disclosure bulk donations warren pete edit that's say matter like mix peas carrots different subs

elizabeth warren overtakes joe biden favorite win democratic party's primary bookmaker 
priority primaries anybody biden general election trump warren sanders ticket would dream come true 
with joe flapping gums hits like millennials complain much lot trump supporters nice people mean corporations for someone criticized way hillary ran campaign certainly knows make worse 
like two think place ticket president if warren get nomination better senate impact legislation significant way ditto bernie the ideal running mate would probably someone less progressive popular swing red state someone rourke castro comes mind 
warren sanders makes zero sense you either want vp enhance electability improve ability govern neither 
warren stacey abrams would probably really well polls tbh 
get biden hate people act like mitt romney something policies solidly mainstream democratic case basically candidates farther left actually able implement he supposedly wanted warren vp decided run 
that's good point long term senator get lot stuff done damn i'll thing dream ticket 
castro lock vp warren wins she giving signs attitude campaign mirroring lot ways the optics ticket excellent would supercharge turnout 
that's solid reasoning you've changed mind 
warren prez sandy senate majority leader vice versa dream team 
abrams would good vp pick she's popular georgia appeal black vote 
true o'rourke narrowly lost senate race puts good position vp nom also young white guy south he's like perfect geographic demographic balance warren that said tend believe nobody votes based vice president candidate 
there lot bernie bust people helped trump get elected staying home writing depending support bernie may improve turnout general election 
yeah meant dream ticket sense if could pick president vp dreams thinking electability 
you're forgetting number people sexist unfortunately insignificant vote hillary purely woman 
if biden nominee i'll vote trump easily but i'd much rather get neoliberal rut corporate bailouts crumbling infrastructure military interventions militarized policing anemic social services spineless wishy washy liberalism delivers nothing compromise gop 
concerned cabinet it bunch goldman sachs alums and prepared end filibuster nothing would get done 
biden's theory politics stuck time things could actually get done working across aisle it's like spent entire tenure vp asleep clue mcconnell 
biden actually fix anything obama really put foot stopped probably thinking electability wish wouldve picked candidate wasnt supported they shot polls maybe still 
if biden policies meant considered farther left would win much worse 
think bernie would happy see elizabeth president she still holds lot progressive values policy wonk pretty sure get along well but ideal running mate probably castro hell read one hillary considerations vp however popular texas like say beto feel really generic debate pence 
personally would love pete vp and that's simply every fiber wants see debate pence 
my thing popular castro texas 
yeah mean help get cfpb implemented bernie office ideally democratic senate involved could really see lot good done plus seem relationship easily influencing policy via 
bottom line fuck mitch mcconnell what cartoonishly evil asshole 
think either warren sanders would good majority leaders that position requires building consensus among caucus extremely critical colleagues times exactly type 'make friends' sake i'm hoping see combination brian schatz chris murphy senate leadership next time get democratic majority 
abrams seems common choice remember open pretty much anyone minus biden doesn warren already well black voters though 
feel conflicted depends candidate appeal warren could progressives rourke centrists red states furthermore argue ideally vp balance main that means one younger older vice versa one balanced views appeals candidates swing beto likable far left elizabeth also palin believed impeded mccain campaign though argued going lose regardless people rebuked republicans bush years guess ends recession matter nominee 
think warren beto actually pretty similar i'd super happy see run together however kind white ticket even they're eloquent matters race would bit step backwards 
fuck people essentially they're saying trump second choice bernie since staying home throwing protest vote stein big part would win election happen 
ditto obama there's counteracting woman vote extent think hillary lost little bit reason doubt warren would at worst gender break even votes 
think folks wouldnt come first place they magnet trump hillary support actually really good party lost ec the didnt perform well black people bc low turnout if energize vote rust belt theyll get done 
those two areas legit difference something like learn for part expect mainstream well qualified picks obama my incomplete understanding plans get things via budget reconciliation you year opportunities midterms he use one healthcare expansion addressing climate change that definitely concern mine dunno though support among senators would try stop think less sign democratic congress if major goals accomplished without getting rid filibuster see want but yeah executive appointments attacking manage win senate worry might leave money table speak otoh best chance policies implemented run score election night democrats elected senate state offices currently seems good bet obviously ways really know appeals sorts blue collar white folks represented states need pick suburban swing voters us back house 
idk think electoral appeal actual expectation mcconnell work much least hope large number voters particularly swing want less division cooperation he trying run uniter relative trump divider the key getting anything done many people vote democrats every level deliberately win sort voted also eating little bit white blue collar base so concern mine might actually believe rosy picture aspirational but one thing like lot warren kinda cuts crap stuff begrudge biden right call back places pa helping senate candidates red states tx al nc sour convinces naive 
that saying agenda farther left democratic president going able implement biden candidate probably best represents democrats stand much republicans remember saw data nate silver talked positions closer average democrat hear people twitter nearly unlike warren sanders trying pull party particular direction represent dems already want particularly inspiring like right winger anything 
that's kind dream castro might smarter choice think pete rising star would great young inspiring persona alongside warren's taking things bit kamala harris ag stacy abrams head fec beto quite possibly cabinet positions well but big impossible want barack hussein obama come retirement secretary state and stare putin quick spies sanction fuck bernie needs command senate he stays he'll die point person legislative priorities 
my dream pete head dnc there recent daily episode tom perez talking gerrymandering supreme court case perez's response limp best what i've liked talks things like dc statehood changing structure he's longterm election strategy democratic party unafraid fight fire someone actually push party level incredibly important want chair that's willing say they're going call us socialists regardless rather cowing right wing news machine think buttigieg suited and i'd see run future 
see chance getting texas either way 
is open biden interested joining campaign point 
guess ends recession matter nominee though you mean dems would automatically win economy turns south no really assume 
reason decades republican fearmongering lies alongside russian propaganda dash help jim comey 
rather obama ag sos foreign policy weakest part presidency 
they say texas slowly turning blue probably fast enough 
https www buzzfeednews com amphtml darrensands joe biden stacey abrams rumors twitter impression true 
well yeah want start discussion people left still believe imagined history hillary horrible candidate whose sole reason winning cheating it tends take away actual 
that give impression ruled actually wins the real negative one mad adviser 
lol really admit glossed mainly referring abrams adviser however remember speaking favorably accepting position offered though my guess she'd willing buttigieg's vp 
she's pretty presidential ask sen warren trump deploy army corps engineers coronavirus help 
she miss step dropping she's still fighting good fight that's love 
where everyone else know brown booker others proposing things seems like liz work ten senators biden or sanders it easiest way campaign help americans right essentially operate shadow government addresses letters plans urgency either 
hate pushing plans getting credit see schumer propose additional combat coronavirus pandemic https www usnews com news politics articles schumer propose additional combat coronavirus pandemic single mention warren article 
honestly regret supporting bernie not anything wrong she clearly better choice 
it's awesome least getting little credit saving country bad back seat imagine would already done wheel 
seen multiple people countries asking rightfully woman president even nominee it good question also would like ask billionaires opposed candidacy bezos getting richer every second isolated america if bloomberg ing patriotic worth million dollars try going us money 
sorry army corp busy wall 
too bad media completely wrote favor dottering old man friendly wall street hopefully biden choose vp pick 
creepy ted cruz behind pic 
this thought far best candidate too bad people buy bullshit things matter governing like charisma familiarity 
re draft warren the one person trust meet crisis understanding decisiveness humility 
is doubt donald trump joe biden elizabeth warren room smartest person would 
you know would make even presidential people votes 
what odds biden chooses running mate it would great launching point run potus years biden's vp since we're going get one term anyway presumably 
yang supporter love warren bummed dropped genuinely looking forward voting really appreciate integrity data realistic plans bring actual progress hands one remaining candidates check boxes i'm thankful still working away us ever 
i'm sure thursday friday trump come tv twitter report plan getting help army corps engineers chinese kung flu clue what's happening unless someone else suggests first at least starting listen smart people jared fucking kushner gym jordan matt gaetz idiots fox news change 
she's pretty gutsy go talk trump shitty things says surprised laughed face 
the late senator paul wellstone used say could use ten progressives senate one elizabeth warren just imagine much get done talked president sigh 
know yang helping planning advice ubi thing he favorite candidate one following 
bernie talking idea joe biden warren best president senator though 
know work getting done that's enough years make sure everyone learns thank 
interesting i'm warren supporter would love hear substance behind take without shitting bernie felt way course heard buyer's remorse supporters wondering turning point etc 
while would amazing seriously ideally bridge gap biden sanders voters nicely suspect opposite the bbs vile seeing read coming board inject progressive ideas much how dare she chose him over bernie i'm voting trump now 
this i'm loathe consider vp slot she needs writing legislation sitting photo ops deputy commerce secretary philippines 
honestly yang warren pushing harder anyone handle maybe like said following others much see aoc acting vocal leaders right while hear lot bernie seems stick around talking points regardless virus just happens sorta mesh well cause universal healthcare 
biden talking warren's because course 
it's pervasive sexist trend embedded society men take credit women's work 
feel like bernie handle bs politicking well warren able explain policies concisely she witty charming her ability smack someone making point debate breathtaking would better president handling asked wrong questions again shitting unfortunately liked killing right still holding hope whoever gets nom taps vp need warren white house capacity 
i'm someone warren voted bernie knew ca super tuesday liz push top think better delivery their policy nearly tone makes difference my mom loved disliked she's older bucket tried tell voting biden basically lost aggressive messaging that's bit but kind fell people jumped stick guns that's seemed see drop support liked even though primary still wish could flipped positions going 
you also wonder many types bb's actually russian trolls 
they'll try can't let drown majority 
vp big role biden played important obama administration think warren could way effective senate you put box bet work senator and 
know already got selfie game seem slow feel trained vp duty 
we robbed warren yang ticket 
yes but i'd rather actual things getting done everyone flailing uselessly thank god warren leg work 
biggest thing noticed debates warren gave excellent depth answers bernie often rehashed stump speech unfortunately stumping good getting people excited without going details anything also think may sounded professor ish loved listening felt like class us politics but feeling taught the biggest issue warrens campaign sexist view men run potential women accomplishments warren nobody seemed give latter glad got vote though wasted matter sanders supporters try tell and book two income trap read well 
charming like warren bit stretch even think sanders obama disagreed policies 
yup get shit control everyone else gonna try swoop take credit 
believe wasted votes particularly primaries it way letting dnc know people want the vote progressive candidates better 
watch liz south carolina bar colbert tell charming 
agreed when bernie sanders got early leads lot reddit comments asking collecting votes front runners instead voting candidate want win politely tell people thought would make best president one chance winning 
warren we make election day national holiday federal elections minimum days early voting 
how come hear proposals republicans encourage political participation public 
found one thing warren proposes make sense 
voting mail much better washington state voter turnout general source https www sos wa gov elections research election aspx compared national 
when say loud sounds kind crazy norm already the average person support 
fucking love plan sorry language but really though 
it great idea andrew yang one policies well https www yang com election day holiday 
don't stop include primaries three midterms day set choose clinton sanders lost massachusetts student population firmly camp time desperately studied every second fear grades fully admit vote narrowly 
damn straight no voter suppression 
don't get wrong i'd love holiday really going improve things much poorer people usually work holidays how long election day sales white color already time vote extended voting though 
why ranked choice voting she spoke well ezra klein show 
want everybody vote goo https www youtube com watch gbasfwpglw 
can executive branch without legislative branch's support 
that's like much her policies detailed thorough 
love idea however wish helped low income voters anyone working retail restaurants ect benefit unfortunately open every day except christmas 
if insists guess us rational states vote mail hang couch day binge watch something 
know asking rhetorically want people voting they crowd old show everyone else stay home 
my grandma shared facebook cute meme said abolish electoral college california new york elect democratic potus rest lives that's truly believe democratic president scary get 
because 'democracy' mean think means according 
remind get rid electoral college without constitutional amendment 
love ideas except wealth tax how government know someone worth go house evaluate items 
they vote mail utah missed since moving away it best way 
the merrier election day standard view least among dems 
if helps narrow losses generally meaningful symbolically delegates split proportionately clinton got whopping delegate sanders 
i'm okay election day holiday part package also includes vote mail early voting agree much isolation 
white color people already get time vote they 
your points valid as question really going improve things much only one way find 
sadly accurate answer even ones might somewhat supportive idea willing speak majority perfectly happy keep obstacles way certain demographics voting when suppression class voters common practice nobody going bring 
california new york population combined also vast majority people happened live two states would make sense dominate politics the making decisions minority 
please remind eliminating ec actually get republicans vote two places 
not much get rid render moot national popular vote interstate compact https www nationalpopularvote com written explanation 
appoint justices call unconstitutional or use interstate compact constitutional amendment they seem insurmountable everyone keeps saying one guy passed prove professor wrong it takes effort 
most wealth form real estate already valued stocks bonds private businesses estimated the stuff hang walls largely noise though particularly valuable pieces could tracked updated inflation beyond someone passes bequeathed else it would happen frequently 
most wealth form real estate already valued stocks bonds private businesses estimated the stuff hang walls largely noise though particularly valuable pieces could tracked updated inflation beyond someone passes bequeathed else it would happen frequently 
it bring attention voting that's plus at least people eventually get time half 
freudian slip assuming meant collar 
many companies let leave vote usually higher pay likely 
not mention california's new york's registered voters include million republicans respectively those also people whose votes count abolishing electoral college would make every state purple 
commented back video https www youtube com watch wc hgla deleted post shortly lol sorry gram facts facts 
california new york it also funny skipped second third populous states texas florida discuss cali ny 
ah yes npvic what think nate silver argument though likely never passed enough red battleground states https fivethirtyeight com features plan circumvent electoral college probably doomed seems like warren much use bully pulpit try encourage state governments pass which would fine effort sure hope remember fight rest agenda enormous opposed giving away power effectively choose president 
remind maybe explain though would appreciate 
that last amendment ratified possible lot states back student found launched movement get onboard the ths ratification requirement nigh impossible age extreme polarization look wolfpac money politics tens thousands volunteers working issue bipartisan appeal years five it way tough also since electoral college explicitly detailed us constitution exactly appoint judges call unconstitutional argument could justified sc strike would unprecedented perhaps open flood gates radical moves which might nice in ways constitution perfect but imagine decision radicalize rightwing basically tearing founding document country as interstate compact read article nate silver difficult non blue board 
plus well people likely live areas served polling places making less burden employer allow time vote 
in state required let leave vote matter pay but actually work entire time polls open people hours 
it's ama you ask question 
it's year old account maybe made something 
yep california million registered republican voters all get effectively counted democrats every presidential election why okay it's fair reduces turnout statewide ballot elections makes people feel like vote matter this true non swing state so states texas major democrat stronghold new york strongholds and electoral college actually rural low population ultimately irrelevant politics would anyone ever visit wyoming idaho montana kansas utah oklahoma literally south except florida etc their foregone conclusion they always party nobody care exist in smallest received attention presidential iowa hampshire nevada got plenty mexico still time wv dc event maine nebraska also little crucially proportionally split delegates instead awarding winner take events ex governor johnson running libertarian ticket mcmullin neither last party ward third parties connecticut mississippi 
it's solid argument kind assumes voters ever vote tactically advantageous choice meanwhile florida elected republicans statewide elections also voted overwhelmingly reinstate voting rights felons see populous red state agree they're getting enough attention purple going blue join like colorado 
honestly lines areas esp neighborhoods color low income work like hours day 
agree everything said even though dad would disagree north carolina virginia south 
so saying good rural states ignored shit man utah lot fantastic communities democrats especially salt lake valley park city navajo res 
umm someone already beat punch but question basically warren strategy get rid impact electoral college presidential elections seeing unlikely constitutional amendment could passed 
not sure got comment i'm saying they're already ignored the electoral college means swing states relevant elections regardless population under florida high new hampshire low but texas republican wyoming california democrat vermont irrelevant presidential this suppresses voter turnout ballot every single one it's urban rural political leaning status quo roughly equivalent support matter provides tangible benefits disenfranchises well minority party members non state republicans democrats nebraska ask vote really matters presidential race that's crappy 
not fast there's question mark end signal author's intent ask in case appears statement exclamation rather 
elizabeth warren leads field new iowa poll 
you read pollster directly http www focusonruralamerica com july poll results warren lead followed harris biden sanders this best place race since started edit just add context points march her favorability whopping highest field far continuously rising the important thing shows weak frontrunner strong one means primary shaping like think it'll likely boil vs may temporarily buoyed overperformance south carolina lose california point probably drop expect last loses nh things looking good team 
nate silver issue biden harris warren seem jockey top spots depending poll first states placing tier group even though pick happy sinking we're probably looking nomination 
it's interesting joe biden lead started talk 
honestly worried several weeks ago hence rushed donate media narrative shifted post people forum steadily rose 
anyone else get delaney ad targeted towards article so strange anyways love news 
i'm bit sad bernie poorly time happy warren happier still see biden going 
iowa election caucus voter registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
am missing something harris getting attention sharp attacks debate 
yes see warren would well strong ground bit midwestern charm progressive iowa caucus goers tend dedicated given kind ordeal vote which certainly help nh she'll advantage along bernie this exciting as long improved fundraising status fantastic position 
harris's home state ca believe 
i'm rooting warren rule bernie buttigieg think biden continue tank pete seems natural go moderates given beto's decline like supporters picked based name recognition alone harris's debate bump fade time i'd say harris top tier booker tulsi could still improve rest done really thought castro would get the fact means campaign probably legs 
rule pete bernie know biden's voters go maybe pull hail mary pass save race relations south bend black support rally behind 
guess one important question picks bidens votes i'd imagine bulk go harris african american vote centrist best thing warren biden stick around long possible 
that prediction biden however afraid people eagerly writing underestimating power establishment desperation support centrist candidate 
that she the people forum huge though get talked enough 
i'm still wondering released numbers donated first time cycle nervous see made money 
thought funny quote attributed anyone 
can get it happening gif instead ron paul elizabeth warren dancing rainbow feather boa 
bernie hired wrong people campaign sirota within feet wants win 
that also people envisioning making fool trump debate stage not saying personally feel think refuse that's lot 
mean like policy increasing teacher salary funding poorer districts and cosponsored helpful bills senate one reducing black maternal mortality rate https www cbsnews com news kamala harris reintroduces bill reduce among women but think attention mostly due busing comment biden 
think know media loves drama she successfully launched attack damaged front runner contentious dramatic moment either debate they eat shit and outside alright but perspective typical manufactured performance expect politicians polished though thought warren gave better answers harris first night buttigieg second 
that also people envisioning making fool trump debate stage not saying personally feel think refuse that's lot 
she grew oklahoma knows real farming communities rural voters think harris ticket matter 
yep home state advantage fairly diluted nowadays warren overtaken polling 
think safely rule buttigieg see top tier hit double digits single poll candidates consistently 
buttigieg seems running vp his attacks debate tailor made go pence 
where pete get win though he needs iowa non factor far got puncher chance nh nv sc 
bernie clear ceiling among things look unfavorables zero way win democratic nomination convention floor save getting close enough give he also coalition builder primary built building buttigieg mayor town national political experience nor polls going right direction bigger names taking stage think either real shot if we're talking chances i'd put longshots booker castro klobuchar sanders unpopular opinion may 
highly doubt but i'm one black voter south 
haha way black support improves pete finally finishes investigation fires racist cop 
bulk votes come electability crowd warren take effort 
always mention friends tell watch they're already inclined support warren definitely noticed tonal shift event 
feeling low compared competitive candidates she focused fundraising intentionally freezing big donors bernie grassroots army hope enough avoid falling behind others ramp field operations 
probably would look bad delaney attributed quote 
faiz shakir supposed excellent campaign manager unfortunately i'd guess entire binder dedicated damage control whenever david sirota fucks twitter 
trump definitely debate he craves attention might whine try rig 
think liberals fantasies using aaron sorkin speeches dress republicans expose hypocrites really works share values 
i'm bit concerned warren would sharp debate harris composed calm first relatively tame terms anyone going 
while warren harris would awesome kinda want senate she asks great questions 
raised past quarter that's pretty insane 
i'm iowa think could win he's lot people's second third choice people drift main candidate tanks if pulls place takes nh prospects would change underdog sure rule tim ryan eric swalwell tier 
how non factor early lol iowa race whole tossup top candidates point thought otherwise swinging double digit points single debate crazy edit spelling 
called hail mary since almost chance happening 
that's good point know bulk i'm disputing saying i've looked nevertheless right warren capture portion fairly easily 
i'm hoping network comes thru she sizeable one senatorial campaign bigger taking photos calling back might help build recurring donors 
that's fear gave could i'm worried campaign get bled dry senate war chest goes away 
poorly executed cheap shots biden what whether agree strategy bringing biden's history race slightest they're literally reason touted winner debates surging polls plummeting looks terrible coming argue planned planning something make less genuine concern pretty clear meant saying even using score points especially highlighted real problem rather baiting 
traction blacks absolutely terrible latinos https www univision com news politics harris castro rise among hispanics first democratic debate you cannot win primary without decent amount african american latino voters pete unfortunately entirely media manufactured politician really good ideas though warren problems minorities increasing support 
no one going win indiana lol castro probably better vp pick beto 
gets exactly until he's polling minimum non factor 
only way see happening something major like remove entire board charged hiring firing police force platitudes work black folks needs actions words point but actions goes crafted image nice guy 
think win primary limited support long field remains highly divided as people drop and early primaries especially ca stay 
lol think understand non factor means by standards hillary presidential election 
agree i've seen similar issues current city enough done well 
something major like remove entire board charged hiring firing police force look racial discrimination shootings make blood boil much anyone really reasonable thing expect every mayor city time shooting happens 
the way see top four candidates cory booker die abducted aliens 
winning primary limited support almost guarantees poor showing general election 
diversifing police force highest priority ease tension city if board can't appoint there easy solution idea one many possible solutions words enough anymore mr pete seems offer 
words ever appeared anything small time mayor tiny population 
warren saved home illegal foreclosure bank lied tried steal housing crisis we able file complaint proof she created cfpb protect citizens 
honestly warren get enough credit creating cpfb it's one single important progressive accomplishments recent history and real world example govern president 
and trump mulvaney twisted around act corporate financial protection bureau 
the cfpb played huge role saving home 
i'm cpfb whistleblower suit right https drive google com open id lyeneekrpzrx feuyjrgbxjxicdoip 
people tried tell time obama biden responsible always point warren came whole thing first place 
i'm still disappointed state elect cfpb protege rich cordray governor like even hate big government read like minutes could think enormously beneficial agency everyday people ah answered question 
bernie fan work cfpb unmatched she bonafide superstar 
obligatory president lyndon johnson said if convince lowest white man he's better best colored notice picking pocket hell give somebody look he'll empty pockets it's sad sentiment still true 
warren statistically tied biden new poll 
vastly prefer warren harris hope sticks 
bernie guy predicting lose support race continues not people like policies see warren electable alternative she better debates clearer plans younger seems spry hang till end keep pushing party left throw behind time comes give edge biden harris 
don't get happy people time money still needed 
who people pulling biden this feels like hillary want one candidate another somehow constantly ahead everything maybe different washington state i'm seeing hearing actual interest anecdotally consensus amongst circles easiest way democrats lose election 
there's paywall anyone know poll referencing 
it's starting look like gonna warren vs harris 
this predebate poll wonder much shifted since 
love warren but old like bernie joe mean many problems outside time pass torch guy said invest next generation i'm probably still going vote liz meantime 
similar boat debates namely think warren better crossover appeal bible rust belt harris little grating californian say former rural appalachian hillbilly however finally saw people see debate ferocious justified take biden want fighter fighting spirit important edit guess said thing twice that still lean surpassed others though 
definitely prefer liz harris steep drop 
like harris possible attorney general even secretary state think would make good president though 
well warren progressive kamala harris everyone prefer 
incoming harris supporters correct opinion elizabethwarren places 
quality debates might go harris think better head matchup trump want live warren america president anymore so conflicted would like see focused candidates get trimmed 
hope really wanting bernie warren top two spots i'm afraid drop polls if one win happy hope either willing back time comes 
if happens throw social support warren get friends voting i'm vermoter love bernie but let's win primaries 
completely agree think best unifying party since appeal left moderates 
please tell remaining bernie friends and campaign cut conspiracy crap refresh message we need guys stick around long possible way tracking happen the anger playing well time made fun buttigieg outraised sanders quarter faiz shakir complained served parmesan encrusted salmon toothpick people pretty positive opinion he spoken liked rules advocated doing unforced error pete taken zero dollars super pacs propelled grassroots lgbtq donors needs start running reputable mainstream progressives working professionals left also get behind it telling last week instead preparing debate reach new voters ama 
i'm pretty positive warren nominated she'll chose bernie vp helps 
sometimes polls outliers nothing necessarily wrong poll unless happens pollster consistently warren support unusually high shows point drop biden towards harris every 
consensus iowa know people like biden they're blue dog types really union republicans basically around hear warren harris booker pete bernie 
biden well minorities people neither online much largest parts voter base old also ones consistently turn vote constantly put foot mouth would great candidate election standpoint 
just name recognition people heavily politics safer moderate warren sanders also vp obama he's vanilla candidate ends lot people's pick strong initial leaning probably change election season gets underway debates exposure candidates still he'll showing he's want return normalcy trump also corporate friendly going ruffle feathers old money donors dnc media same reason pop music keeps surviving safe easy listen ask much thought listener 
this feels like hillary people want one candidate another somehow constantly ahead everything because wanted clinton right biden doesn't mean can't persuaded denying existence thus failing address concerns way go 
heard much va either know people excited warren came around 
he may hillary context around election much different time comparison really matter trump never considered serious threat running clinton motivate people go vote sure might biden but think voting office biggest motivator regardless democratic candidate every smells blood water pool comically large 
he's well know safe establishment candidate it's already happening think he'll continue drop polls primary season goes candidates get recognition 
this feels like hillary people want one candidate another somehow constantly ahead everything twitter real life primary million votes please dismissive calling us

really get sentiment harris fighter warren appealing emotion showed biden wrongdoing this take https youtu ayvr qcn em 
she doubt great debater thought pretty obvious came debate take biden locked loaded 
that's interesting while thought harris' confrontation biden necessary expose weaknesses many voters ignoring ignorant actually much substance how calling year old policy 'put food table tax credit reminding people putting children cages bad seems like pretty weak platform not mention record prosecuter screams 'opportunist' whereas warren fighting causes political office decades https www nytimes com opinion kamala harris criminal justice html

really like positions much harris looks president she might make trump cry 
i've donated two candidates liz pete harris steep drop vs 
feel like sanders number two i'm confused people say harris warren nearly identical policy compared differences biden think would horrible president doubt able save country many ways could in interest educating prefer 
not harris progressive genuinely horrible record prosecutor ag here's article democracy now https www democracynow org kamala harris 
eh vote believe primary blue race if harris wins i'll definitely think warren may able actually save country 
its kind crazy fast bernies star fallen offense honestly thought would least hang final three he's already hemoraging support harris warren 
they pledged would proven true word 
oh sure got animosity either dem candidates exceptions we need oust cheese puff wish could help canadian maybe change citizenship russian interfere election complete impunity 
think would pick someone traditional left balance ticket unify party much possible

the feel get bernie way name recognition biden largely forgettable vp but likely west coast speaking my wife still forgets obama's 
did want hillary though in state seemed interest no bumper stickers signs facebook propaganda tv ads nothing it trump bernie really odd us nominee many talking conspiracy and we're strong blue many people close vote despite staunch democrats that's that even we're old money there's 
thank trying looks like linking back another wapo story 
lol oops redditing work conducive thorough redditor 
lol yeah trolling failing not good look 
lol i'm bot ok just guy likes sports progressiveism and someone else pointed failing troll conservative sub 
everyone thinks he's professional pundit pundits predictors wrong it unwise 'settle' someone due likely poor punditry terms settle based upon bad analysis this say room strategy use rarely possible great care 
speaking someone former beto supporter thought others would like you really no clue people going end liking so go truly 
it also amplifies effect negative traits like sexism racism if i'm sexist racist make choices worried sexists racists would think preferences represented way proportion actual numbers we already method incorporate biases voters primary need add another layer top 
i've voted good consider pretty informed issues this certainly passion mine judgement must somewhat strategic voting politics pragmatism compromise oftentimes try best empathize type person less likely vote nevertheless potential voter say keep strategy primaries whoever dems nominate batch candidates leagues trump joe probably least favorite top tier still lest give power 
oh yes love video i'm really comparing harris warren put way believe maybe pointed sometimes prosecutor make feel little chair like teacher professor and moreover sanders proven depth commitment years that's big advantage eyes 
these people experts scamming getting away he probably much plausible deniability consider taken 
surprised backlash racist that part seemed dirty the rest excellent though emotion substance combo 
well point debate she prepared points wants make it obvious that good thing warren great really like engaging informative debates 
how calling biden year old policy she asked regretted today's hindsight said instead made state's rights argument think that's relevant voter's understand 
think that's pretty good assessment 
right i'm kind disappointed seems dropping everyone saying expand base know there's time left still hope something 
wapo abc reuters ipsos today nd place gaining debates his star faded media want make sure take biden's top 
hope the traditional left centrist bullshit plagued democrats decades caused us lose multiple elections handed political power corporations wealthy elite they reason donald trump go 
it bad idea one agrees lol 
think big factor difference percentages number candidates hillary running people four others race two ever real contenders 
bernie virtually unknown prior biden run president served vp years 
young white people statistically represented social platforms like reddit i'm saying literally old minorities 
did want hillary though million predominantly states without caucuses yes 
honestly trump bernie people absolutely brutal hillary primaries i'm surprised supporters feel comfortable voicing opinion would constantly attacked if preferred candidate winning showing support brings angry even bother saying anything 
that extremely anecdotal likely function people associate 
think relevant said comment my point lead pragmatic policy discussion like needed focus earlier night 'food fight' it purely attack benefitted campaign 
are obama bill clinton traditional left 
agree traditional voters gone yet so stuck transitional moment if helps us win okay vp really much power beyond give anyway 
you sound salty offering suggestion no need nasty guess asking much reddit 
maybe that's it odd election cycle in elections gore kerry obama massive representation along republican counterparts then comes hillary literally nowhere found felt 
that would said anecdotally original post this also posing questions gauge people outside anecdotal circles experienced thing 
it experience no one thought going say little girl bussed personal telling biden character apologize still stands states rights harris made great point warren first night second an issue might important personally well relevant communities she focus multitude issues stick talking put food table addresses multiple good they smart candidates discussions impacting different 
how paranoia it's poll showing second place the real star fading biden matter time drops single digits 
it'd consistent interests they want harris biden particularly terrified word socialism warren sanders support ending private primary health insurance trillion industry literally trillions stake people cnn msnbc 
obama less yes get new road lend hand times changing 
they influence disagree moving toward center help us win we simply need use right language majority americans fully board called leftist policies bernie espousing

pretty heavily pete boat warren captured attention absolutely pick wins nom person want vp bottom list risen quickly 
joe biden spineless coward sees cowardice virtue worst part 
i'm definitely voting biden given chance to seems like candidate either side that's even close aligned views policy general granted never trump many democratic candidates gone bonkers far left sure choice i'd besides 
love pete bernie good ideas biden dinosaur weak non existent he us needs move forward improve 
yep when says fight means use every power say hey let's sit bipartisanship the republicans want minority majority government permanent it's working anyone get wants reminisce good old orrin hatch needs way 
mainstream media complying giving coverage 
which means they'll fight death shoehorn honestly worst second options 
warren needs go directly biden debates bernie simply cannot get away would make look bad generate sympathy given certain historical context hand come stronger proving ability take trump 
the crazy thing obama seems beto supporter met shortly announce hiring old campaign staffers thought sure biden year two time presidential loser run 
i'm leaning warren bernie right either way progressive candidate big lead candidates primaries believe fall line behind otherwise progressives split vote biden guaranteed win primary huge improvement democracy threat donald given potential democratic would shame get one general election 
yeah top two warren pete the i'd sad see win nomination though would biden gabbard everyone else happy vote trump sigh 
he worse takes bank money 
just curious which policies warren far left 
just remember lot real people afraid you convince biden also safe option 
would anything warren buttigieg ticket 
na all need attack biden he dangerously bad government right edit agree warren needs savage get debates want people scared reference topics keeping corner eyes like fucking dragon waiting pounce stupidity which likely 
yes they chose truman wallace clinton bernie recently debate topic ignorant west virginia party country times legal obligation cheat the dnc no requirement let us choose anything this established court if want warren win need assert fucking take bullshit 
can't imagine obama crazy biden running around telling everyone republicans going epiphany willing work democrats trump seems kind fucked considering 
know people think biden obama must super close friends honestly sure would case 
i'm subbed sub pete's bernie's reddit if primary held today i'd vote warren would happy three frankly rest democrat candidates for policy like best followed bernie know regards pete since set yet electability focused likely turn voters well they'll get trump supporters think might edge election perhaps publicity debates change even though biden high list older white democrats really black people due affiliation obama among reasons younger probably much outweighed turning climate important issue facing us electing help enough prevent disaster main reason he's pretty far although matter who's elected give controlled senate able count obstruction republicans may there's deal good personal relations dead wrong the changed lot last representing delaware republican senators wanted led bill they'd primaried next voted they care self preservation anything else 
this sure also vote biden general gets 
i'm total bernie guy really like warren personally hope primaries continue two senators unify work together take biden if they're totally possible ofc i'd prefer top ticket happy liz th president 
pete might concrete policies calming measured reassuring demeanor much way obama he also undeniably intelligent like military experience kind imo least light prerequisite person ultimately charge armed forces infant trump office really hammered home being president great they face country need able broker agreements parties government well countries think would regard maybe best candidates personally warren perfect complements far candidate clearest idea needs realistically achieve charisma personally feel want combination two executive branch 
policies aside agree priorities outside chelsea manning think need time he talks generational change winning era youthful charismatic voice could really shape talking that short summary 
biden democratic candidate guaranteed lose trump 
she would need running mate balance foreign policy or preferably could beef statements that primary hesitation believe come great measured positions want see 
that happened donald trump but also howard dean it hard say way gang would end 
the dnc choose hillary primary voters overwhelmingly sorry let's litigate particularly we're going make stuff 
wish would enjoy retirement great career please biden let go 
goddamn he sucks here threequel joe 
in retrospect seems like biden obama pawn candidacy hugely controversial black muslim name he chose conservative white male democratic candidate balance ticket 
my biggest concern changing system like warren get money politics make voting responsive people give workers power then able best everything else think that's controversial either pursued regardless priorities 
i'm little pessimistic unfortunately think stay race happens cannibalize eachother this one huge problems first past post voting reform top priorities people 
the best president lifetime zero military experience factor also understand pete charismatic take comes he utterly milquetoast bland beyond compare running least gets weird unearned boost remarkably young get warren old bit reserved specific vision party america inspiring hip millennial 
sure would call charismatic https youtu xj dmxzfx he inexperienced even held state office south bend th largest city indiana seems like talks big game warren policies blow water based generational change nothing empower millennials and biggest problem see beating trump candidate get behind 
well say guaranteed fucking coin toss 
said hillary caucuses i'll say biden you want trump this get 
like said convince people already agree 
only candidate can't see inslee hickenlooper de blasio swalwell castro delaney getting far 
obviously it'll hinge releasing proper policy naval intelligence officer seven years that's pretty damn firm foundation understanding rest world 
with trump worked republicans old wind bags full shit everyone knew he went said guys crooks ate that work way when progressives throw gauntlet biden nothing return challenge bunch vapid platitudes not well voter pays attention 
blue ridge mountains shenandoah river 
for real though if think right go check dnc primaries wiki tell many counties clinton then state do discuss opinions 
also changing system control levers effectively imagine divided government current republican party it's fighting republicans bad faith compromise someone willing fight reactionary go beyond denouncing actions actually use power presidency who set plan maneuver within faced stonewalling warren literally created federal agency best consistent oversight senator bernie pete simply clue respectively executive branch better lives americans 
if either worth salt they'll work together beat biden the future progressive movement depends whoever bernie warren leading new hampshire nevada entire working 
just cause curious best lifetime 
how see warren beating trump and actually would say pete experience needed office managed whole city deal ins outs managing people perfect vp head senate 
even able win he'll directly appealing centrist independents moderate republicans means bad things seeing happening trump continue unabated 
agreed it would also mean debate pence love see 
gp i'll add bit when candidates went howard dean media part attack in joe biden situation would mostly take side 
understand many people look vote tallies think there's somehow conspiracy afoot bernie even democrat rubs lot wrong way oh wait do one main russian operations convince bunch hillary you've fallen propaganda friend don't worry late get reacquainted reality 
yes warren absolutely beat trump policies rock solid practical appeal majority americans even base south bend particularly impressive city it college town state capitol of indiana he wannabe obama none strengths hard pass 
vp worst position warren stay senate nominee 
agree they already that's must savagely loud i'm letting every mother fucker know wrong pissed but yeah the media side that's new what walk army progressive people years ago felt alone now inevitable 
oooo taking extra scoop 'party country' tell 
y'all gonna hate last president could even considered decent lyndon johnson in fact one absolute best that's horrific vietnam war and since i'm loving another crazy idea preferred hillary clinton barack obama 
you come debate came say right 
no i'm taking secret conspiracy bernie sanders predictably large group democrats cotton dragged primary benefited russian interference would helpful replicate model include parroting propaganda dnc see 
ooh true progressive true come bro get fuck fucking purity troll nonsense do whatever want wholeheartedly support democrat drop act admit happy watch rest country burn 
you missing forest trees go ahead wallow ignorance verified but attack comment like your one unwilling look proof acknowledge i'm right argument works mine so muddy end day what said accurate 
you came first literally attacked stance then proved wrong views started talk everything else good job 
you prove anything seem learned goodbye 
biden endorses liz's bankruptcy plan reminded get nomination affect change country 
aside good endorsing one warren policies sign able achieve legislative accomplishments senate doubt dems win majority biden going bills law 
mixed feelings glad team joe's smart enough know wonder warren plan wants rub magic campaign pomade tbh ask pretend you're good professor never happened either joe america's basically picked nom i'm going help twitler hostile foreign powers divide conquer put money mouth hash settles feel 
reminder women work men takes prize puns 
the fact elect president entire executive branch dozens appointments judges cabinet heads some surely warrenites we're team 
probably one cynical enough think biden endorsement honest commitment implement plan elected no doubt cave pressure banking industry 
halfhearted endorsement bill certainly come vote change 
that's want see not lip service position real power women poc administration 
ask pretend you're good professor never happened either interpreted moment kind hearing panel bankruptcy reform compliment was underlying message missed 
thank biden like trump useless figurehead oval office the job care electing steven miller jared kushner faceless policy writers influencers drawing slapping president's desk sign bidens personal opinions matter hes getting brief signing matters details if warren potus she'd reading entire thing proposing changes owns doubt that's fine give warrenite slots nearly good edit 
history shows exactly we cannot celebrate unless takes responsibility impacts policy caused 
in title believe either effect affect works and since article written biden centric thinking closely matches intent someone correct understanding if see liz one responsible change presumptive nominee ultimately causing elected policy

spokeswoman warren campaign says warren's one man woman response last night's cnn town hall amassed million views hours accounting places posted 
she kinda good whole running president thing 
contrast trump response not style substance believe numbers even close race clearly heads shoulders every measure 
man man witz the see warren speak engaged fully committed yet day getting closer 
i'm sure many like warren grew methodist familiar current issues church it refreshing speak much favor support people want live damn lives without someone using faith lucky open minded loving role models within church in experience used negative done cowardly manner they never prejudice vote silence the youth rejected official stances umc level even hope maybe kick general assembly ass clergy god's sake ruin two generations otherwise just another reason see sen nations ethical leader 
barometer comparison really good fan made ad bernie sanders media's coverage incredibly disconnected actually took twitter storm week two back got something ballpark million views hours sextupled amount shorter timeframe 
missed town hall say please 
warren number choice since announced running president on top platform unbelievably charismatic 
think reason upsetting people final statement the condemnation homophobia fine jab assuming find one hits sore spot in context warren aiming solely homophobes great but human brains process information purely logically that last subconscious fear growing proportion population rate never married individuals record high and men least higher women this completely decoupled also source negative reaction nothing wrong she merely exposed another issue troubling americans today it would hear acknowledge decline marriage even simple tying existing plans help example plan early childhood programs citing low could tie unmarried cite financial concerns barrier show care contribute making raising family less economic burden

question thank let's say campaign trail approached warren and supporter approaches says senator old fashioned faith teaches marriage one man woman what response well i'm going assume guy said marry cool assuming find 
she seemed imply men opposed gay marriage probably trouble finding wife it's gaffe level basket deplorables think could come back haunt general 
think right she landed good line delivered well people last bit alone attacking whether they're homophobic this still early likely forgotten outside foxnewsosphere definitely hammer point need mix she's going outlaw hamburgers car however i'm glad see loosening know ear telling that's weak seen stiff dork etc keeps positivity message reach may offended today 
she give serious follow people talk first part cnn cut clip you watch op's link 
very different standards male female politicians correct way seem think pretty funny 
she said she'd assume guy asked yeah thus marry one woman it presuming sexist view saying if going say marriage man then that's took 
she's implying men likely homophobic sex marriage really needed establish gender hypothetical response land it would worked way around well assume established man simply guy asking you gotta dig pretty hard get sexism 
you mean standards allow men assault prey women elected office 
lot vocal anti gay marriage people male preacher politicians like pence think dog men 
think saying could say marry woman acknowledging assuming guy looks like warren implying tell single at first reaction pretty ambiguous meant guys less likely support lgbt rights 
thought odd well i've never heard sexist divide issue take offense male supporter marriage 
fyi you need add comment joking reddit especially political subreddits it stands sarcasm there context verbal speech know 
eh others care lies like idea trump hurting people absolute scum 
completely agree statement great thing warren never makes feel late party 
you see timing delivery damn near perfect 
lol uh sure making fun homophobes real issue assholes guess she'll lose asshole vote

she persisted reading relevant letter coretta scott king backing moment hoping gain conversation warren subreddit are trying understand support convince us we're wrong

also person asking question guy 
from linked article today women men support sex marriage difference hardly big enough gap assume anything even consider less 
that's fair point but potential president work states she could easily said well man marry woman or vice versa the way stated taken men ones think which dangerous tone especially female candidate 
okay well reddit enjoy karma

difference hardly big enough gap assume anything even consider less like can't actually deny there's selectively interpret meaningful record extremely broad math based numbers suggest ballpark sixteen million women men supporting sex marriages would say that's pretty significant 
especially female candidate that's dangerous tone right if run around looking things offend us likely succeed

if may completely honest think tons democrats love warren really want give trump another woman run it's fair right part story unfortunately many people see worst dangerous president ever sure feel allowing first candidate history opposed times 
that could said candidate literally ever lmao 
i've thinking recently really disagree hillary perfect candidate immune valid criticism but way reacted downsides utterly unacceptable issues read male candidates would understood justified critiqued reasonable outright ignored like ahem rape essays absolutely due femaleness the fact persona non grata party worked decades help build including fundraising many ballot dems dared run president abborant 
to honest theres something said mature campaign it's uphill battle first time presidential candidates 
lot people talked prior new hampshire primary ultimately chose amy klobuchar no insult intended senator torn two share title gender clearly paying attention debates 
you forgot binder throwing salad eating comb lady 
this wrong way look things it matter woman running old white guys what matters great policy proposals opinion second best generate turn people stop viewing politics identity lens politicians talking personal journey start fucking plans policies give fuck gay served army pete planning country point generator 
yeah man know said disrespect jews i'm still feeling don't get wrong i've come sanders playing stereotypical old brooklyn jew shtick signalling jewishness problem saying okay warren deals sexism maybe jews disagree think anti semitic and pete attacked lot gay lets pretend he's given pass completely overall agree white male privilege reason campaign chance 
think warren electable play devils advocate position semi reasonable everyone completely aware white male privilege thing people making statement particularly useful interesting electability country vote evidence suggests might willing woman better choice electorally you seem missing entire discussion electability clinton lose least part sex moreover personally agree issue whole idea anyone right president absurd the failure candidate kick racism sexism presidential candidates random dudes unnuanced misses large subtleties say exist applying moral force race poor politics great ethics sometimes hear pro mostly family complain things like women apologizing democratic debate asked gift apology claim driven social pressure miss legitimately make us twice electing female though frankly somewhat questionable political instincts happens every 
since talking electability terms demographics want point female vs jewish socialist homosexual the truth none going lend advantage trump prejudice christians exist sides aisle female far least offensive three 
where sticker link want one 
torn two people share title gender clearly paying attention debates honestly means like worker bees get shit done i'd argue warren work progressive programs make america better klobuchar reinforces status quo pre trump either candidate someone looking past jan actually president vs beating 
i'm warren since may amy second choice going promote go detail suffice say title gender it's presumptive problematic assume anyone supports two women 
mean running someone amazingly dynamic like obama maybe could see folks competition and let's even get started god emperor cheese puff side aisle given facts supposed think white male privilege myth lol makes sense two choices fell person talked electable tv msnbc cnn npr stopped talking warren post iowa 
on purpose considered electable either 
yes personal experience helps voters understand candidates make decisions may outlined policy proposals eg handling natural disasters for example one reasons dig liz know academic study problem seek expert advice choose smartest course action 
bernie supporters always blind sexism male privilege because directly benefit exist another casualty loyalty man rather ideal 
my point pretty clear you group including traditionally marginalized groups long man then electable go build strawman elsewhere 
yeah realize lot people notice sexism or care 
democratic socialist bernie actual understanding 
think guy means demographics trump preyed upon victimized women life he way dismissing brainwashed watching 
yeah whole point woman would opponent demographic twice row trump run jewish man last time homosexual ran less warren people afraid twice

wish presumptive literally told case people 
it pretty presumptive though happens time people go assumption easily early 
not ideology understand but point need dig policy otherwise might well voting who's wearing best tie actually elected official 
strongly disagree you making huge generalization academics ascribing characteristics might liz posses attributes think academic would argue lot smartest person world listen advice again story matter candidate stands 
let give pro warren rule friendly translation want say dealing words unintended consequences taking responsibility part love it's refreshing see candidate acknowledge things without getting defensive angry she warm person overabundance empathy can't believe touch anyone hears speak vast majority people different kind attitude support progressive social media instead no strawman i'm directly calling mean nobody needed bring jews relation warrens electability we nothing jewish get electable fuck yeah women world would better loving place live hating sanders bloomberg enough baggage even popped head concerns specifically preempt said know well anti semite disrespectful 
what behind warren the entire point electability argument concern people sexist vote woman think unreasonable pointing women politics careful say held higher standard 
well least electability point people like dad democrat understand difference 
know said i'm responding torn two people share title gender clearly paying attention debates i've watched every single debate like candidates not everyone chooses reasons 
that makes sense mean make assumptions academics mostly wanted explain personal candidate details help us fill gaps speak may policy proposals and qualities mentioned pertaining liz fit better understood vis candidates instead belonging scholars sorry clear 
you choosing disrespectful just bringing whether voters use anymore anti semite people bring gender have met america tens millions us awful hateful my point always every single category marginalized acceptable considered electable country woman hell left even admit sexism exists usually launching diatribe possible reason anyone would support warren identity politics they bad racists sexists right see women poc assume go hired race sick tired effing ignored and say color knows full well racism feels like go build strawman elsewhere 
it definitely optics problem he rebrand fdr new deal politician instead 
absolutely as another redditor said senators looking past election towards actually governing laudable goal 
yeah elizabeth warren different but that's we're 
think leave jews alone strawman mean 
yeah think sanders lesser extent warren miss point say progressive policies popular they democrats image problem couched name progressivism democratic socialism people vote 
continue purposely ignore actual words feel aggrieved the good news successfully distracted sexist argument mission accomplished let's talk men and never ever speak sexism makes uncomfortable random men's comfort takes precedence times 
see problem progressive label that it socialist word negative connotations make parents think communism 
you play suffering olympics elsewhere stop anti semite 
sexism suffering olympics simply pointing candidate jewish anti semitism up the irony 
in shift warren says she forgo big money events nominated 
as bernie supporter warren kind feel pretty blatant move say hey guy drops got home hear concerns corruption big money influence take seriously you've bernie's back he's unequivocally so also hey wanna switch sides that's cool already lock genuinely excites i'm fan moves made tells listening it also surprise there's calls sanders last week behind long thinks anything closes admittedly tiny given rest democratic field gap absolute win book this like half hearted hollow gesture not warren's history 
this play bernie voters her fundraising stance going general one common criticisms warren leveled thus far by stating publicly day says campaign change heart attack clearly means seriously doubt anything financially cut rest party knees making line positions wide swath policy they also group gave largest totals combining bernie's efforts would huge primary his nice camp well continues impress hell 
fantastic news corporations wealthy individuals business influencing politicians donations good see warren stand beliefs the people country capable funding democratic candidate grassroots begging corporate elite something ever ban dnc next step let's get toxic influence party 
think goal along she needed build donor list order know viable option 
honestly mixed feelings guess grassroots fundraiser la bernie model might work we're looking billion dollar campaign it's big risk but current fundraising knows edit she's saying pac money either https twitter com ewarren status that seem like clear mistake going cause endless nitpicking anytime working union ideological group 
yes this exactly hoping would happen 
one best decisions hope follows thru 
can someone clarify understand correctly this means actively seek big contributions rich individuals limit so still donate pandering 
can't help remember person money lost last go round think long campaign enough field infrastructure ground racking wads cash less important even selfie lines make look like people's candidate yay free media plus big events bad news deplorable both donor the pressure say something script insiders makes likely put one's foot mouth probably trump allow cell phones bashes 
matthew yglesias tweeted https twitter com mattyglesias status the problem every time warren second third degree interaction donor reported hypocrisy story trump continues collect bribes hotels daily basis reaction and frankly i'm concerned on one hand choice strengthens sharpens anti corruption campaign exactly right sort run sets standard high taught us anything public feeling sours faster someone appears fall short standards proudly drops ground high risk reward 
she sanders already raising biden without big fundraisers primary if one takes nom need small donors keep momentum and clinton raised trump still lost money helps get people vote give another though show continued support 
as bernie warren supporter feel comfortable supporting candidate takes big dollar donations this step right direction without doubt the next dem nominee needs one grassroots power lose moral high ground risk i'd rather take 
this ballsy good means going contribute win thing 
let's clear dnc gladly take money warren attending events 
yes this one big concerns i'm glad hear 
look feel warren backing says completely avoiding notion puppet absolutely valid decision if rising say take turn would cast doubt 
given grassroots funding bernie able clear far campaign maybe whomever needed convinced warren forgoing big money actually work maybe corruption news last weeks also made imperative run least beholden 
sorry think terrible idea large donations automatically represent corporate agenda like pac contributions warren exercise discretion attends events setting ambitious small donation total goals worry gets nomination she'll fundraising disadvantage 
is shift i'm pretty sure consistent host big money fundraisers refuse donations freely given 
is shift never actually stated position one way that's 'taking 
nothing politics attempts post denied reason 
people downvote huge mistake it's raising money presidential race also congressional races elect democrats going enact warren's agenda this get wiped elections sans obsessed wonder states like wisconsin michigan north carolina gerrymandered favour republicans incredibly shortsighted naive feels pandering voters need reach liberal activists 
good doing otherwise would massively undercut arguments lobbying big money politics etc know make many people nervous shit change point and voting gonna 
warren supporter not worried taking money corps jumping ship middle class trust this non issue i'd feel way sanders 
know sticking point amongst bernie fans wished she'd change mind claiming made fundamentally corrupt whatever the optimist thinks well wanted logically like right but realist nope busters find something new smear always 
ugh the reality viable general election campaign fucking expensive you fix problem undue influence money politics getting elected passing legislation unilaterally disarming get first place win fight already create want 
this fine she's going plenty money creepy dark groups somewhat less shady super pacs want still she can't work stop kind next four years took get elected 
on one hand glad hear unilaterally disarming made sense considering this going tough doubt 
another thing someone pointed looking back past cycles gaffes stuck candidates longest obama's bitterly clinging guns religion comment romney's lower earners worthless mooches hillary's basket deplorables said private fundraisers rich donors while see warren making sort mistake even that's still risk mitigated 
feel like need little help simple saying corporate money this means warren campaign hold closed door fundraisers accept pac lobbyist donations distinct individual people work company right however still includes fundraising dnc week long open fossil fuel donors guest list understanding my point comes makes really frustrating knock candidate could mean one things it easier move goalposts around claim corrupted hell even warren's last senate took non mostly organizations emily's list pretty sure got actual am base think pledge great issue gotten twisted past months pretty meaningless 
good maybe get bots shaddap dumb argument warren 
torn echo sentiment could prove unwise general liz often right things ought trust want billion dollar elections last years maybe needs show us possible another way principles worth amount money 
good think pretty obvious point money win elections people sick tired corporate influence if factor decide election trump going but works 
think previous position make sense glad the fuck big bankers candidate cannot cozying billionaires point 
can't say think good idea honestly 
honestly think misstep want win absolute purity 
need hear strategy behind want believe it'll work see plan 
does anyone data campaign's fundraising comes big money events i'd love know obama's campaign especially since thrived sort grassroots donations warren grab also held the going go somewhere whether holds more likely it'll if ballot either way think fine move smart one 
so taking big money nominee what threshold amount going forward can make dnc events cap individual donors maxed general organizations like nnu moveon org new democrat coalition super pacs contribute allowed any insight would greatly appreciated mixed feelings think everyone eventually board work twice hard president warren 
yay guess honestly one least important things list care gets money long going say makes stop putting children concentration camps 
disagree choice agree matt yglesias https twitter com mattyglesias status 
iowa election caucus voter registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
can ask general question everyone sub read plz answer sincerely love lady america needs right side lockstep bernie policies others better takes approach incorporating capitalism kind soft socialism know would appreciate society its early say take sanders vp choice someone else similar like hakeem jefferies abrams 
this really idiotic move you need raise lot money beat republicans wish dems act foolish comes raising cash 
if bad optics politicians rich donors meet private away public mean warren longer going dnc fundraiser 
my concern legitimately understand people upset taking corporate money general responding pressure edit typo 
the key word events she still take big money it's step right direction come believe message grassroots swear corrupting influence tired push politicians thing donors want wrong just cut cord put opioid killing party 
okay first getting board big money bernie yang well but corrected actually events really change policy pr spin taking donations care 
so seem like pandering anyone 
no big money events checks is real difference 
wonder appearances colbert anything announcement 
this play bernie voters yes i'd say much likely campaign simply expect quite volume grassroots support getting they made safe assumption would non viable general completely reasonable they've since done math realized lolfuckit 
think knows big money donor wants help donate pac hands clean raise enough small mid dollar run solid ground game pointed ad spending 
i'm bernie supporter finding torn liz lately so let say announcement really lot quell doubts i've she's easy second choice person starting realize mainstream liberal types hate like ppp people love obviously might compromise candidate two sides want fight us strongly behind someone it sure biden move fairly 
what change bernie campaign announced 
they also group gave bernie largest fundraising totals combining bernie's efforts would huge primary his voters nice camp well does anyone figures many people donating warren my wife like slightly split main candidate backup contribute campaigns almost equally gut says unusual regard curious see exactly breaks 
yup exactly see it also makes look timing recent events go hmmmm could way left field gut feeling 
it's smart maybe bernie drop based health liz surging also friends definitely means he'll pushing nomination likely one depending upon timing 
her play bernie voters transparent people know big money corrupting whether comes event mailbox sanders voter warming warren attempt trick people disheartening trust someone clearly trying fool 
honestly mixed feelings guess grassroots fundraiser la bernie model might work we're looking billion dollar campaign it's big risk but current fundraising knows thought thing first going serious behind whatever dnc candidate nominated whether want warren's say fund raisers blunders super pacs etc 
big bernie supporter donated last primary several times this year holding donations whoever comes hope sanders warren literally anyone running getting like move it resonate lot people 
conversely sanders' supporter makes much comfortable candidacy 
think mistake context i'm bernie supporter going throw support behind democratic nominee regardless this makes warren gets nomination enthusiastically also many donors currently supporting candidates and non all become election may take pac money directly betting liberal progressive pacs running anti trump pence ads general 
thinking thing thread convinced right move https twitter com jbarro status 
if people would donated max campaign standard fundraiser willing provided intimate closed door access patriots they problem no quid pro quo get selfie line like everyone else but believe want help warren still donate one stopping change get promise candidates many ones expect money give increased influence politics country em the entitlement superiority larger assets feel owed cancer just look zuckerberg comments actions especially lately disgusting edit really directed comment went bit rant started typing please take personally 
that means heavily dependent getting people enthused amped enough donate bernie warren pretty much two imagine pulling find biden charismatic candidates that's risky could pay big keep control media cycles really see using boost general give lot credence idea fighting middle class 
money presidential campaigns really matter long enough run real campaign course warren trouble fundraising think move start taking bernie's support well 
mixed feelings her moral clarity makes easier win general 
that seem like clear mistake think demonstrates shes going votes money treating really admirable it's well shutting clinton comparisons also pretty innocuous way potentially siphon sanders supporters 
maybe time end billion dollar campaign 
this probably based solid data campaign tells democrats want give whether get meet fundraiser also statement rule headlining fundraisers dnc could bring per event would effectively available 
while correct bernie still managed raise money it work 
worried pac money the democratic pacs going regardless says 
yeah get messaging needs people feel like going go back want lose bernie crowd insists money evil and look framing believe sanders need change so think wins that's positive aspect gone this feels tactical error give room criticize hopefully good plan spent guess everything would directly goes dnc instead ballot spending net result still that hopefully win make last election means speech 
believe they still donate want like anybody else actively sought catered 
that's okay ultimately right thing 
it tackles criticism bernie supporters said if instinct drop polls even health reasons overcomes one objection sure percentage swayed but probably group never going support anyway works people fence coming liz could significant 
it make lot comfortable supporting enthusiastically gets nom i'm still planning voting bernie matter dem general think making right move 
nope next she's supporting medicare hard enough read minds took dirty corporate money even though mostly retirees universities senate race transferred edit guess needed 
woman second tweet the problem every time warren third degree interaction donor reported hypocrisy story likely happen sexism 
let preface saying ultimately love obama followed similar model one describing he small donations primary went fairly hog wild general took ton money wall st then passed tarp bailed banks let thousands people lose homes warren fought direct assistance homeowners obama's economic team folks fold it precisely much beholden avoid 
i'm also scared but anti corruption brand so set clear contrast and betting raising way money anticipated confident they'll enough compete also mean dnc can't hold big fundraisers 
think would struggle sell anti corruption message things corrupt politicians though even careful coming fundraisers still bad look entire point campaign eliminate make government work actual people rather rich powerful she walk something criticized this also going get lot bernie supporters side nomination need big time general it definitely possible grassroots movement long involved energized help bring energy 
she refusing large donations events meets donors behind closed doors if executives donate campaign say money giving special access 
clinton outraised trump huge amount last time around still lost besides warren much better raising money grassroots easily make real people country instead wealthy elite 
bernie shown fundraising everything rather candidate corporate shill one win sellout 
it primary previously stated general either 
agree think we're estimating much people willing donate and underestimating type organization trump's team putting together time it's going slapped rnc proping legit ground game strategy 
it's already there's post article comments 
from article the campaign said would ensure state national parties resources need nominated ms warren headlined democratic national committee event august meet privately large donors attended she scheduled another upcoming she's still willing help raise money dnc ballot candidates going hold donor fundraisers 
big money donors still donate dccc etc 
the electoral college needs go warren wants abolish 
honestly senate even worse ec regard why wyoming rhode island get number votes california texas like aggregate effect smallest whitest states country outsized influence process make lean right americans would actually elect represented proportionally 
doubt we'll ever get rid ec without army progressives start changing state level electoral votes allocated but i'm glad warren talking 
good my vote count regardless whether live florida california iowa montana 
also hillary clinton actually million votes fact pundits sometimes want forget 
for everyone may aware electors arrives based representatives us senators dc what's frustrating electoral college number complete bullshit yes house largely representative population one agree capping representatives there would increase votes state even the addition senators absurd this really throws whack each gets two whether deserve plus wyoming arbitrary law allowing never lowest 
the electoral college completely indefensible almost every american institution hell bent contorting democracy 
god topic frustrating let's dispel myths the electoral college rural vs urban equally important big borders this benefits small new england states disadvantaging like texas in addition low population density mean for example nevada th lowest live cities rd highest country because two factors percentage citizens essentially correlation voting power citizen gets california york determine election results first florida larger populations second us rest far say majority politics bad when end choice cannot split case president letting majority choose better minority you really mental gymnastics come conclusion telling having said opposed considering making executive controlled board rather single person most republicans trying gain advantage cost democracy some people opinion getting upset opinions popular 
she's really tuned people sort circles want see politics electoral college term limits education reform healthcare banking regulations gun control know demographic would worldview tend run left leaning ways getting little bit exhausted pc culture war stuff like hammering side things much also seeing foreign policy is weak area missing 
i'm glad running this way reforms become permanent 
are states use mini electoral college vote governor like award electors per county something 
changing first past post voting rank order single transferable system way impact all aspects electorate party changing ec ever 
california election primary voter pre registration deadline http registertovote ca gov february www sos elections voter registration vote mail apply march general november 
how certainly valuable educational discussion related campaign does president role abolishing ec is motivating progressives triggering older conservative voters 
there truly something called 'tyranny majority but modern times interconnected technology hyper public perfect profiles think anyone profile might likely compete good so although historically pure democracy maybe could democratic election electoral college what kind bothers obvious political talking points elizabeth warren using she seems aware says pander academic saying believes way would want say hope uses gather secure base amazing power already 
funny thing political point might make sense going happen election opening constitutional convention change road recipe kind disaster getting emails we're states away right wing driven move hold meanwhile last time looked bernie sanders well electoral math compared pretty much every democratic candidate 
frankly think horrible idea getting rid electoral college essentially disenfranchises high density urban areas it sure would better democrats actually ran candidates address lower rural rather treating flyover country of course also good thing got gerrymandering control 
we've argument since drafting constitution never would ratified without connecticut compromise let's go our country polarized enough already we're going get states adopt npvic effect never mind issue populous vs less benefits democrats republicans even stay long nullify soon could this unwinnable fight waste time wish people put effort toward achievable goal instead like interstate compact rid winner takes 
the problem senate power increased far every supposed longer serves original purpose senator really represent state's interests anymore 
taking basic us history class would give answer the connecticut compromise also known great sherman agreement large small states reached constitutional convention part defined legislative structure representation state united states constitution it retained bicameral legislature proposed roger along proportional lower house required upper weighted equally among each two representatives 
agree warren wants abolish filibuster stupid abolish senate instead worry 
um we're republic comprised states and that's constitution negotiated written 
think easily see repurposed votes way popular vote that interstate voter compact gaining ground years plenty states left would join legislatures get recaptured democrats said chicken like nv me 
another option overturn permanent apportionment act expand house beyond members this would serve two purposes make representative people increase number electoral votes populous states the constitution originally called every today closer 
call constitutional convention point unless america completely collapses if going stopped amending constitution but anyway it's absolutely possible we can do this 
think getting rid ec lot likely shit people want tbh 
also it'd nice liberals alabama conservatives california impact presidential elections that alone would probably significantly drive voter turnout positive ripple effects political system 
gop wanting preserve implicitly admitting people hate 
doesn really matter slice points youre making bottomline presidency determined whoever gets votes there disadvantages advantages either party case 
one citizen vote that's matter borders city size party lines irrelevant one anything else political chicanery 
redistribution powers constitutional convention would ideal right people pay attention presidential elections therefore presidency become powerful more supposed keen see us move parliamentary system something similar 
think seems solid stances foreign policy the reason hear much complicated nuanced issues really challenging distill cable news type format also headlines like warren supports tactful leveraging broad diplomatic tools exactly generate lot buzz she get bit appearance pod save america might enjoy here's link https www youtube com watch muvqj vpxf 
pretty sure would unconstitutional argument reynolds sims https en wikipedia org wiki 
saw tweet posted dude it's literally she tweeted wants abolish 
the way abolish solely executive power she saying would support abolition convention opened expunge believe president able call event like probably work democratic majority house senate 
there vastly rural voters california wyoming the electoral college nothing representing interests that's modern red herring people come try justify continued existence 
hell thats ohio florida couple others if state swing waste time campaigning at least popular vote means person support actually wins how heck loser winner good idea 
think anyone interested pursuing abolition next election that makes sense 
this old republican talking point electoral college shit low density rural areas it's like ec getting farmer california attention campaigns target sparsely populated portions florida ten times many voters live metro all focus handful battleground states minority party populations across country get effectively disenfranchised 
geography vote areas cannot disenfranchised voters democrats run candidates address lower density rural area democratic values always we want trying appeal whose align party base platform regardless live also high urban chasing votes either friends family south midwest presidential never counted one time clinton election whomping dole the republicans california illinois new york nearly years there sensible defense one person central organizing hallmark principle democracy states regions voting rights individuals franchise it start act like 
we're never going get enough states adopt npvic go effect agree tall order think impossible wisconsin minnesota pennsylvania gets us michigan arizona virgina pushes past win state houses governor six and time several trending blue 
that plus house president longer functioning voice people supposed thanks gerrymandering cap number representatives ec if senate less power presidency democratic situation would fine imo the problem 
mean literally way i'm saying there's good reason keep 
unfortunately hard abolish legislative body without looking like tyrant caesar hitler emperor palpatine pretty much ruined move everyone 
one requires constitutional amendment rules change 
lmao say like abolishing senate would easier filibuster 
better yet reform filibuster make need support senators representing least population call vote 
that really respond issue when senate made largest state population smallest today half represents less dc even get senators people vermont wyoming if oversaw issues related balancing vs federal powers could make argument representing equally sense but since legislates exactly way house constrain wildly anti democratic anyway that's constitution negotiated written terrible it's originally elected appointed so there's room improvement original idea 
the two main options i've seen expanding house wyoming rule https en wikipedia org wiki every single district would number people per representative smallest large this increase size cube root root rule representatives cube population i'm sure others ones heard think implementing either great 
people deathly afraid article reason worked wolf pac years state people really reluctant open worms think good idea enough understand trust 
there disadvantages advantages either party case clear disadvantage gop allowing majority rule since americans favor liberal policies issues this mitch mcconnell said recently improving election security would give advantage democrats and republicans aggressively purging voter rolls based demographics rather automatically registering everyone know ideas doomed free society they're everything avoid 
mean ensures balance votes allocated per state population remains that tilt away big states the bigger issue see talking made politicians distant citizens used for example law came effect house member represented people size medium city today represents small metropolis would like actually congress expand many good number might politician pretty standard sized this lot things it make harder corporations coordinate influence campaigns since interact party politics weaker control larger body open opportunities representatives ratio representative time higher it's radical idea balk congressmen however think deal budget wise legislators insignificant massachusetts government manages fine as far whip consensus that's thing bill pass based liking back room deals finally terms making hard come legislation simply require another process even current legislature bills typically written smaller committees something similar happen expanded important part though unless approved majority full meaning take consideration broad appeal 
got that makes sense thank 
well various state level efforts tie electoral votes popular also battle whether go winner allocated proportionately one might presume could awarded district that's matter party policies election laws constitution 
to protect rights less populated states 
madam president plan everything what's dealing senate am the senate 
rephrase definitely think warren president send troops shut body it done constitutional amendment 
then let's get amendment going 
abolishing senate would much difficult see relevant it correct opinion going stick 
that sounds like status quo 
wyoming rule the proposal increase size united states house representatives standard representative population ratio would smallest entitled unit currently under article constitution state guaranteed least one if disparity populous states continues grow disproportionality continue unless fixed since except brief period expanded total seats required implement based census results cube root rule root cube calculated recent census applied many national legislatures parliaments first devised rein taagepera estonian political scientist pm https www reddit com message compose kittens space exclude wikitextbot excludeme subject subreddit np elizabethwarren banned faq information wiki index source github kittenswolf downvote remove 
it's constitutional convention could easily hijacked right wing groups oligarchs remove fundamental rights they're already mobilizing exactly https www esquire com news politics convention states campaign secession 
if ec candidates would campaigned completely different hillary tried win unsuccessful 
there doomed political parties throughout history we propping unfair system help one party mean said advantages disadvantages popular vote making things equals means taking away current repubs would lose putting equal ground but could creatures earth adapt die appeal larger voter base 
wait would eliminating electoral college impact federal spending all appropriations bills originate house representatives direct locally relevant form representation got level who wins presidency little funds allocated projects various states districts 
that's senate it's legislative body giving less populated states control legislation protect rights advances interests majority think justify unequal representation right gives resident wyoming political power california wild idea every american's vote count equally regardless state live 
abolishing filibuster meantime stupid though there's way hell we're going chance abolish senate near future ever really go bernie also cool idea involved vp tell fuck there's kinda rule can't remember tiebreak position exactly called i'd google 
yes comes would ratified states what's danger guess fear there's already many red might need ban abortion nation wide somehow unrealistic sense organize enough start convention organized prevent something radical unrelated coming 
million votes simple matter campaigning differently he unpopular candidate became president undemocratic system implemented states much independent whether clinton lost rules time irrelevant whether promotes minority rule good one 
welcome america we live democracy constitutional republic rights minority protected 
abolishing filibuster meantime stupid though there's way hell we're going chance abolish senate near future ever really go fair enough bernie also cool idea involved vp tell fuck there's kinda rule can't remember tiebreak position exactly called i'd google if right breaks tie vote senate matter unless overcome 
just quick things no battle ground states focus trump instance would campaigned tons illinois california tons nationally aired tv radio ads iowa maine small hardly see candidates ec really mind either way if away delayed give everyone plenty time prepare 
know democratic governor nevada away ec college worried small state would lose power influence came presidental candidates 
yeah prior election campaigning would done differently no presidential candidate campaign lot lower population states next years think ec needs slightly tweaked balanced abolished otherwise rural peoples forgotten national level completely 
know high school civics hard quote benjamin franklin hopefully clear democracy two wolves lamb voting lunch liberty well armed contesting vote 
this argument suggests way person wyoming learn candidate's positions candidate visit state ludicrous 
nah kind weighted system way candidate would ever care wyoming north dakota montana lot lower population states 
but ec supposed weighting it's founders trusting average person make informed choice 
it's secret i'm fan medicare all that's impressed senator elizabeth warren campaign reached her numbers add plan fully finances program without imposing new taxes middle class families zandi chief economist moody's analytic 
conversation going https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments dvwn economist warren right medicare 
yep lot ways corporate pundits opponents dared tax rich planned gave away dishonest game raise middle class taxes so went ahead said well case i'll keep payroll employer side replacing amount already spend premiums soak billionaires effectively giving workers pay portion sponsored insurance de facto there nothing economically morally wrong people similar amounts warren used political attacks way divide conquer brilliantly driven wedge affluent white collar like super wealthy small employee share significant hike as example expecting minimal month premium pays cost would replaced it definitely going big ask one core constituencies she found 
it's disappointing many economists never actually test assertions this one finally know every industrialized nation saving money who would thought 
boom skeptical policies warren plan that while candidates struggle create detailed plans deny they're needed puts defends well armchair professors flail trying call funding unviable without raising middle class taxes gets chief economist moody's analytics say no yelling rabid media attacks tweetbook mobs mobilized harass critics shitty nicknames labels opponents just quiet campaign show numbers prove worth this i'm train she legislator builds coalitions gets shit done 
do know means could tell but die 
medicare seems expensive look paying everyone price gouging rates pay if gov payer could set pharma companies made reasonable profit and government funded projects would sold cost issue become corrupt past decades see senators changing rules pharmaceutical still gouge us we really need try revert corporate hold lawmakers else real change ever come 
economics science many economists view policy world problem rarely admit wrong always double matter much real data disproves pet theory too ego involved keep hoping tariffs collapse economy reality come fruition they want proven even though economies like japan europe also protectionist policies work pretty well 
saw warren person last night swear snl nailed 
statistics definitely heavily mislead people daily basis however endorsement soundness warren's plan economist still great achievement

all americans approve elizabeth warren's wealth tax including republicans 
if republicans means independents wildly favor elizabeth extremely effective messaging could easily sell national debate stage 
it literally matter people think the rich buying policy https www youtube com watch tu cca ig 
it described plan though if expect significant drop support among republicans simply easy fox news right wing media mobilize we seen time number issues then consider fact uber rich would affected flood airwaves political discourse try stop may sow doubt amongst general public help however opinion overall shifted favor taxing this downplay idea wealth tax show polling always tell whole story challenge implement something absolutely worth fighting 
what amazes republicans worth million in fact would wager good chunk poverty line yet sort brain damage how right wing convinced many poor people help shield billionaires literally made fortune backs working class everything keep 
i've found many times west texas oil town if engage issues long avoid sound bites one liners they've already heard hannity carlson take fox find republicans agree democrats i'm well paid petroleum engineer coworkers all republican libertarian except even top dollar insurance plan hate company they think banks pilfered billions bailouts leaving millions hook shitty loans want legalize weed decriminalize hard drugs hell fine gay marriage dreamers staying doors citizenship although also new immigration massively reduced then guns abortion come spout absolutely childish conspiracy theory lose 
i've seen people saying wealth tax would require constitutional amendment direct explained plans avoid challenges 
so person million decides keep sitting checking every year government would take that taxed existing sit well we already know rich pay virtually zero taxes if made actually wealth earned plenty money and talking reported income report fraction make when makes huge companies used roads built employees schooled education system let country entitled cut profits after gets fair feel comfortable taxing the focus 
the truth much complicated minute video lets highly recommend reading lobbying policy change baumgartner et al https www amazon com wins loses dp short thick lobbying money game entrenched interests beat massive sums backed organized groups even array intellectual capital manhours towards issue want change partially reframed around time you ban tomorrow unlikely solve problems

elizabeth warren one people know explain things according article wealth tax violate constitution https verdict justia com yes even still 
so person million decides keep sitting checking every year government would take amount excess paid 
i'm taxed every year home one crying 
it's bit stretch think wealth tax benefits wealthy they probably support they're altruistic like many rich people higher taxes doesn't mean expect better enough money care 
thanks pointing correct op my main point still stands 
million my yearly property taxes currently amount net worth 
your property goes value every year cash loses inflation now person invests money tax profit make but philosophically disagree taxing tax investments profits increased wealth that possible infrastructure built blood sweat working class and staunch liberal made mind voting currently posting subreddits many candidates slowly warming warren 
for subject wealth tax little cash it would wasteful let sit 
that profit possible infrastructure built blood sweat working class so put back hands via taxes edit misunderstood getting although understand arbitrary line drawing money profits made 
agree tax profit create money today pay virtually zero taxes earned confused reported income if closed loopholes rich would fair share no need tax investments profits 
repeated many times still want tax rich just profits make due loopholes instead taxing money end year instead one time we taking back if bucks taxed never agree remaining next however profit investing the making huge every it philosophical thing something that goes someones property tax original cost used already unfair retired couple 
tax investments profits is would us tax if former property taxes continue and value million regardless latter change basis current minus purchase price 
it's obscenely wealthy hundreds millions dollars stashed around gift kids it creates dynasty generational wealth people born money horde whole lives trumps world people allowed simply remove economy if much literally sitting government taking small amount putting use year considering loopholes tax evasion schemes values million drop bucket yet could change fellow citizens universal healthcare debt free college student loan forgiveness etc also one letting sit most invested earning still means likely continue grow quite 
it current value minus purchase price never liked retired couple taxed something already paid taxes and expanded investments today wealthy pay virtually zero even long retire thanks many loopholes exist so instead taxing money tax profits profits able make infrastructure built working class roads schools police hospitals etc 
fine adjust tax rates effect outcome warren's plan would achieve we're good go

for like plan organically built point first time frontrunner race worked get she warmly received field biggest thing everyone beat trump 
generally yes like said really pushing anyone it info gathering 
ady barkan elizabeth warren right time admit medicare all saves americans money tax hike not 
can drop mention tax hike those comments conversations falling conservative trap it's irrelevant conversation is better deal stable reliable let's get important questions benefits single payer systems 
consistent message right wing america lower taxes good higher bad they're like fucking economic cave men so course want go national television say raise beat war drums summons people thunder dome she's fall we pivoted global warming climate change made sense conversation pivot health care tax health cost way 
i'm glad elizabeth admit best answer debate question funding medicaid giving soundbite worked right fix issue you're never gonna see donald trump it's one biggest things love liz fault work problem people perfect imagining politicians realistic 
now time must hammer away it's annual enrollment this find great insurance love soooo much price going keep cost low pick plan higher deductible copay or move doctor pay wonderful year company provides decides switch different provider and fellow retirees medicare maybe reimbursement part etc think matter those go conversation people always show plans change prices coverage goes mcfa stabilizes we'll never get better chance 
it saves lives americans champva va dependent insurance runs like medicare going found abnormal cells colon but years ago even went check maybe could save life not kids grandkids they might need see leave world we take care our tax dollars change worlds families loved ones 
it asinine criticize warren laying plan debate arguably one complex policy topics tackle which see getting lot flak what think major concern mfa policies lack private option even progressive friends professional jobs highly doubt realignment end healthcare could wrong seen latest laid recently announced coming put maybe exclude coverage 
know liz likes whole cent tax but c'mon cents or even 
honest question conservative told program switches private public quality drops since less incentive stet competitive what good response 
i'm going argue point ady necessarily accurate reason single payer japanese long term healthcare cheap structure really think it's heavily regulated that's many medical care cheaper japan us and japan government provided insurance also employer private insurnace max previous years income https www realestate tokyo com living health healthaffairs org doi hlthaff 
california election primary voter pre registration deadline http registertovote ca gov february www sos elections voter registration vote mail apply march general november 
she awkward debate stage trying defend medicare all probably bill bernie answered question moments later way honest easy understand stumbled ways wants placate left also scaring right idea gasp taxes go huge disservice needs stop triangulating start brutally manner sanders 
yeah plenty real policy based questions asked focus one that's completely worthless conservative talking point 
it's sad everyone mother intent getting soundbyte every time instead focusing points props liz playing game 
maybe im biased i'm getting annoyed fellow democrats providing gop ammunition general 
think way around embrace term tax hike take word back being afraid say means something bad raising taxes universal healthcare when person says respond hell yah people go bankrupt medical bills 
think it'd great tell people yes taxes may go never pay doctor's bill and get everything within reason covered understand higher tax mean services i'm really excited getting costs america how cure series pills taken period time hepatitis india it's pill upfront high like actually pushed become cheaper overall aca we start medical control absolutely besides greed 
buttigieg really tried nail rest so definitely smart jump releasing plan 
what address issue afterwards one colleagues brought debate response today good except point trying say need help addressing concern 
hope everything works but care like night day i'm glad live il expanded medicaid can't imagine state leaving aca money table how states tell constituents help politics still elected 
what get private option employer insurance balls it would still huge financial hit sick 
we allow private option insurance companies use manipulative marketing techniques sell americans inferior these spend years paying insurance they get cancer terminal illness company refuses cover cost adequately drops entirely never paid foots entire bill the repeat process hundreds thousands times causing run money needed participants all allowed continue existing lobbying bribing government weaken declared failure forever paraded around example try much better either end eventually torn 
the private option gives large hospital groups opportunity independently without collusion decide refuse take expanded medicare one problems ma long masshealth people go anywhere decent doctors would masshealth's reasonable lower non negotiable rates enough raise acceptable patient factories churning fast could get away much quality care that insurers still negotiate means pick absurd base rate need pay willing bought public availability market as exist way tell ray charge cash public band aid negatives aca stop growth medical profit cancer reduce amount money goes industry spent reasons direct healthcare further nobody incentivized make wealthy insurance anyway 
her recent news prepping detail financing single payer 
on subject private insurance think would anything wrong allowing additional but key word aditional this already case alternate experimental procedures bernie's bill stuff legislated way ensures companies customers pay system hospitals take average the problem medicare merely opt allow alternatives essentially breaks works probably end public option filled poorest sickest among us result awful quality healthcare warren could disarm whole 'banning insurance' thing said something easily work towards later line let's fix fundamental problems first or try come plan lot extra little effect basically exist placate ideological objections getting rid 
cuba world class doctors services public system administrated 
removed trolling there million subs bernie go one 
removed trolling you know full well ady warren committed people latching framework talking point never actually listened question 
think providing ammunition it's pointing they're going use regardless whether brush primary 
see also democratic socialists bernie sanders generally agree domestic policy kind term looking social democrat 
it work way unfortunately the conservatives push use complicated word that's contentious 
the sound byte worth taxes get universal healthcare it epic commercial voice narrator elizabeth warren wants to tax you death warren yes going year per household do have another feed the swamp 
she said she'll put funding plan the response taxes go premiums reduced people save money overall insurers killed suck longer sucked effectively pay instead income based premium government that's lower current 
want know did finally mention raising taxes 
live ny great coverage thank well wishes think fine tests get concerned red states say healthcare covered it wrong these children parents loved ones everyone deserves right richest country sick gofundme no pay taxes 
the private option medicare want awwi point current system either way would able get thinking easier quicker achieve serve 'glide path' towards form universal health care something else so really thing different ways seen either less ambitious practical depending camp one consider broader support for example back july poll http maristpoll marist edu wp content uploads npr pbs newshour marist poll usa nos tables pdf page showed respondents thought good idea versus majority people interviewed bad maybe since changed doubt needle moved whole lot write vs see https medium com polarea deep dive buttigieg plan sanders warren ca df dc 
banned bernie sub posting pro warren stuff lol 
framework not strongly recommend reading dylan's pos https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments djidky im young man ms elizabeth talked nk utm source share medium web comment he ms patient townhall frustrated warren's taken context used bash concerned patients like left current bill's transition period that's really but outrage goes viral facts 
the sound byte she intends tax medicare all if straight says middle class taxes used conservative ads outside context they spin make look expensive thousands dollars currently use voice say 
can articulate exactly difference two things seems like changing noun adjective the seems entirely semantic understand purpose serves 
dsa apparently changed mind bernie https www dsausa org bernie dsa endorsement debate process they used criticize since come believe he's best way wedge if endorsed biggest democratic socialist organization maybe get starting call 
see also democratic socialists bernie sanders generally agree domestic policy kind term looking social democrat point says capitalist try play whole actually democrats think would reject label 
they already follow conservative subreddit fox news anytime explain something good lose admit fact move keep offensive by saying increase taxes truth people even moderate like cnn continue challenge matter regardless 
that sounds pretty similar candidates said debate 
she laid plan medicaid all included tax increase would still save people money they'd spend less premiums higher taxes think refusal lay debate stage due fact elaborate want give soundbite used next year election 
yea ridiculous hosted thai student afs understand america even thailand single payer system keeps costs he's even doctor work years bangkok general could practice understands medicine quite well backwards in industrial countries besides us covered super power cover people 
the thing point warren sub promote bernie subs support defending even unwarranted attacks levied but try push instead similarly go bernie's convert battle ground poaching 
dunno think they're going figure way anyway this people mean say primary vetting candidates arguments love warren death since watched video eviscerating bunch bankers the daily show good fair thing bring points societal perceptions medicare all universal healthcare program run government funded taxes that's if idea take decently wide majority country i'm opinion spend leftover political energy push relatively unpopular ten million immediate problems need solve 
welfare state socdem stuff so rent controls expanded safety nets even requiring public companies put worker representatives board socialism government community seizing means production traditionally dsa criticized bernie here's long article january speaking run socialist perspective https www leftvoice org case against per atlantic technically like america capitalist theatlantic com international archive bernie sanders democratic socialism words meaning people trying use less edgy attempt win election that support lot pushing though longer identify socialist really 
yeah commercial ends this ad paid biden for president fact make much effective warren wins primary general 
not really it's bernie said buttigieg biden klobchar disingenuous taxes like doubly worse premiums the fact cost people will be higher if you want it plan their plans costly 
maybe competition would get soundbite someone hoping nomination seemed disingenuous weak especially compared bernie able explain concept briefly clearly repeatedly top spot warren downplayed concerns automation effecting unemployment 
insurance corporations healthcare simple think started late 
trying convert anyone in fact promote positivity two groups like sanders win believe warren electable encouraging fans aware supports similar things consider adopting policies because want democrat what said factual based explanation trolling 
the problem everyone already knows answer questions asked they like how giving why big deal announce sky blue way that's going favor opponents they're accusing funding taxes respond less savings instead they're trying get sound bite admit something obvious harmless and somehow hurting polling reject corrupt line questioning so power imo single payer awesome enough resist bullshit attacks general see reason bugging improve anything anyone it's dirtier parts party playing dirty far tell failing 
understand warren would better bernie plans total alpha acknowledged taxes go it's harder connect beta avoids answering questions guess that's 
there chance anyone sub know bernie early major advocate comment nothing say beyond first you're absolutely going engendering positivity adding posts warren whether meant basically indistinguishable trolling edit what zerexthecool said 
love warren sanders can't let get contentious like two dem bases got cannot believe facing much hostility simply setting record straight it's misleading pretend time admit since one candidate admitting ignoring fact another transparent along admit also odd way say stop afraid soundbite have courage stand behind policies support 
think short your intent totally fine reading comment sound like describing it sounds trolling bet could gotten message across said one sentence and would removed longer 
in sub pretty much guarantee know bernie advocated medicare all many us voters last time 
think pretty much percent warren supporters also like sanders know stance issues voted primary sure many others well 
because prefer warren actually wanted run think electable

removed please post conspiracies sub 
still think one worst moves hillary clinton really counter everytime lied debate she would say go website people explaining lies real time which sure extremely hard able someone everything helped shut engaged instead repeatedly punting check wish warren pick steam actually engage directly starts lying cause work point spot ever tried only journalists countered turns huge baby imagine warren done minutes multi hour 
fyi hermione eventually becomes minister magic equivalent president wizarding world 
exactly more people need realize if issue arises warren one talking negotiating everyone day studying night sleeps cover every angle problem which makes wonder should start canvassing harry potter sub 
he charged head first fight rightfully but warren right already studied strengths weaknesses including contingency plans 
it's usually best practice cross woman resolve risk altering parents memories 
mean i'll fight either way man let's spread word find one 
man described could easily spun accepted people sign leadership show passion throwing things screaming get men called assholes steve jobs lots like admire widely regarded asshole even apple fanatics most say anything gets results one working skin back which also mostly i'd feel klobuchar fact going staffing department labor 
seeing distinguished makes love sub thank 
countering someone excellent bullshitting extraordinarily tough great recent example bannon maher last weekend smart dude pretty quick really hold task way clearly set

it's bullshit asymmetry principle the amount energy needed refute order magnitude bigger produce fundamental part gish gallop technique if overwhelm opposition enough lies becomes impossible address 
true easy study times gets mad disengages reporters walks really trump well wanna say smart efficient bannon and prone gotten which would happen every debate moderators jobs 
ah that's true thanks reminder 
agree women subjected unfair double standard wish use excuse lower bar instead raising men the real problem behavior always line letting jerks get away 
oh there's nothing wrong saying bannon smarter twitler far stupid man even wits directed abhorrent cunning clever neither wise 
suggest focus energy elsewhere but yes looks like happening shhhhh 
talking dad days ago necessarily like candidates made offhand comment warren likely nominee it's super uplifting outsiders starting see even though may first polls right becoming clear biden strong hold lead going last frontrunner

in three last four polls rcp leading one least close that's average still biden slightly still wow also really hope odd number people november debate bc looking increasingly likely could take center stage case 
she plan win election her plans tend work 
as someone admired liz since created cfpb top entire campaign i'm awe methodical rise nothing fancy no big blips just steady march upward bravo staff 
and economist's tracker within points point gap last month https projects economist com democratic primaries 
sanders whose nomination prospects could suffer heart attack last week saw support fall registering prior two months said expects participate oct debate while glad prospect either warren think important point one polls heavily weighing bernie's dip ibd lower national time period there's question frontrunner comes traditional polling premature say large number supporters shifting 
um i'm color blind really hard read can somebody put words gist good 
time fight even harder help warren wo nomination beat trump 
see much curves wiggle crossover mean keep fighting 
finally picked right one ron paul bernie time wizened 
looks like bernie supporters jumping warren camp definitely aligned positions 
remember hillary polled all matters get vote 
for reason mind immediately went the creation adam https upload wikimedia org wikipedia commons thumb sistine chapel ceiling michelangelo jbu cut jpg px 
rcp really polling aggregator wanna cite good news traction lot ground still cover time work continuing build momentum celebrate early lead 
guess explains propoganda i've heard past week now they're saying lied teacher one year including professor fired pregnant explicit previous interview 
as die hard sanders supporter break heart warren strong second pick still win 
gonna predict biden taking south warren north she presidency easy gets aa 
iowa election caucus voter registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
warren definitely gaining momentum today's morning consult poll rcp https www realclearpolitics com epolls latest polls democratic nomination shows biden not take wind anyone's sails lower tier candidates bernie drop expect break away pack there's pie biden harris buttigieg core supporters going switch teams easily lot happen iowa caucus february rd i'd december january qualifying criteria debates peel anyone polling bellow nationally narrow field however team combine it'll hard overcome super tuesday like said could like see whole contest would moot we'll wait 
does anyone know happens debate order guess already locked 
yeah absolutely idea but thank perfectly happy anonymous donor she worth every penny 
that's cool honestly polls mean jack squat anymore know crushing iowa you super star 
hiya small time youtuber covers politics y'all want play victory music passes 
indeed the morning consult poll later biden consistently scores warren barely breaks ibd promising gap might open back end day here's hoping nails mc let's assume work done 
focus energy volunteering campaign every little bit helps 
for worth think warren's success owes awful lot bernie he fundamentally changed conversation last election many people serves leftward candidate compare biden warren makes centrists perceive moderate choice appeal that said i've seen several friends raise concerns positions wealth tax there's work done 
better issues come he's nominee right love respect sen sanders he always strong voice energized lot people helped reduce apathy earned place history affected consciousness nation 
what's interesting news bernie's heart attack came october nd look dates polls averaged latest one even data poll respondents rd it looks drop already happening prior 
months warren higher biden dem candidates withdrawing definitely change landscape like mom told eat brocolli elizabeth put butter cheese crackers broccoli 
still early look line he's consistent range entirety polling average feel like base staying warren taking fence undecided voters 
if like send image donation receipt remove personal info mods we'll give special donor top flair 
the economist's version polling line https projects economist com democratic primaries thing beauty 
that's certainly i'm trying say posting just almost ahead biden exciting 
more warren support comes harris expense 
it certainly early say bernie losing supporters he's still hovering around average what clear averages warren one gaining support since july 
warren risen near exact level biden terms average poll percentage seemingly surpass becoming front runner 
saw the guy authored article pretty clear axe grind as much dislike attacks make stronger end let us know argue kinda stuff 
on bright side worried warren sanders would split progressive vote biden win looks like might able overtake anyway 
please she's worked ass this hype 
am woman hear me roar 
just quick browse polls start september th trump right wing media industrial complex made whataboutism pivots biden main strategy showing point dips if trend continues imagine this important candidate favorable already pretty high the starts pumping nightmare fuel nominee going take hit 
fucking morning consult swear god harrisx 
it's odd understand democrats oppose tax increases top bracket unions working class used defining base party mean great reasonable republicans fleeing tent voice would middle poor totally take dnc 
true if bernie end dropping possibility becomes new 
hope warren appoints white house elected 
it really started back sept th at point passed shot since however remained pretty steady oct st dropped much lowest support 
i'm also slightly worried we're getting buttigieg effect warren's campaign great polling solely high amount good media surrounding dies she'll begin drop steeply 
oh understand see people making false assumptions based graph not trying steal thunder means 
thanks that's good hear i'll admit i'm tank bernie warren biden even know want drop loses trump general 
we assume things necessarily fall way course take work persistent standing bad faith narratives make happen unfortunately seen quite examples politics situations questions invented nothing especially made mistake born woman existence enough people decide guilty 
good point notice new mc poll replace old one change much but get one bad harrisx garbage fox news gap open back it's definitely done deal yet keep working spreading message man beats next going feel good 
to fair concern among friends increase taxation income rather wealth come conclusion attack here's direct quote double baaaaad idea just hint drive mass exodus capital usa double whammy it cause depression boost growth countries if liquid holdings million point becomes worth move said money actually passed want stock market real estate bonds would bad fixing ridiculous loophole ridden tax codes corporate structures billionaires pay less millionaires favor 
the watergate babies entered congress election wanted move away new deal coalition saw white working class racist sexist incompatible direction party going civil rights era they instead replace peace coalition educated whites hated vietnam nixon minorities liked civil rights act democratic leadership time still much mindset quickly took major defeat wave democrats take wright patman kinda similar warren huge watchdog banks after carter reagan destroyed old democratic complete control rebranded third way democrats less controlled today like think squad watergate babies building non jessie jackson argued 
secretary labor sanders or else health human services get medicare all running education work making public college free wherever warren thinks fits best 
but us already taxes citizens' income made countries two person household warren's plan modeled could avoid wealth tax hiding shady illegal places 
that's informative always thought third way clinton's idea seems like trend predates 
sec education someone background educator labor would perfect fit imo 
unfortunately since he's democrat never happen 
yup they're scared not beating bernie verge biden you know next so that's turned three groups stay strong liz 
i'm excited poll numbers would like point polls results mean they're skewed and ones accurate all pollsters different methodologies better others dislike necessarily fox news instance shockingly actually excellent polling record just important keep mind think thinking dangerous 
we'd deceiving thought warren aggregate polling leader while would nice mean essentially tied frontrunner status still surging momentum necessarily huge thing want draw best fit lines showing taking lead really means pretty well still needs make big inroads supertuesday states though 
or becoming citizen another country 
she also promised secretary education would former teacher iirc 
he's currently campaigning democrat's candidate president pretty sure he'd ok taking senate majority leader position 
there's significant exit tax citizens high wealth renounce citizenship warren's plan ups even it would take time leaving became financially beneficial choice 
sure give american citizenship dual citizens still pay though 
not ok rather dem caucus voting he played nice relations wise warren but doubt bernie even wants senate majority leader that role becomes bogged lot politics the man gunning chair two specific committees help committee finance committee 
it's he's okay he's member party agreed run democrat president independent senate therefore part majority regardless whether democrats take technically could probably given senior position definitely majority leader want 
oh gotcha misunderstood my bad see lot political communities polls good basically fake just want infiltrate warren club but totally right harrisx poll probably brining back bit unfortunately 
how would help us the net result billionaires taking billions elsewhere 
getting cleared spend significant time us non citizens pain even nice shithole countries actual jobs why would someone want give kind access

fun fact katie porter iowa perhaps campaign warren 
porter excellent explaining complex topics common sense language she huge middle class moderate appeal warren needs voters midwest

yeah porter actually named daughter elizabeth might middle name remember warren meant much

our education system based science technology way future generally agree everything wrote except part yes drive global economies solve lot issues hopefully like environmental challenges anyone pursuit direct educational paths direction however ever wonder get people zuckerberg others become beyond government powerful little insight impact it vitally important arts humanity history etc well rounded further comes jobs taken away require stem aptitude fields suited many saying also receive proper that still everyone understand accept instead reject ignorance fall false beliefs think society continue pursue 
ah bad thought dig aoc especially since article seems comparing rising stars endorsements 
we're ready get party started still early lot established names throw weight around plus good publicity warren always needs 
pretty much yeah doubt if talking nuerosurgery things around carson he'd completely school really people world even still sounded half asleep but anything else he comes pretty damn clueless 
ohhhh so question actually knew implication trying make lie whole time well consider warning trolling 
nah like aoc need young people government she regular person got voted ideas party affiliation stand everything line votes it one think themself opinion anymore mean common interests shout differences 
sen warren wells fargo ceo you fired span 
if every state could contribute one elizabeth warren us senate might able fix nation 
stuff like i'm board warren wow goes hard drills slimy pos if president least needs secretary treasury he tries make every answer canned commercial wf proud credit card products wells fargo cuts love also maybe pet peeve really really hate banks call crap it's product can't buy loan whatever financial agreements two parties kind hold end item set perceived value btw work finance i've worked large bank believe one mostly good ones there's still stuff behind closed doors account holders aware for example know unique scoring system factors whether get approved you could legit score transunion bank's arbitrary identifies high risk person assigns according underwriting polices means automatic turn saw happen many times seem improve final months left illegal we need people elizabeth bring real meaningful change candidate passionate protecting consumers' rights see individual protected slimeball companies way engaging gross egregious violations various kinds 
think lot people gravitate toward warren powerful villains live among us one brave enough name demand better right faces 
this kind planning brought board in questioning everything knew would start end 
the younger generations lean left democratic politicians seem ones give shit 
this one powerful things ever uttered senate would watch 
this one favorite warren videos 
how much want bet crap arm better call saul level bs trying evoke sympathy also excellent display never ask question already know answer rule 
so we'd fifty copies best selves that could 
what distinguishes sanders the two might go bit time goes see similar 
policy wise similar bernie wrecking ball approach warren surgical detailed other like she younger more universally relatable looks aunt oklahoma uses personal stories special needs teacher sunday school think age jewish heritage work sad likely true come scary socialist better credentials harvard law professor lawyer created cfpb career politician wasn previously defeated presidential election 
they relatively similar policy wise like warren think easier work effective bernie actually getting policies implemented also able develop stronger relationships foreign leaders 
for personally appreciate bernie tried protect consumers warren prominent helping create cfpb opposed bapcpa authored co contributed countless financial regulation commercial law textbooks really steadfast campaign improve boring people otoh goes sexy talking points finance minimum wage hikes reform audit fed etc don't get wrong great i'm glad he's bulldog stuff parts behind scenes things screwing regular basis even aware finally there's personal aspect transforming republican democrat that speaks used got started reading books 
my general impression sanders problem warren solution they complement well way 
as others noted also concerned bernie's age especially he good health difficult job world stress hell body assuming best case scenario would almost years old end presidency the chances making next vigor vitality president needs slim like bernie lot wait 
sanders ultimately wants push us towards socialism see capitalism viable warren sees best system recognizes operated serious issues regulate fuck 
the big difference bernie warren willing take corporate donations general election 
think optics with money get sense you product end base feels really bad user but inside absolutely agree makes conceptualize products manage like would line 
thanks you provided bunch info know agree bernie age could hurt election think warren lumped crazy socialist talk sanders if mainstream yet bet faces biden trump that said take or least better chance 
not add much weight also like idea voting woman my country dudes white house times row mind seeing tradition shook little bit finally 
don forget work consumer protection bankruptcy law think something really needs play win mid west 
not saying buy sort logic based past results woman worse jewish general election also think warren sanders biden trump use age thing since they're old 
thanks explanation think need look definitions capitalism socialism thought regulated less 
agree big banks broken cancelling student debt the lower income folks need larger share canceled upper class support equality outcome general principle redistribution 
why getting downvoted do evidence support claim know look candidates accept donations much 
if posted link removed greatly appreciate dm 
pete buttigieg like candidate correct said something effect democrats lumped crazy socialists don't pay attention bs focus think help america 
think pundits hard time actually calling warren crazy socialist every indication points rejecting title together she's experienced faithful capitalist knows system needs keep average american water bernie's open acceptance label democratic albeit unfairly toxic uninformed older voters terrified word socialism cold war propaganda stop listening soon hear because probably age rate chances trump highly warren's voters rural arizona wisconsin michigan happily listen oklahoman capitalist they rejected show signs going blue path least resistance getting opinion 
you go one rallies she great speaker answers questions directly hesitation clearly thought deeply concerns american citizens stripes appears empathy sure anticipated would debate criminal chief doubt several layers ideas 
absolutely and think whole lot people know provided policy knowledge occupy wallstreet 
yes warren use comparison bernie although old critical point feel could two terms significantly older already one term likely therefore big advantage 
that's sold right us correct socialism economic system rather one person controlling means production capitalist capital socialism workers businesses 
student debt plan without college kicking another decade 
https www apnews com ce 
warren buttigieg two candidates philosophically logically sound enough essentially communications directors clearly oversimplification incredibly obvious savvy importantly rock solid beliefs competent trusted completely shoot unexpected time response random question could come way moment they converse without teleprompter generally fine stellar imagine huuuuge relief campaign staff opposed simply put biggest liabilities prone making unforced errors failing stay message symptom lack true conviction 
thanks suggestion attended political rally interested attending town hall kind setting almost available youtube days agree well thought passionate 
saying lying wrong definitely still learning heard bernie say anything effect talk government intervening healthcare drugs gun control child care taxes etc but talking flipping private sector like described that big difference two candidates though 
her plan literally calls universal free college https medium com teamwarren im calling something truly transformational public cancellation cd 
elizabethwarren feature links website please submit unreliable extremely biased sources check see rules section allowed bot action performed automatically contact moderators subreddit message compose questions concerns 
you're forgetting one bernie logically consistent candidate race he's message years 
that's he's really one either he says socialist way gop means policies make what's called social democrat european countries capitalist democracies robust safety net 
cool thanks know appreciate link 
nah considered including earlier comment but despite impeccable philosophical consistency see lot sides sanders campaign trail times pretty clearly trying hard adhere messaging tone staffers likely determined prudent yet occasions voluntarily skirted notably simply avoid taking bait sometimes again turned kind impulsivity strength sorts hand always worked well he sticks foot mouth time beyond often conspicuously one note reservedly message group warren buttigieg level rhetoric dexterity discipline love guy appreciate genuineness 
the way gop means socialism authoritarianism so completely wrong definition 
that would make sense lol 
no problem sorry came condescending 
yea think sanders great candidate i'm voting warren reasons laid also get sense bernie person work context lot abrasive expect harder time building coalitions required actually policy place compared 
elizabeth warren shines first democratic debate 
talking dad i've big bernie guy since bursted onto scene really eye warren she's certainly reinforced intrigue 
already pro warren two impressions great answers strong openers closers she keeping powder dry letting weaker candidates sort fight amongst that approach bother considering top lineup first debate strategic think planned plus one went either of others thought castro helped lot good presentation coming way back lots substance though vp potential beto got rhetorically elbowed kicked shins times diblasio talked loud interrupted frequently little effect recall many non latino trying spanish previous elections my snarky side says let see leads gabbard delaney go home all unmentioned continue ride bus till next they bad stand mind 
this best tl dr could make original https thehill com homenews campaign warren shines first democratic debate reduced i'm bot the nbc moderators often framed questions candidates terms warren policy proposals establishing massachusetts democrat key figure stage asked question top second hour little bit luck also side microphone issue prompted take unscheduled commercial break allowing time think response gun control extended summary http np reddit autotldr comments ank faq fm faq version drs far feedback message compose pm's monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords candidate 
it also helps pretty much adult kiddie table thanksgiving not complaining though public speaking coach deserves raise 
was sort shriveled danced around gun question know read situation right felt kinda bad otherwise loved hosts would bring topic she'd light ready answer instantly raised hand private insurance companies she get ideas good makes happy 
she looked upset get talk immigration obviously right move stoop level interrupters the answer gave thought little weak gun control good soundbite that said approach essentially lets brainer things research rest take it loaded question fed conservative 'they're coming guns talking point other takes castro impressive delivery bit aggressive interrupting this needed perk people's ears though far guys ends deblasio inslee better expected i'm torn given i've heard nyers beto drop got eviscerated section code wrt criminality crossing border he really anything offer sad anecdotes platitudes ryan delaney psh cares stage also learn difference taliban al qaeda klobuchar booker gabbard see needs expand issues gain much support 
able catch minutes debate last night i'm normally one watches debates especially politics big like voted basically throw vote away voted someone shits giggles figured would lose anyways turns fucker anyways warren stood she sounds like shes extremely smart need next president total opposite shit bird loved speech investing creating green energy she's right it going trillion dollar industry start researching so far coming raised republican still hold conservative views also progressive dont know political affiliation honestly whatever elizabeth's 
be lookout andrew yang tomorrow night all three killer progressive candidates opinion 
he stood tonight think warren well expected thinking castro ticket 
after debate lineups announced thought would disadvantage think actually played strengths she easily winner leg tonight sanders biden tear apart turn voters liz coming without fight nights 
really surprised castro thought corporate loser might 
you mention tim ryan think ended campaign last night tiff gabbard he go home 
booker stand thought one better debaters 
delaney hear heard applause ring nose 
don't need someone stand qualify though know one shot fair candidates sometimes ain't year 
think lot time first hour used well sort sat back second let candidates fight 
well blame captivating orators like amy klobuchar 
had lot time first hour forgot existed frustrating think gave performance needed pad lead least 
she may coach since literally got start way back 
the questions gun control guns americans already taken back thought stumbled first really appreciated demand research distinction owners like drew attention fact enough data prove effective tactic removing circulation respect honesty essentially saying easy answer specific question lack instead ignoring talk do remove homes seconds less take 'em leave makes great sound bite address responsible plan would implemented given warren releasing plans feel reasonable extend time develop appropriate addresses intricate nature charged 
disagree love ability pragmatic sticky subjects play core concerns wealth gap environment she populist message win say going take everyone guns away 
the question completely idiotic help should government take guns back 
no feel like booker point gun license gun registration 
think stood candidate bold ideas answer guns less not wrong terribly aggressive approach correct seemed weak 
the option call todd stupid fucking question ignoring right choice candidates spoke topic 
thought good answer gun laws she oklahoma doubt shrieks sees probably competent realized realistic solution joe manchin would agree see public health crisis 
that definitely worst moment cringed answer said great first hour standout healthcare probably widely circulated also forget shallower aspects debate thought best tone inflection anyone she came across intelligent confident passionate relatable authentic it flawless performance happy 
she look really content answer either it fucking trap question though booker better response answering instead talking license registration far cry hey going confiscate guns 
turns fucker does administration feel like joke voting 
billionare buying way presidency progressive if wants good trying lower office rather saying money gives permission president whim 
also skeptical personal level reluctance criticize trump 
yang couple great ideas he's light weight 
warren yang top picks they deep thinkers bold policy proposals obviously earnest compassionate demeanors there candidates pool democratic likes seen decades ladies gentlemen could beginning new golden era american history elect one charactered leaders 
hmm foreign policy immigration weak spots well issues tonight there definitely worse choices de blasio also way better thought would 
my wife said thing warren castro ticket would fantastic choice 
why people trying push castro far right warren's policy he's another centrist 
tiff would never million years cast primary vote gabbard glorious glad someone finally said military industrial complex cannot beat taliban 
liked though thought really nice hear new voice forgotten communities i'm small rural town bit bias badly explained think understood trying say no one wants us afghanistan forever we're still south korea country world better we might plan stay engaged maintain permanent presence 
his lips disappeared responded lmao 
booker pretty familiar he say anything felt like heard 
it weird hear talk pharma money like he's taken hundreds thousands big donations years candidates first second tiers 
foam beer hold sec i'm setting th burn night trump did catch burned 
honest god remember single response amy klobuchar she unremarkable think she'd eaten absolutely alive trump debates also tulsi gabbard really weird pauses slllooowwdooowwnnnss speech drove little nuts shoehorning military service every answer call got old weirdly though left debate slightly positive much 
plus matter answer confiscate going piss people sides issue saying hey need treat gun violence like public health crisis research solution works americans something almost owners realistically get behind it soundbite think best and that's coming somebody personal way would repeal nd amendment completely 
agreed could've delivered smoother liked acknowledgement research effective solutions think borrowed short term long distinction used delaney she couldve easily said common sense gun control laws immediate impact followed investigation root cause violence pandemic develop target problem lawful owners getting data form solution is legitimate plan reason uncomfortable avoiding hard yes whether take guns away smart inflammatory topic even know good idea yet 
how gun buyback work chuck todd it's uh literally name 
agree point argument right constitutional validity driving car owning gun he's treading slippery slope 
but answer question government remove guns already people's homes 
really concerned focused year focusing true causes income inequality 
he essentially wants end welfare what lot yang gang bring opt government assistance like snap medicaid etc order get ubi 
it really grinds gears people media call vat robot tax not mention dishonest numbers the way could barely work taxes daily goods 
yeah feel think tactic trying bring people sides want alienate trump supporters would approach either either way lot ideals far left ones actually aim help he's worth serious consideration and course posting support different candidate sub gets horribly downvoted 
castro also might put texas play beto run senate 
de blasio surprising showed executive progressive experience did hear allusion pete south bend shooting he's tough mayor although warren tonight's debate stood sure 
de blasio solid speaker debater would lose trump likely pol new york hates 
agree prepared hate de blasio impressed 
most definitely imagine could help solidify florida honestly comprehensive plan immigration far warren good admitting someone already saying 'i'm bernie' last night great example think area really benefit castro's experience expertise 
because veep build coalition really anything 
he really his positions immigration particular insanely progressive groundbreaking centrists exactly say things like reproductive justice the fit warren political courage perspective good far 
having far left prez veep lose general the needs bring demographics might feel compelled vote warren she polls pretty terrible moderate conservative dems surprisingly exist down want fact poorly outside liberal democrats 
his take maybe little extreme even realism candidates simply put make far current dem climate talking like personally feel complete disengagement possible obviously simple 'pull errybody out' its complex issue imo poorly calculated trying point format 
booker completely changed campaign progressive one last night 
ah see i'm unfamiliar large number candidates really stuck he surprising choice veep imo 
but argue terms part winning public debates setting debate that strategy right forward less developed novel legal theories change interpret nd amendment according widely held understandings offered new altogether or think something like besides sure driving car constitution arguably much central daily american life essential citizenship community sense especially given history segregated transit freedom mobility provided lots people and i'm urbanist wants massively expand transport expense cars 
the main cause inequality disparity inter generational wealth yang supporter guaranteed month provides cushion allows individuals undertake variety pursuits educational entrepreneurial otherwise it could replicate safety net wealthier people entire lives 
yeah exactly his ubi plan basically paying poor people fuck allowing things get much worse 
think ubi worth discussing putting radars it future need establish first if make priority tackle issue y'know making another years planet we've got priorities mixed 
the feasible way ubi happening medicare universal baseline healthcare 
if somebody would get benefit value staying existing programs option good thing 
beto going back run senate castro vp slot could definitely put texas play now really want happen 
he able win forcing gop defend somewhere would normally well boost ticket races victory 
bdb better thought he's still pos he's progressive talks enough like one get elected we bunch lousy choices mayor since weiner stop sexting teens best rest spineless tool 
keep hearing bad things bdb new yorkers reserve judgment 
he's new yorker rise top city without something presence 
nah underestimating much new yorkers hate trump wins mile score 
hate i'm genuinely confused upstate sitting seems like pretty good available accomplished tough tasks universal pre minimum paid sick leave without destroying nyc economy 
really surprised like debate he's vp short list it could bring hispanics usually vote obama especially immigration continues hot topic there's nothing wrong 
name isnt literally bernie sanders 
you lose general picking people dont mobilize voters trying balance ticket get another clinton pick attracting biggest crowds young 
yes shocked aggressive shunning pharma money its needs doesnt change past taking huge donations industry apology tour much gabbard walking back anti lgbtq views 
not mention cars exist constitution made guns that maybe tiny bit 
agree ubi important necessary future rather implement emergency like yangs version replaces government assistance month disqualify social security snap etc 
ubi necessary discussion one wants talk would de facto create sharp divide see way around discussing 
it better ubi actually universal affect benefits also kind reverse means testing wealthy people take advantage 
this good point mean last minute rush resources defend upper midwest blue shield definitely took hit hrc campaign 
msnbc chris matthews defends bloomberg multiple sexual harassment claims criticizes liz believing women that also accused 
plus there's fact woman's story corroborated another coworker man matters bloomberg told employee get abortion face straight lied debate stage 
chris matthews fox news pundit got lost way first day work

bloomberg lied debates stop frisk called opposition we heard tapes explicitly calling dictionary definition racial profiling right if willing repeatedly lie something easily disprovable contemporary court records reporting refuse believe denials woman said told 
why anyone surprised chris matthews always idiot liar 
https www mediamatters org chris matthews sexist displays go beyond clinton redirect source research chris matthews long history sexism 
although agree bloomberg really gone sanders fuzzy math lackluster resume 
it corroborated coworkers substantiated nbc said formally reprimanded matthews behavior citation https www vanityfair com hollywood nbc chris matthews sexual harassment just one predator sticking another bloomberg victims conveniently subject ndas we collectively stop pretending mr ability speak credibility anyone else's accusations 
and brought bunch paid shills viciously boo warren every time opened mouth cheer lies he really truly get kill liz's campaign care bernie knows nothing done his presidential literally physical manifestation ann coulter tweet edit go said there's way contingent directed extremely anti 
firechrismatthews let get trending pls 
i've said entire time they'd sanders happily warren they've ignored hurt repeatedly throughout campaign that's 'normal' media bias chris matthews crossed line cycle he's got go 
yes still covered chris matthews also msnbc nbc 
from i've read the right wing daily caller reported msnbc paid settlement assistant producer matthews show inappropriate remarks allegedly made usa today network's investigation incident found sophomoric poor taste meant propositions received formal reprimand but network would elaborate employee departure compensation package caller's credible source given chris matthews' behavior believe 
i've found utterly bizarre people say bloomberg entered stop bernie stagnant fading got race warren height billionaire tear fueled rise 
that tweet necessarily bad thing warren if anything compliment 
he almost admitted buying congress people think fair assume chorus compensated 
bloomberg sucks number debate tickets every campaign there's evidence whatsoever paid shills made portion audience really wish sub propogate style conspiracy theories without factual backing 
bloomberg taking votes likely would otherwise go biden st might singlehandedly hand sanders nomination he's running attack ads race helping anything says 
doubt bernie would still warren forced message elitism healthcare debacle biden pete got away murder leaning every sexist epithet could throw woman politician it probably moment started really souring looking back 
right that's tweet bloomberg running billion dollar campaign stop 
fair enough contingent quite clearly anti warren night no way coordinated 
yeah guess audience pro discrimination hide taxes illiteracy sure 
to fair though non campaign seats apparently pop typical sanders warren supporters going spend 
owner different network point nbc sucks covering matt lauer's history creepy behavior msnbc also letting chris matthews say crap like comparing bernie fans nazis consequences 
bloomberg fully intends run third party spilt trump opposition he's always done help republican golf buddy get elected 
missing point purpose plug rule please 
the bloomberg supporters given tickets cheered i'm sure need weave bizzare conspiracy paid shills dnc plants maybe coached evidence whatsoever as someone got called shill dozens times audacity support hillary clinton reddit think accusation thrown around wildly hard occurred pro illiteracy sanders' constant caping socialist autocrats awful deserved booed terrible defense charactererizing opposition stance disingenous hell get nonsense 
mean like sanders think understanding i'm saying she got forced message sexist labels thrown moderate candidates caused back fighter mantra gained following allow opponents define combined sanders' bounce heart attack drop fall we saw getting highest marks past two debates people ripping people's arms strategically

personally think tried court sanders supporters instead biden still seen bernie lite truth she needs separate wants win 
the answer simple people are policy warren almost certainly detailed plans however average viewer wants everything described one sentence nuance much 
i'd hardly say 'stalling' overtook 'most electable' front runner biden yeah sanders mayor ahead one tiny state showed electable who's electability ticket potus the media reporting that's news ia

elizabeth warren jumps points debate favorability 
it fascinating see jump points seeing siphoning post debate she drawing biden bernie harris buttigieg undecideds people switching key success going forward 
this tracking poll people watched debate knew would asked changed mind so numbers reflect liz biggest winner almost definitely receive point bump nationally edit spelling 
think going pull lot bernie supporters presents pragmatic way achieve success progressive policies ultimate downfall ideas abstract sense without also proposing sound policy options accompany that people progressives idiots on hand warren methodical precise plans goals 
it's funny seeing closeted republicans family rapidly pivot hating warren past two days like bernie sanders prior object obsession never existed call they're registered democrats kinds say wish could vote republican smart enough know that's dumb move brown person 
seeing debates made much supportive warren she's got ideas point background inspiring she excellent job hope wails biden next debate 
warren net approval gain second among first night juli castro he certainly helped people knowing already far recognized candidate onstage one o'rourke delaney actually lost 
how choose candidates part debate would expected night 
literally candidate whose unfavourable numbers went debate that impressive she poised think answered doubters worried would awkward wonkish 
thought pretty interesting candidate least night one data drop unfavorability everyone saw sort gain favorability people opinion gaining positive warren net decrease else increase viewed unfavorable 
damn th kamala leapfrogged third 
what's favorability looking question asked people come number do approve job president approval 
interesting graph warren major candidate loose many supporters see thickness lines left side 
she flipped love bernie voted warren clearly sharper energetic electable candidate 
shows plays lot messaging substance most people really locked candidate hell four want consider warren see falling choices castro example made strong pitch fifth choice same buttigieg began heard coming booker harris preferred order think anyone right it far early we favorites willing listen entire field fuck tell and actually worth vote they'll either change minds able explain us believe drawing effectively 
just anecdotally facebook feed lately basically https imgflip com icfu jpg 
according charts warren sanders two candidates gained favorable opinions lost unfavorable drawing anything away data suggests clear frontrunners slightly leading popular candidate still gaining according 
and reflect night yet wait tomorrow see effect combined events 
interesting note she candidate night unfavorable rating went that really odd her favorability notably unfavorability bit interesting 
thanks pointing misleading headline when first post debate poll is next months based new numbers less people still 
plus pretty badly debate think pulls vast majority support 
their new talking points uploaded directly brains via fox friends 
same i've never excited poll lol 
rourke face looks likes wondering like us 
all candidates first split two categories people polling ii then lottery style drawing debates debate include half category what unfortunately happened five biden bernie warren pete kamala ended one random luck put folks booker klobuchar beto i'm betting dnc fix july also feature candidate nights happen 
candidates split two groups higher polling lower each randomly across nights 
harris seems eaten entire first night bump also sanders gained somehow despite weak debate 
scroll see positive negative approvals candidate debates 
don't read much yet they updated second debate featured major candidates 
same lot happen vote primary ca warren bernie based pure alignment policies liz she seems getting momentum despite rather slow start campaign 
an issue bernie long time ideas passion he's best explaining thinking actual policy achieve warren excels people responding i'll forever grateful shifting debate left president need help country 
honestly gets repeated refrain fight that shit resonates better anything bernie says even agree when warren believe hope people see thing 
settle bernie ewar train bit seems like esque candidate specific policy positions better presentation ideas clear path implementation whole plan 
right people say biden choice bernie vice versa that shows nobody ideologically driven right deciding purely name recognition likely change soon 
sanders supporter glad warren us top polls it shows unequivocal progressivism way go forward america 
he pivoted economic without good segues constantly warren pivots econ less better she explains ideas repeats 
it really scary see left bernie's support makes single digits worry worst supporters 
damn kamala leapfrogged lost support nd th 
my honest reaction beto basically know year looked spoke debated like generic xx election democratic candidate completely unremarkable prepared anecdote every single response point felt less genuine flubbed opportunities stand pack the spanish moment stood odd fiancee's first language i'm fairly conversational speaking definitely sounded memorized phrases say rather trying learn legit plus confused panicked soon moderator started barely answered question even switching english cory booker's technically worse kind expected mayor nj opposed el paso politician really hear castro's enough able comment tbh 
think bad luck gave chance stage night there debates she'll mix joe bernie 
wish theyd begin narrowing think least small handful would addition subtraction 
sigh still seven months till iowa hopefully able keep momentum 
yes it's killed hillary general i'm makes she's would far better slogan even mean 
specially first debate biden bernie come well elizabeth lucky everyone talked second night 
would disagree hard definitely one shared ideology beat trump and believe they're best agree true respected that also something completely turned around time listening 
this good news i'd happy either potus prefer sanders 
it fine got benefit big dog stage calm collected sen harris battle plan much deeper field day also black person rewarded daring long slog keep enthusiastic warren see 
not surprising there's consistent gain couple percent super breakout moment harris flipped certainly flip back it's still positive interest 
spot beto speak spanish rehearsed much sounded like he understand moment passed also part mexican rolling eyes hard may damaged mean shits sake go ahead english no know impressed politicians busting we care my grandparents prefer these knobs trying relevant playing diverse cards thankfully people seem unpersuaded antics the ones polling best plans substance nonsense 
haven't heard take beto prepared much think spot wondering someone great town halls looked lost debate preparation makes sense 
the third debate happens september twice qualifying thresholds first two debates right predicting candidates qualify 
regardless someone supports bernie biden absolutely ideological consistency comes actual policy 
no mexican know impressed politicians busting spanish we care my grandparents prefer english think people last round tim kaine entire interview telemundo showed truly fluent but pulling random phrases way impress especially butcher anyways also remember marco rubio ted cruz fighting spanish election funny 
there absolutely reason value deciding someone else lack kind ideological values share choices tired attitude needs stop 
lol yeah legit spanish speaking still think unnecessary tell difference sure we know country live fine english one side family speaks tsalagi politicians never speak always within hahahaa forgotten cruz rubio trying cred excited see diverse candidates elected guy fresh sheet oi 
the commenter said ideological consistency values it insult directed towards biden supporters simple observation ideology two candidates quite different therefore individual willing support either reason likely due considerations 
no needs stop relativistic nonsense hold hands get along side some us voted iraq war supported integration others abdicated responsibility favor states' right racist you look two men opposite things say cares next name the time shut fall line after nominee chosen whole point primaries fight people think steer party wrong way 
exactly trying shame anyone saying policy ideology something people responding polls considering almost meaningless stage 
agree people cannot find ideologically similar think deeply bubble candidates get offended like also the ideological differences two definitely appear overblown simply want someone qualified improve health care raise minimum wage beat trump example they consistent people need bubbles stop thinking can't it help us 
man got year wrong lmaooo 
what kill count warren delaney ghost wants know 
it pretty clear spoken like long time thought going burst blood vessel his face turned several colors 
nothing says progressive like murdering billionaire live television 
mike choked hard warren question many ndas issued his expression priceless 
his reaction immediately made think watchpeopledieinside 
pete guy god fucking cojones liz beautiful see practically disemboweled 
it's updated and locked https imgur com akbayty png 
don't worry folks somebody kind enough correct record get year right https imgur com yfsxzur 
it amazing could hear testicles crushed debate 
we knew warren gonna drop hammer bloomy tonight she exceeded expectations 
that's second rich killed debate she's got touch 
warren sorry sorry bout said 
wouldn't funny actually turned dead 
pete buttigieg fan always love listening warren tonight pulling punches the supporter wants point made false claims great debate edit downvoted saying watch or misrepresented plan https apnews com daf dcaf ecb 
nah killed hard effectively balefire killing year past bloomberg he never launched presidential campaign 
for many us takes months stop accidentally writing last years date sympathize completely 
he rusty wd ready case 
there answer question make look awful lets run possible answers gives exact number not going good recall moment too many remember that private yes problem first place no 
believe also brought concept consensual regards ndas it part went ahead lost mind 
best part debate imo hope never let live that shit dark 
understand what signing nda anything 
except still said she'd support got nomination edit not sure i'm downvoted she literally immediately attacked rewatch tapes 
well would imagine record keeping local politicians robust experienced businessmen honest mistakes i'm sure 
so warren confirmed aes sedai blue ajah or nose thinking white personally 
the arrogance thinking saunter debate 
his lips pursing flapping beautiful moment 
they agreed agreement yes someone whose job income stake intimidated money felt choice sign wanted protect maybe like joke said ok tame let release hear let if something big planned nda guarantee workplace harassment discrimination serious issue glad warren called 
well technically nda agreement consensual but buying person's consent makes little iffy 
yeah one parties involved process mutibillionaire global media empire significant donor multiple campaigns think really consensual 
if history making sexually aggressive comments point enter multiple ndas significant skeletons closet pursued the democrats would better suited someone cleaner record warren inappropriate 
lets help make sure happen warren gets nomination 
literally everyone stage said they'll support nominee matter point another bloomberg included it's united trump general conceeding he's still got long way go towards getting nomination even longer liz tore tonight 
why bad thing the end goal get rid trump if means supporting bloomberg this way 
obviously grey ajah legal expert 
lemme jump fucking october neither yang delaney candidates least recognized needed get early build campaigns both together put effort bloomberg single afternoon as someone lived iowa caucused beyond insulting thinks blitz tv ads without foresight pushback 
for matter saying word consensual around topic sexual misconduct believe also made light casual sexism maybe like joke said that workplace sound nd best place work america 
wait basically harassing woman fought back forced sign nda discuss harassment why would anyone agree 
blue matter see someone pushing narrative sub downvote report 
ugh long confused whites greys most definitely grey 
as someone lived iowa unfortunately fortunately rest country everyone going care whole hell lot less giant cock year hopefully get put end line 
why would anyone agree they'll paid rather harassed slandered public life ruined 
he almost certainly paid sign nda 
essentially idea allegedly know certain since ndas keep us knowing committed acts sexual harassment victims sued in order make lawsuits threats go away offered amount compensation condition sign nda 
ah robert jordan books i've slowly buying find used book stores there's lot anxious start reading series 
an ajah every candidate warren grey duh bernie white never gets emotional stories consistently raising facts biden green given often apparently gotten many fights beaten getting back klob brown apparent lack social skills trivia knowledge minnesota like birth place post notes buttigeg red since even villain best make appear one steyer yellow debates heal everyone else's campaigns gabbard blue adventures conservative land putting heart media bloomberg black 
wouldn't public support you harass slander victim 
yeah they're good little slow parts great whole sanderson job finishing series jordan passed 
it great time start amazon tv adaptation currently filming 
dunno bernie seems much like blue and gabbard definitely black well 
they historically usually woman declared liar attempting ruin life great man see dr blasey ford recent example 
lol spend better part it's easy say light me too movement even people willing sling mud victims knows ndas signed bloomberg around long time i'm sure trail throughout career 
many victims get lambasted sections public harassed anita hill targeted gop media going clarance thomas sexually inappropriate actions towards 
wish case victims tend harassed slandered even they're making accusations private citizen make accusation someone powerful odds good humiliated national television receive mountains death threats assaulter's supporters in world rapists end convicted crimes https www washingtonpost com business less percent rapes lead felony convictions least face emotional physical consequences see many women decide want prolong trauma take buyout 
tried place everyone uniquely single ajah placed bernie blue originally justify placing gabbard white lol 
love last line people thing matters companies corporations this something feel gets forgotten field economics every the equations methodologies use equate transactions business positive true certain degree but can't assume growing gdp means standard living we need pay attention real world decisions effect that people look lives everyone especially worst system focus improving anything worth measuring measured one number 
miss able listen president speak feel embarrassed yes trump's rallies press conferences i'm junkie like reminds drastic difference calm safe inspired felt obama spoke opposed frustrated insulted almost every one performances audacity wear tan suit speaking whole nation future unity greatness trump grabs people peddling anger division hatred apathy i'm looking forward first speeches president warren way looks ice cold glass water day toiling heat georgian summer

it's amazing exchange recently reply hillary nominee winning votes somehow mean sexism magically exist still affecting society every level claim played part warren's campaign harris's gillibrand's williamson's klobuchar's disingenuous sexism issue period 
sexism bloomberg buttigieg booker end there's one winner cutthroat she made top someone lose needs stop whining 
sexism voters think candidates sexist 
most voters women vote warren who angry exactly why loathe question 
want and cynically hot goss everything wanted say shit primary campaigning 
oh god yes get warren 
was warren supporter bernie nofucksgiven one needed whole campaign think came late 
teared well her emotion sincere kind without giving fighter attitude she wonderful support whatever next 
me she inspired many hope see 
the snake emojis almost instantaneous believe bernie said lot tone deaf shit gender race gut reaction call liar gave benefit doubt assumed miscommunication sudden intense negative sexist smears warren maddening and bother demonstrably defending dropped long past point would meant anything 
that microcosm whole sexist environment live down believing man condemning woman ruining candidacy reputation calling snake liar how many women's words believed society over everything sexual discrimination harassment women suffer consequences dares speak and loses career sees dreams crushed while men lose nothing nothing mean establishes without doubt toxic sexism bernie camp moment including liberal use term said used defenders condone misconduct claiming summarily lie exaggerate make things reason even explain simple concept sister purports feminist woman's responsibility man's put context dig hole women responsible men's behavior come clean damn self 
the number supposedly woke progressives understand sexism astonishing almost joined sanders subreddits super tuesday get feel support they're packed much blatantly sexist vitriol i'm questioning even campaign worth getting behind 
if support bernie never cared progressive policies they act like bigger person even winning always victim every situation victims wrong and they're someone else must take blame might well woman that's cosmic scale bs 
saw nothing hypocrisy tribalism bernie supporters bout hard time believing taking place sub nobody spoke supporter's behavior especially mods action prevent brigading looks like i'll casting two lesser evils votes year 
that hurt it made realize progressive wing party significantly less claimed eager lot northern white people speak southern black folks 
my friends told would harder woman win trump due misogyny bernie say he'd right they offended suggested ultimately enabling sexism but it's true fuck 
it's baffling see also perfectly reinforces general environment left leaning politics pretends she confronted directly response recall and his supporters called liar public acted like well said that's guess 
the shitty bernie supporters suck they but please keep mind millions can't police personally he denounced internet still wild place appeals young punks grew online never engaged politics liz similar goals beg write campaign aims champion lot liz's platform assholes even hopeful energized people looking build better world 
she viciously attacked people asking support sexist manner everyone tried defend they blood without knowing anything actually went bernie liz everything power bury and blame even clarify said make effort condemn rabid base honestly parties refused back version conversation inevitably pit supporters it strategic mistake two come agreement the sexism happened inexcusable lot called team politics believing one side supported belief system 
is really sexist think people it's saying woman would lose failings failing others 
snake emoji toxic sexist what's harmful women biden supporting federal ban funding abortions don't let internet culture distract what's stake the choice clear 
my mom saying i've lost hope i'll see woman president lifetime told i'm starting wonder feels like we've got another century go point though encouraged least seems women running overall 
i'll give hint rhymes slexism 
it's crazy flaws fabricated amplified bernie shrugs heart attack biden looks terrible every time microphone rallies debates and thread version well campaign flawless can't say sexism 
rip unity gg trump sit back watch us tear apart 
probably vote anyway name printed ballot state votes may i'll whoever november can't bring either remaining candidates primary 
because years never woman president us women really matters 
you'd surprised learn multiple things cause problems sexism one 
internalized misogyny if grow society media government even friends family behaving lesser male counterparts psychological effect it's necessarily they're looking saying she's woman can't feeling like without able explain then people give reason justify that's reasoning realize 
angry sexist patriarchal society sexism ew woman vote it hm people want waste man and also like media coverage way women twice good half recognition also internalized sexism 
why would expect women vote they're shouldn't people based policy character etc gender 
two income trap helped understand financial crisis better years econ class 
no fucks given warren tore bernie followers lies bulleying supporters https www usatoday com story news politics elections elizabeth warren condemns bullying bernie sanders hope reconsider support 
it's hard get onboard people agree hold nose things say for progressiveness camp boasts followers every single campaign dropped scarily similar story getting harassed abused drove away someone they'd normally feel aligned 
warren specifically instructed campaigners hired treat others respect focus positivity campaign bringing bernie meanwhile people confrontational unliked like briahna joy gray david sirota the vitriol starts top guys course it'll permeate ranks would stand neither us 
if accuse conservative men sexist behavior they'll usually brush they really care but progressive called react much hostile manner since consider one good guys it's questioning core identity happens either introspect examine attitudes simply go cognitive dissonance route dig and greater part online community also digging reinforcing shared reality makes easier woman spreading lies totally acceptable post bunch snake emojis convinced neither supporters entitled respect cognitive hell drug 
it's hard need advance progressive agenda they're impossible work 
hell look post politics sub it claims results campaign nothing sexism 
bernie absolutely nothing like trump supporters surrogates really seem using playbook 
peaced forum saw someone sad warren's departure told check privilege you keep using word think means 
all bernie say intend imply said perceived way humbly apologize take moment reaffirm commitment gender equality politics bam done scandal call liar politically beneficial that knew would never vote primary he sacrifice anybody everybody sake 'movement' 
warren didnt leak repeatedly like yes happened important things focus my guess someone knows leaked thinking would help ever tried distance acknowledging truth 
understand supporters like must feel right blaming he clearly knew he's benefitting whole thing kept quiet could clarified said meant campaign put lot effort making stop can't describe hurtful used dealing toxic people online argue trump often end day silence vitriol base thought he'd able damaging women better support one win primary moving forward person think best character still left race 
well looks like biden supporters bernie somehow i've never seen behave large swaths bernie's every candidate shitty democratic base maybe worth asking 
mean think attitude comes though bernie constantly rails everyone everything big conspiracy defeat when that's candidate saying course supporters going toxic he denounce want he's reason toxicity first place 
love bernie people coming basically say notallmen it help 
as woman easy believe man said something thought neutral observation felt bad whiff sexism 
it's already confirmed intercept warren campaign leak comment strike timing calculated 
if excited run would choose yes obviously different time that's point conversation whether woman could beat trump to choosing despite knowing shows actually believe able would've backed endorsed hard believing campaign release story seems likely backfire like also sort raised automatically puts idea people's minds can't win even we're refuting that's brains work her remarks debate confirming happened calling bernie sexist she tried talk reason dug heels because outright denied it easy acknowledge thought sexism play election use moment pivot focusing creating society less exists instead ever said anything wrong made seem lied 
you know every chance clarify meant he kept quiet let base paint liar bury could profit 
it definitely sexist like hmm wonder worst parts everyone else gonna first 
we need people pontificating sexist racist use excuse support when happens back fight make happen regardless if enabling sexists racists women poc us saviors partners 
yeah years ago when y'all point stuff decades think making just women she people booed saying marched mlk 
so called planned parenthood establishment fighting good see even old guys change views 
here go this evidence warren snake do know harvey weinstein considers feminist 
so marched around sign one day years stood supporters maligned snake insults that oldest worst fundamental symbol misogyny women cynically benefited never ever forget 
mean calling woman snake definitely misogynistic undertones it's ok recognize still think bernie better candidate women 
pretty sure democrats united bernie democrat never tried help natural allies charge 
this super weird example know better ones stay consider arrowverse they're hokey poorly written tv shows consistently batwoman supergirl surprise black lightning get absolutely dog piled if point rt scores result misogyny people say no show stop blaming sexism everything okay well the flash arrow legends tomorrow but white dude lead disproportionate amount hate every perceived flaw two things true it's possible warren run completely perfect way campaign and needed overcome mountain left right misstep chance pounce one runs bernie heart attack biden angrily yelled voters town halls debate performance bunch goose eggs end day prepared candidate intellectual leader democratic party hardest working person politics lost two spectacularly flawed old men ran safe embrace

strategic politics fact racist using racial animus make political moves still see also nixon's southern strategy 
considering democrats racked largest midterm victory percentage past hundred years think telling racists racist effects independent voters swung towards trump successfully painted moderate things like lgbt issues economic ones independents swinging way becomes clear he's right wing authoritarian suburban shift away republicans begun intensified may well prove decisive

your comment removed don't all lives matter topic trans women murdered 
see co sponsor https www congress gov bill th senate cosponsors party democratic 
she longer co sponsoring thought legislation died back 
comes across concern trolling tbh 
it's true it endangers countless women mostly marginalized ones without helping anybody in fact took law enforcement's strongest ally sex workers witness trafficking made lives many much dangerous difficult instead cooperating that bill literally opposite needed combat 
love for post million reasons stay fierce stay safe 
that's according post history he's andrew yang supporter says donald trump second choice president he's definitely concern troll 
awww thanks love probably lol 
elizabeth warren is winning over left wing hearts in iowa 
really hope biden's pace slow may change mind presidency give spotlight eli instead 
can confirm am iowan like lot candidates still go see people come town warren already 
it's amazing see warren gaining strong traction i've always liked felt even months ago possible way progressive woman ever sniff nomination it seems quite promising she's genuine person great ideas move country forward already support 
iowa election caucus voter registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
concerned relationship military industrial complex willingness take big money general 
i'm pretty sure slowing continue every time opens mouth 
it's unlikely warren win iowa second place finish ahead bernie would shocker that's i'm hoping it'll give early momentum 
goes back sure who's polled consistently going biden lot early numbers inflated pacs lobbyists put money behind influence donors 
can please elaborate i'm sure referring 
https projects fivethirtyeight com polls president primary eh warren's creeping looks like even biden's bump settling he's still far head 
can't believe he's calling uncle joe ultimate cringe edit drunk realize parody ignore 
in home state pretty close military contractors said taking big money general election win primary downvote want still facts like warren overall right behind sanders 
it's attack site joe biden's campaign page 
for real this time hardly anyone knew name obama 
https fivethirtyeight com features analyzed years primary polls even early theyre fairly predictive however i'm hopefully given warren's standing half year could one four remaining candidates then think she'd shine worried field big 
exactly at point years ago jeb leading candidate 
here warren's interview tyt said she'd take big money general election https twitter com theyoungturks status she voted twice increase trump's military budget www leftvoice org elizabeth warren votes massive war 
work reply briefly stuff interview young turks said history mass googled real quick sure already done since asking 
the big field going begin dwindling soon enough considering threshold qualifying debates get higher time all idiots ego runs forced drop sooner later able sustain much longer 
yeah trump declared june th lead pretty early two weeks declaring top half polls one month non stop minus carson blip fall source https projects fivethirtyeight com election national primary republican 
how many times bernie sanders voted increase military budget course career 
he never led polls establishment favorite 
https projects fivethirtyeight com election national primary polls republican trump lead pretty early two weeks declaring top half one month non stop minus carson blip fall 
sure would like know bernie definitely anti imperialist he however vote no three trump's military budgets 
mean declare half way june within two weeks popping top one month constantly by mid july would never leave save polls favoring carson fall 
jeb already losing half polls june even trump declared carson rubio beating times walker think 
i'm voting democrat wins ticket warren slowly becoming favorite her policy point 
warren right can't wait around year half we losing actual republic daily barr order every justice employee including mueller still payroll testify congress therefore rule law know senate impeach uh value forcing republicans fight impeachment battle let's get faces sue administration subpoenas double emoluments lawsuits draft articles he's committed offenses nothing russia booted office force several fronts 
same her corruption policies would go long way addressing actual issues country outside fundamental problems within constitution 
i'm sick squishy middle wayers rock elizabethwarren 
think early support biden less committed people beating trump advocating favorite uniting behind eventual winner can't mutually exclusive 
big bernie supporter but wanted warren run i've fanboy since watched lecture the coming collapse middle class well worth hour time 
this i'm right well looking strictly policy leadership warren way front there's factors think long time primaries kick consequential progressive wide margin still undecided back election sort dream scenario kind bonkers polling higher 
even biden vote blue matter personally i'm warren bernie front runners 
honestly jeb bush ran democrat somehow every democratic voter got brain damage primary he'd vote but i'm exact boat love warren inspiration think good ideas great intentions 
i'm voting either warren bernie whoever leading vote cause want one win 
not sure understand said title though like thinking 
if optimist would say gravel since i'm equally happy either warren sanders 
hoping warren stays senate actually write law biden sanders would much rather liz president 
this feel if impeach within month may want say week i'll resonable lost complete faith system voted blue wave the democrats anything kinda sitting hands result thing happened care nots popular atm senate wont jack shit impeach 
think i'm still going vote sanders honestly i'd support warren ticket anymore superior long term view country close short it's little disappointing concerned fact we're losing corruption equally refreshing willing come strongly issue 
legit unironic centrist elizabeth warren preferred candidate we need someone pulling leftward position bring country back center 
biden support middle age older democrats they get board crazy youngins if ask questions without buzzwords tend agree warren bernie polarizing policy beat well thought possible pipe dream unfortunately lot people vote based 
this early support viewed polls really name recognition 
even tulsi i'd vote blue trump 
i'm trying think someone worse trump hard time roy moore alabama guess hardcore religious fundamentalist country it's scary 
so strategy perspective think way pelosi somewhat slow rolling point maximum damage trump the goal either get enough evidence republicans choice convict senate go gone record voting acquit criminal president longer drawn gop propping that makes flipping senate next year possible she probably begin impeachment hearings eventually help cause fail yet impeachment starting fall prediction 
sorry questions centrist i've met months right wing disguise 
centrist according axis are socialist capitalist 
idk yet prolly gonna make mind dnc debate bu preference either warren buttigieg 
pelosi senate house long strategic i'll extremely disappointed impeachment proceedings begin though it screw republic edit thanks stranger 
hey what happened last time conviction failed oh that's right republicans gained full control government edit changed impeachment 
yeah fault pelosi taking route makes lot sense but warren right ethical issue ethics wait strategy as long trump dinner point eventually heels responsible crimes i'm fine either outcome 
think strategy way trump supporters blind anything support point view if house impeaches senate acquits huge exonerated system tested came top to people follow politics closely win maga democrats want give opportunity 
encourage people donate shahid buttar chipped he running pelosi election we need leaders moral clarity shown time she like old guard democrats stuck era political theater world changed around needs go 
it good one uses political labels consistently anymore economic centrist believe free market capitalism combined robust public institutions social welfare regulations all great programs western europe financed thriving capitalist markets creates positive feedback loop large tax revenues get reinvested turn highly productive 
it's worth remembering center us much right rest developed world also consider centrist international standards american politics means want move left we're nation universal healthcare actually considered controversial example the notion freedom includes families going broke can't pay medical bills would laughably extremist mention immoral literally every single advanced democracy 
to clear pelosi house senate 
just clear i'm saying may fail it done regardless love liz vanguard however think people expect instantaneous frustrated slow burn pelosi wants cut case possible less safe districts confident vote impeach hurt used republican house members get even bigger wave 
which actually long term creates even revenue companies involved if america hell bent getting money rich guys also making bottom layer tad richer lesser evils or could convince big sitting hoarding bad but like dream 
think apologize snarkiness comment i'm getting fed junk democrats burned impeachment conviction fails plus process really like minute thing the trial go months stories continue come starting take notice warren she afraid speak mind made pointed comments generation took surprise you faith speaker house pretty sure speaker came lies weapons mass destruction iraq bush seriously doubt she'll impeach her recent discouraging say least impeaching encourage

bad bernie supporters raking coals statement last night already labelled war enabler in world it always seems like two candidates fairly line differences syntax 
wag dog the idiot's favorite movie 
senator warren touched first thought heard go nuclear deal working the facts clear iran agreement intended jeremy ben ami president moderate pro israel group street said statement oct acting based personal political agenda distaste diplomacy contempt predecessor congress see decision reckless mistake makes harder easier confront prevent obtaining weapons https www npr org trump put iran limbo refusing certify url 
the trolls twitter horrendous wanted reply tweets want toxic

forreal though vote sanctions iran constituted first violation deal 
that's folks apparently rule thumb let embassies get overrun allow people killed like benghazi downvote away unsubbing anyway 
the whole point war win election and loses hands disaster dems glad speaking 
like bernie warren following republican narrative bad guy instead pointing fought isis mistake 
it's partisan attack chapo types read statements people podcast made openly gleefully acting bad faith mock anyone idea discussing things good civility nerds we need push back narratives talking directly waste time 
they'll anything push cult leader regardless intellectual dishonesty harm party it end electing biden bernie stagnant since beginning they've torn everyone else alienating supporters process 
uhhhh yes at least friends maybe picking natural static tension whole debacle people choose intentions though always kind 
do favor read twitter comments or politico youtube 
were tho because always war iran warning trump trying it's enough say want conflict must make one less likely congress clear authorized we work allies deescalate tensions create space diplomacy can't afford another forever https twitter com ewarren status 
instead show understands side's position emotions even disagrees since president she'll responsible americans show one time trump go ahead one tweet rally loud disjointed interview front helicopter instance he's 
trump needs admitted psychiatric hospital worlds good not disappointed mrs warren 
totally disagree drawing contrasts especially terrible decision politics 
there big difference protecting embassies assassinating another country military leaders hope see 
apparently rule thumb let embassies get overrun allow people killed like benghazi where suggest do think options pre emptive strikes could start another war letting and know why happened because republican controlled congress time refused provide security clinton withstood straight hours testimony walked away blood gop hands you previously stated left party maybe it'll take awhile adjust views clear democrats nuanced going black white decisions statements issues complicated tend talk absolutes no one suggesting attacked i'm gonna downvote want really engage political discussion need established facts warren dem saying patently true 
it sad day indeed one decided leave us let's honor brokebutnotdefeated stroll memory lane the following links lead brokebutnotdefeated's mvp moments elizabethwarren top submissions you extending solvency social security two decades http np reddit com comments pdwo if follow please respect rules vote threads 
try let downvotes criticism persuade another candidate people care passionately warren bit fault times take supporter regularly gets downvoted it's ok agree everything still think best field also supporters representatives anymore 
the first part statement mentioned soleimani murderer they say mentioning justifying trump actions which completely stupid opinion 
no saying true one follow another there lot bad people world many positions power doesn't mean lob missile 
it narrative man unquestionably bad person he may useful ally daesh suddenly absolve things quds force command americans died actions took muslims across me decision made at point becomes calling spade absolutely republican talking the actual killing going prevent war carried future death that part spin bullshit his can't recognize difference literal fuck 
my problem opposing war principle the critiques importance congressional authorization cost etc rather arguing get us sucked another iraq vietnam warren comes around stronger statement post getting called 
campaign chair deb haaland would like word uninformed ass 
it's nuanced position course loudest bernie supports can't understand 
lot people like seeing things black white little know negative view someone mean wish death especially way could get mindset not everything 
well yes attacking completely stupid murderer lol it like perfect upstanding citizen 
ah yes let's go plan get labeled terrorist sympathizers instead that's winning strategy sure 
bernie fails purity test voting aumf barbara lee congressional rep voted this tests work babs running 
so wanted tack war hell see principle difference statements expect made different events points escalation bernie exact grievances https www span org video user clip bernie sanders expresses concern bombing iraq face executive office making acts without congress approval this extremely unpopular americans foreignpolicy com killing suleimani iran tension trump fault nothing last decade cured fatigue iran would something really stupid rouse support ground invasion no endless wars argument big reason trump got popular people thought anti interventionist talked talk generals put head could hero her principles lead introduce bill first candidate commit use prioritizing diplomacy building diversifying state department discussions conflict focused humanitarian toll damage us disregards huffpost entry elizabeth warren national security 
the cost war death people like deliberately misunderstanding simple statement holding standards never apply bernie 
so tell pointing recklessness consequences trump's actions breeding greater division it's like attacking supporters people pretty thrilled prospect another war why always democrats get criticized dividing country reaching understand disagree meanwhile i've mentioned cant point single time trump republican lately thing unite 
it's difficult believe actually came democratic candidate sub surprised calling criticizing trump divisive downvoted the downvote feature people contributes discussion may sincere comment beyond bounds expected discourse surprising think elevating topic worthwhile and note explicitly community supporters us senator elizabeth warren clearing house critics air complaints we try avoid creating echo chamber we're moderating coming pretend democrats treat respect actions throughout last three years never going get traction purpose 
bush murderer obama trump it mean totally ok assassinate that's like people calling comes believing killing americans serious crime middle easterners big deal regrettable necessity 
he angel give break this rhetoric got us war iraq take saddam hussein 
going twitter shitposting high ranking official government assassinated nothing escalate things rationalize legitimize attack it pretty bad response rightly criticized 
you understand republicans already matter say call us socialists terrorist sympathizers traitors pinko commies derogatory thing think they called obama things even launching drone assassinations killing bin laden it good rhetorical strategy craft language attempt stave kinds inevitable attacks we need firm unequivocally opposed nonsense there plan concoct result gop accusing democrats it's get nuance simply strengthen argument legitimacy attack whatsoever even subtle ways 
and note explicitly community supporters us senator elizabeth warren clearing house critics air complaints yes like two commentators disappointed path heading if wants win election type rhetoric going cut with used obviously trying democrat alienating us respect president united states 
soleimani 'murdered' iranians civilians middle eastern countries he terrifying force region side the iranian me diaspora shedding tears see but that's condoning us trump 
mr speaker saddam hussein brutal dictator overthrown and ability make weapons destruction must eliminated https www span org video user clip bernie sanders expresses concern bombing iraq bernie 
recognizing murderers bad fair response 
oh fucks sake the guy commander fucking quds forces if think saying bad somehow means supports assassination seriously need rethink positions 
you comparing warren putting public statement shitposting proof twitter completely ruined form discourse what guy state secret it fucking wikipedia say someone decides google knowing nothing asks sanders is supposed respond lie exactly position the argument murderer already purpose would ignoring serve people start asking 
you're mixing republicans independents republicans sure think right leaning literally one making play republican base 
no criticizing warren's remarks please explain divisive or someone point reckless actions president hopefully soon running fear somehow offending 
yes supporters like gonna stop right takes two clicks make clear just gotta click name see post history boy fun commentators link sorry it's trust think full shit cursory glance comment reinforces and also if wants win election type rhetoric going cut what the kind points trump that called divisive ummm mean guess obviously trying democrat how dare heavens forbid tries democrats democratic primaries so wild alienating us respect president united states hmmm all country point bet really respected obama 
specifically said murderer sufficient cause assassinating someone 
and think clearly wrong say do warren's statement 
sure want help create excuse legitimize attack oversimplifying complex situation 
read everything said come conclusion dumb thing say 
right leaning independents going vote warren stop caring anyone right thinks anything we need care rallying left traditionally when give false narrative credence even slightly makes seem like valid position no wing positions they wrong everything one possibly morals policy understanding history science altering cultural soup swimming influence time that done absolutely dominating media narratives around acceptable insane and elections getting folks 
please explain divisive trump's actions put every service member diplomat risk no elizabeth iran's he's marching toward war iran since first days office us we're accident reckless president maybe referring president last one cannot stress enough enemy trump these three statements sow division 
removed trolling selectively ignoring person replied said that's condoning us trump act like they're favor assassination trying good faith discussion 
it seems like oversimplifying complex situation though 
right rather say nice man assassinated instead he piece shit human we go war iran these mutually exclusive positions 
want help create excuse legitimize attack oversimplifying complex situation this ridiculous take you realize nothing democrat says go without criticism right right so accepting fuck even talking democrats can't understand sentences making two distinct points the statement fucking stupid anyone criticizing acknowledging different critics would've said sympathizing murderer either genuine idiot completely disingenuous 
become dumb thing say i'm tired people claiming he bad person that's mean killed killing even table saying accurate statement 
and elections left getting folks vote please show election true 
no elizabeth iran's actions put every service member diplomat risk are pretending action increase armed forces diplomatic personnel already region well potential start somehow even worse war middle east iran marching toward us like omitted key part particular tweet in beginning term trump abandoned agreement keeping becoming nuclear power also easing sanctions improving relations here's kicker both allies intelligence services agree abiding terms maybe referring president last one cannot stress enough enemy relations they certainly stable then took started us path we're just clear idea divisive anything might run contrary says gosh wonder anyone since apparently pointing darn mean huh 
i'll admit came bit heated it tends frustrate get called divisive audacity question god emperor party it's happened enough little patience ruder intended apologize and found one past comment sort supporting warren really square initial comments attacked rightly criticizing trump's actions she's candidate opposing election criticizing policies big part so support trump how work the two almost completely diametrically opposed he represents corruption wants eliminate 
saying play talking points used legitimize attack actually think wrong us assassinate wasnt handled properly if intentions condemn stop escalations calling murderer terrorist going help anything 
dumb statement contextually politically real consequences instigate iranians 
if sex worker killed undercover cop could see people would mad first thing said obviously illegal work bad starting statement victim blaming makes pretty clear might okay outcome method the big outstanding question whether warren others think murderer good assassinated and yes there's reason protesting regime droned it matters respond annoyed bernie saying war iraq waste taxes killing troops opposed hundred thousand million destabilizing countless 
turn around think mbs horrible human does mean condone assassination these sort simplistic hot takes work one actually thinks it basically comes criticism messaging rather morality even idea hardline refusal speak ill target would somehow percolate actionable change political action silly real hardcore stuff totally warrants getting juvenile internet fight 
listening middle easterners neocon discussion points kid my post response american lives part it erases overwhelming majority victims if actually care peoples middle east erase pain situation many happy he's dead wish taken instead 
saying play talking points used legitimize attack actually think wrong us assassinate wasnt handled properly when asked came conclusion initial comment know got because nonsense argument sanders supporters claiming twitter day bad person if can't call leader quds forces get fuck political discussions this complete you condemn these mutually exclusive positions matter much guys whine enough please 
so said instead and also supposed honest party the republicans tell lie are say good person no that's nonsense 
criticizing trump's actions thing making enemy pointing bad things divisive rhetoric linked identity poll numbers perception whether he's good president sad existence indeed she example said everyone voted trump mouth breathing troglodyte that would so also anyone voting can't say who's got 
new poll finds majority americans across political spectrum back warren's ultra millionaire tax 
just need people make first choice second we rank voting 
when asked comment americans responded simply saying shit in sarcastic tone billionaires publicists admit displeased 
ok two serious questions is wealth tax constitutional could ever get passed congress full disclosure warren number candidate like many ideas concerned please kind responses asking voter trying become informed troll 
we need hammer wealth tax taxing wealth differs earned income 
think better second rd place polling warren started receive less negative attention seen past days positive coverage 
love idea principle real concerns effectiveness tax practise yang's vat seems practical effective warren would hear official response critisms suround wealth beyond mug billionaire tears 
why wealth tax better vat 
did mention trump's original wealth tax even steep changed minds info tucker carlson people claiming stole trump's idea shameless 
it constitutional the founders country wealth tax obvious definition taxable much broad centuries ago american bar association https www americanbar org groups taxation publications abataxtimes home aug pp johnson good job explaining please look google com amp nytimes business economy politics survey html sizable majority republicans support vast independents democrats this isolated poll credible ever found last year america either party opposed wanna stress warren popularity seems in rust belt michigan wisconsin pennsylvania especially newsweek elizabeth warren surpasses joe biden key states famp people want candidate pro labor working class genuinely think win probably florida well she also shocking appeal may medicare all anti corruption bill passed social spending go without ballooning debt so definitely beat trump general election as winning back senate getting agenda congress large difference obama bernie drop activism become president like hating liked lot clear contrast that means maintaining campaigns external pressure held accountable fight policies popular moreover despite pete joe portraying divisive actually many bipartisan credentials worked everyone ted cruz lindsey graham lisa murkowksi many others get signed law even republican could although honestly know issue chances taking nominee favorability among democratic electorate unequivocal winner terms combined first second choice voters fires excite base turning 
why would constitutional in highest tax rate even ended paying approximately as whether passed largely depends election results democrats could conceivably take senate help lot if republicans keep control imagine we'll see mcconnell's legislative graveyard 
please consider liz number rather aspirational dreams start concede middle end 
wealth tax necessary hard implement we germany til caused lot trouble though worked less wouldn way higher taxation capital gains similar effect 
it depends who's sitting supreme court my guess would find legal framework allow actually based precedent set eminent domain seizure land property public interest combined taxation authority unlike traditional expectation direct compensation pass senate view even democratic party retakes control enough red purple state moderate senators likely feel bridge far vote republicans stands better chance house sure whether speaker want force colleagues cast votes something could hurt next election chamber may depend heavily warren leans pelosi even consider wants invest political capital essentially push people much many issues president lose halo given winning poor chances becoming law staying 
oh yeah constitutional sure give proceeds states per capita basis recall 
while true many ideas plans would flimsy time passing current congress ask questions want person right might happen wrong decision really it minds making when novel issue comes mind responding the one good meh 
think concerns allayed taking closer look plan sounds rude meant know else say lmao her impose new tax nowhere she builds the first step putting billions back irs reforming way act evasion cracked rich people like jeff bezos pay literally zero taxes etc collecting money issue settles opinion really avoiding problems wealth europe get around warren gets issues specifically informed failure if billionaire ultramillionaire tries renounce citizenship make fortunes exempt exit go extremely high yang's vat makes sense but imposing enforcing less difficult difference far not hating yang love objections also practicality rather rationality believe either done without large enforcement two moreover immensely popular administration wall street figures running shots trump another huge reason avoidance increasing largely current appetite wealthy definitely would 
because th amendment says following the congress shall power lay collect taxes incomes whatever source derived without apportionment among several states regard census enumeration it give federal government explicit permission tax wealth property income 
guess mean double taxation issue these income taxed previously it argument heard really sure constitutional vs law so far favor eliminated capital gains tax everything proper rate like concept wealth skeptical plans warren put pass especially seems linch pin else do think could senate majority run democrats small margin ideas good direction want country go along im looking ability progress happen can stepped approach better 
the wealth tax popular even republicans it's likely improve favorability conservatives decrease 
if apply tax based whether someone health insurance absolutely million dollars assets 
there already exists property tax though different 
the constitution also allow president appoint cabinet that's legal expected every administration worked since washington exhaustive list government cannot 
the american bar association disagrees https www americanbar org groups taxation publications abataxtimes home aug pp johnson wealth tax constitutional 
we tax kinds things twice your salary taxed paid sometimes locally addition federally buy often business pays taxes money gave the wealth constitutionally questioned federal level there's unclear wording direct historically people seem see hard most country already pay form property largest asset falls disproportionately middle class rather ultrawealthy 
dont think taxed twice much highest tax bracket taxes increased right 
the constitution gives congress power tax it political judgment constrained legal norms similar president foreign policy judiciary interpreting law constitutional 
my feeling popular moderates conservatives time congress votes right media republican party blue dog dlc democrats similar dark money groups really made opposition attempt cast negative light change public opinion strong focus yet they probably candidate supports variation warren sanders two know though may takes commanding lead primary delegates becomes nominee president once like pour advertising editorializing popularity certain likely disappear folks remember happened hillarycare universal healthcare plan developed hillary clinton bill clinton's behest early years administration met flood advertisements influencing elements funded health insurance industry opposing towards pass democratic even gotten vote despite proposal people propagandized relatively new subject judge little often favor something initially this sometimes changes learn aka favorite outlets political figures trash russians troll farms thing billionaires air internet sponsored stories expect bunch lobbyists pounding door warnings donors unaffiliated election campaigns support well i'm saying way things work additionally small majority wins senate include joe manchin others genuinely oppose sort principle one might add no right the odds voting astronomically low 
actually funny enough kavanaugh released opinion claimed described basically constitutional wouldn't surprised becomes issue next years trump's shitty federalist society judges 
so anything goes either side gets majority votes sounds like good system i'm sure turn well 
no calvin johnson john kipp chair corporate business law university texas disagrees hence wrote publication obviously supreme court would weight 
manchin expressed opposition progressive policies i'm aware speaking wealth tax he voted trump's cut favored wealthy heavily even accounting degree propaganda move needle objectively much popular republicans support instead that's huge cost purple democrat especially democratic constituents moving direction 
also bill barr preaching unilateral executive authority long democrat federalist society 
'good says elizabeth warren after billionaire right winger peter thiel she's democrat he is 'most scared by'

reading the last decade american history one could genuinely optimistic politics since vast increase welfare beneficiaries extension franchise women two constituencies notoriously tough libertarians rendered notion capitalist democracy oxymoron source https www cato unbound org peter thiel education libertarian pretty sure he's record continuing dialogue things like able vote mistake he openly wants world rich men say anything make whether folks realize enemy preferred part not quite i've read right what saying authentic freedom goal precondition highest good libertarianism describes authentic women dislike libertarianism those make nonviable democratic elections therefore ultimately incompatible and goes talk despair dead end democracies know they pursue truly free places naming cyberspace outer space seasteading think abandoned nbsp it's little silly found funny echoes frustrations left frequently go similar directions like shit fucked live people stupid disagree philosophies when money possibly ever spend what's next power this drug types money first kind power got hooked after awhile high tolerance much throwing million around comes far forms beyond though basic token 
california election primary voter pre registration deadline http registertovote ca gov february www sos elections voter registration vote mail apply march general november 
umm he's going sue death you know right seriously though truly awful person 
bernie great baggage heavy really expanding base support seems 
this best example bernie entire webpage listing dozen anti endorsements billionaires 
one billionaire total good faith sure says scared warren face progressive wing sorry that's stretch she's even member cpc if put endorsements our revolution side see ton overlap all congressional candidates scouted later endorsed even vocal well known progressives us house the squad active bernie organizers justice democrats organization started ardent sanders supporters still big day so exactly done earn title progressive what policy agenda brought spotlight elevated mainstreamed years ago 
also late basically peak post civil war racist oppression especially wilson making segregation official federal policy in terms personal freedom speech press association even firearms far free these libertarians measure rich white man 
jesus he's terrible even imagine does realize neck slices way whether rich poor there going back madman thinking remotely possible 
during debate hear new ideas bernie abstract talking points liz really seem like steps beyond ready go make changes reality 
the word socialism baggage comes along heavy old people vote old trained like regardless actually means 
and constant drip negative media coverage think important things left news war violence senseless tragedy country inflicts people billions poor many fellow americans trying eek living ugly climate future we're facing you think purpose maybe get viewers maybe sell ads but random then put context democratic primary know i'm saying it's food thought guess 
honest question actually think trolling warren sub going make people want vote sanders instead 
that something struck went second debate hoping wowed sanders felt like bit broken record while advocating hugely important feel needs ideas least another way talk 
the stump speech fine particularly kind empty questions really stumbles pulls relation social justice not everything class turning sexism racism conveys idea things matter 
he absolutely refused pinned policy specifics really turned say someone voted primary 
think need new ideas none old implemented yet those still priority 
as former sanders voter sanders' call movement attracted lots people interested winning conception argument missing inclusively policy legislative feasibility one win election 
care honest can't let garbage take like go without getting word interesting nobody even acknowledged single point made answered question 
was ever chance warren's support fluid diverse actual supporters sub open shifting vote sanders primary small minority think i'm saying anything profound that's nature things right 
bernie supporters insist consistency virtue rather boring know stump heart feels like there's personality 
think there's whole lot fluidity still one going win nomination without bringing voters point supported someone else but trolling another candidate's subreddit likely harden people candidate support reverse and gaining votes sub question come just argue fun 
as someone bernie close second choice voted wrong 
reasons argument good thing right we keep sacred able agree much through learn things correct misconceptions refine understanding want live echo chamber how else grow improve communication skills you see works presume others get similar benefit like america reddit community hello neighbor thanks engaging this sub engages sortof truth told lot purposeful disengagement unspoken strategy maybe dual facet on one hand discuss rally it's really hard watch inconsistency people raise banner progressivism give bernie death thousand pithy passive aggressive cuts mean last week warren headlining per ticket convention net roots meanwhile side town protesting hospital closure raising funds squad representatives took principled stance detention center policy yet clearly becoming new face progressive wing party little dissent upvotes counting i'm sure someone take issue that's and getting wrong progressive anyway sense supporters totally clear stands there's discussion the day supporter called crazy saying taxing find fascinating think world view anyway could go time shut eye said thanks 
like arguing dislike misinformation sub fun debate training grounds no one owes engagement enter discussion create argument that's frequently pattern sanders supporters follow coming there's real reason us continually engage next batch crusaders trying find ever smaller wedge demonstrate bernie really progressive why people almost definition open changing mind 
argument good thing right we keep sacred able agree much there ways challenge viewpoint straight arguing methods likely win lot people you're wrong the candidate support actually terrible this guy way better especially subredddit dedicated 
there's lot unpack i'll say think there's obligation engage anyone certainly find measure joy meaning hopefully connect another thinking human conversation and enough one want speak others looking ever smaller wedge issues demonstrate bernie progressive sometimes observe unassailable opinion statements different question worth less somehow this whole thread started someone said warren becoming new face wing old peter thiel made anti endorsement followed subtle yet abstract cuts ranging baggage ideas personality boring liz lock plans policies do let go is invitation respond if disagree situation you read becomes moments it mighty tempting lay comment trolling 
sorry maybe i'm getting little confused ways talking isn't challenging viewpoint definition argument yeah appreciate one opinions either everyone lesser 
none moral turning point demanding action but actually going change minds anyone thinks bernie's run leaves baggage warren better progressive leader there's objective truth things progressivism larger one group candidate people different opinions and end entering someone else's space start argument feed need within yeah that's trolling 
mean probably semantics anything but definitely possible open honest discussion something without arguing arguing relies less saying person wrong people no one wants truly confront moment better way would question position assumptions share opinions changing minds opens room if going change mind anyway 
it's anonymous reddit commentary the threshold demanding action think concede pretty low anyway disagree comments weight particularly people hash second tier preferences also even vote based arguments heard rather fashion opinions deeply held preexisting beliefs rationale comes fact find science bears so like changing minds altering gut check instincts those erode trust on last point want speak would describe sub safe space or maybe debate okay outsiders welcome participate mean say things there's objective truth progressivism larger one group candidate going differing can't

maybe win presidential seat hire agree good ideas 
yang gang classical liberal leaning used really like warren early career especially ows days she even subject picked grad school speech writing class but since keeps looking least business usual disguised progressive change her signature selling points i've got plan that keep unimpressed plans one big ones student loan debt plan talking point race largely two fold free public education year colleges wiping universities running numbers private one time forgiveness help anyone enrolls yr university happen teach gross what's students accumulating right i'm probably klobuchar though vote late state plenty decide impressed klobuchar's platform either think much better chance uniting different factions democrats well many moderates going alienate 
outlasting mean shit john delaney outlasted lot people well 
we're happy y'all look around maybe check warren's site ready importantly ask questions join us discussions 
welcome yang sweetheart i'm kind sad last poc race

even though warren candidate start i'm grateful yang ran he brought serious otherwise ignored issues political race when candidates future elections talking addressing automation ubi person need thank hope stop advocating 
remaining candidates go warren far away best chance keeping yang's ideas conversation getting onto platform ends general collaborator listens co signs good need signal boosting possibly diverse collection endorsements high profile campaign chairs candidate already made overtures yang similar castro would extremely surprised bring board super tuesday 
love andrew yang yanggang i'm sorry hear he's campaign please take look elizabethwarren com consider joining warren community very welcoming lovely ppl co moderate group pet lovers for warren join us twitter facebook you welcome we'd fight along side big structural change again he missed feel confident heard last 
the futurist likes ubi wonk really liked democracy dollars warren something would effectively similar anti corruption plan messaging dd much cleaner 
hope runs office new york think could win 
cool hear liz top choice lfg 
understand yang warren makes think biden good person 
you think bernie good person 
wait think bernie good person like even ted cruz said last election honest running edit y'all dense i'm saying anything nice recognizing notable opponent compliments 
she win people vote we two tiny states thing lot happen june the biggest test campaign performs march rd until going worry 
bernie strong front runner right think warren still path victory klobuchar good ground game enough money run ads next states we're weeks super tuesday buttigieg poc support wins nv sc he's enjoyed iowa nh biden's keeps slipping firewall seems precarious best if biden continues slip infrastructure compete can't get go maybe sanders likely she least she's position well lot candidates one lone survivors past become unity candidate win as rd delegates going hard time maintaining that's they've articulated seems smart https medium com teamwarren look ahead 
imma real think candidate gonna win delegate majority almost given point brokered convention dnc happen definitely it'll come biden bernie warren when narrow probably around ish support em so like better two vote 
freedom dividend also really great branding 
yang candidate real presence neighborhood besides bloomberg buy way sad castro booker dropped candidates supported warren think would campaign ended funny thing liked stance nuclear power impressed lonely support persuaded ubi efficient effective policy approach issue trying address happy finally discussion though appreciated contribution 
it's great candidates necessary fit mold might bring interesting innovative ideas table that's liked yang 
awww make lot sense together really glad positive spaces talk candidates this race gotten negative 
booker yang what got one debates talked people spoke town halls often small business owners wanted democrats need stop focusing much they're taking money focus going make people's lives better 
agreed we need many progressives pushing overton window left 
it good policy grab attention cool ones never really got mentioned general public would hear personally liked democracy dollars lot seemed like clever way approach citizen's united problem warren's something effectively similar anti corruption plan think yang better messaging talk 
everyone that's politics felt deflation feel there's something candidates democrat primary wins live florida currently pretty devastated nelson lost senate seat rick scott voldemort aka skeletor gillum gubernatorial bid trump troll got office literally woke morning elections cereal rum it sucks but think yang would want gang sit idly this election important and he'd proud did accomplish candidate rose obscurity getting every country thinking ubi as move forward questions warren we'll happy answer 
bernie strong he's og real deal but prefere warren cycle it's policies tremendously different they're really there's nuance way alike far apart signature issues for like built plans offered way and afraid use every lever power available create changes need couple favorite examples she'll executive orders lower drug prices right away expand medicare she's got plan bill would require congressional approval nuclear first strike means worry much future incompetent president nuking someone nowhere imagine cheetoh benito nuked solemani removing filibuster get narrow majority senate could pass major legislation as know candidate favor ideas she also gets shit done spearheaded consumer financial protection bureau even congress one believe best actually implementing lot big whole progressive movement wants 
yeah that's delaney refused close shop yang one exception kind bs kept making debate stage doing meant ideas policies taken seriously anything ever said 
her support slight lean towards younger age categories unlike biden sanders heavy toward respective ends consistently second highest polling college students 
coming someone probably thinks old mean much 
very sad really liked appreciated yang gang hate white slate 
really know history would love hear 
aussie worry shits bit fucked right people like rest democratic gang going fine make sure one two actual candidates get nom 
early debates always refreshing takes issues would put conversation simply compassionate human room carefully trying stay one message land rehearsed retort the best example think moderators candidates medicare all merry go round first three talked mean someone starting business point nobody making important aspects debate even though later proposed much less ambitious health care plan appreciated willing stand positive idea even he team player like sen warren else remaining learn 
really think biden best choice president view clearly incredible kind person the tragedies he's endured still happy warrior amazing it's time passed he run sharper 
biden obviously first choice advantage pre existing relationships world leaders might able fix damage trump done stage 
warren supporter do think biden good person it pretty extreme say someone bad wonder reasons position judgment especially lately surrounded yes men people met close genuinely empathetic compassionate believe based record shows lot poor imo intentions 
set much stock ted cruz thinks think sanders narcissist know better running president age 
bernie incredible wonderful person would ted cruz's opinion relevant lol 
imagine basing opinion ted cruz says 
i've known plenty honest assholes 
he horrendous record racial issues says realize black residents south bend suffered police abuse ran president two terms mayor that's either stupid embarrassing lie incredibly truth 
think there's basically two blocks centrists progressives so got biden buttigieg klobuchar sanders warren centrist block solid lead combined support nomination go whoever group right combination momentum ability win suspect it'll though could get maintain probably likely since baggage pete carrying young ish woman appeal lot people might able secure making vp offer get exchange backing signature policy long term legacy she cfpb less politician 
booker genuinely nice guy everything read kind tired people basically decent

oh yea dude totally considered bernie sanders rapist murderer pedophile ted cruz's comments can't wait lord savior win nomination

it simply fact poc still race she win 
such insightful post appreciate warren even 
democrats ya gotta believe elizabeth warren get elected 
electable fear talking there thing stop pundits vote want it matter neighbor thinks 
i'll vote candidate president would excited warren 
im really scared bernie warren splitting progressive vote primaires love hope rally behind whoever takes initial lead fear might end biden 
elizabeth warren plan future believe 
her bernie way better biden 
oh believe warren it american people skeptical defeatist attitude aside candidate excited absolutely win thing 
her plans make sense appear yielding special interests she's intelligent hard working optimistic pragmatic she earned support candidate thus far may force 
please vote honestly believe politician willing fight us fuck donor class fuck joe biden if joe wins nomination guy fucking hate fact came 
american but vote warren based substance well thought policies proposals as many already mentioned electability matter opinion trump course push native issue hope people smart enough let become ancestry also far left many place throughout developed world it time america catch late 
bernie elizabeth rest field imo need blue congress either much 
mean like third choice sure believe just thinks quality vp charisma popularity 
fuck yea aunt liz gonna 
if talked people would said obama electable certainly think donald trump electability fallacy got combat 
not mention one person idea electable may differ greatly someone else 
yep the republicans learned lesson they made mccain nominee romney seen moderate electable then decided nominate right wing lunatic unfortunately 
think elizabeth warren plenty electable anyhow she's intelligent thoughtful good hearted damn fighter when people hear speak see much cares everyday person they'll 
there electable candidate thats one wins trump obama bush clinton carter those folks alive legitimately claim electability 
well knew hillary wasnt electable yet someone got trump also so know talking say everyone i'm funny cute gravitas edit apparently 
she lisa simpson sort person the show predicted trump would president follow so one dozens candidates names think warren win 
got downvoted hell bernie's sub saying name call warren critique policies say awful things they said looked like give worst bj ever something 
if one gets majority together form delegates could still win brokered convention 
how worried something that's already happening progressives war every comment thread liz bernie this surely donor party's plan usher biden trump wax floor happens i'm preparing 
there's point warren major candidate besides maybe buttigieg vp and charisma subjective polls showing popularity growing piling day 
eh the charismatic candidates seem much way policy moderate 
hillary wasn't electable yet million votes remember 
subbed donate suspect lot divisiveness bernie's sub manufactured bad faith actors try let people color view sanders supporters bernie approve name calling warren either 
ugh that's awful we refrain name calling democratic candidates think sub pretty good job sometimes easy get caught frustration anyway thanks rising pettiness 
yeah clearly bogus criticism fan candidates base vote based policy slates legislative history personality club membership appearance things matter problem harsh critique rooted schoolyard taunts trumpy 
fucking christ anyone posting even knows bj feels like 
guess bernie must bj face looking 
the but used republican tired line hear alot 
i'm huge warren supporter completely opposed bernie sanders but much dislike supporters it's insulting popular narrative media monolithic synchronized entity propping knock it possibly climbing polls good candidate 
that's interesting jesus though know deal something like haha will divisive general 
yep if sanders warren well clear collective majority biden wins slim plurality hope delegates would pick progressive preventing weak victor defeating spoiled aligned bloc exactly convention instead casting votes directly 
that's super interesting does anybody know person getting vote primary gains amount delegates people combined and rest split proportionally winner state get extra either way would exciting scenario progressives pooling contested convention winning end 
we're talking getting elected votes completely different things read electoral college 
true bernie stoop low least acknowledges good points like female younger https www newsweek com sanders warren beating polls elect woman tbh supporters irrational make unsupported claims candidates see youtube twitter mostly 
let forget troll farms they convince idiot uncle vote trump also work divide dems take primaries seriously think best dick close ranks 
that's exactly thought if mood argue i'd said bernie appreciate it really disturbed many wanted see blood want debate policies name calling we trump we're better and know supporters like it's warren comes debates wish list voting 
it always makes wonder see sort juvenile insult whether person idiotically emulating maga culture actually simply roleplaying progressive stir shit either way treated one would troll sides whatever division they're attempting create 
like sanders warren legit contender fake 
why insulting if true difference make makes feel also changed warren last several months see changes yet media covers much differently started campaign first kamala beto pete warren's turn get darling's treatment besides can't media propping genuinely getting traction voters 
to add intrigue might bring superdelegates play 
it's extremely complicated i'm definitely expert even winning delegates precisely proportional there kinds state specific rules for instance caucus states might say need least fifteen percent viable awarded some multiple nominating conventions but kind sort proportionally so candidates certain number first round voting national convention superdelegates vote if there's majority someone winner get horse trade can form group agree ticket and make matters pledged however want in general they're likely follow candidate basically 
that million votes statement true primaries well 
bernie class act fan years criticism appears take serious responsibility followers 
worry much they're biased toward running numbers create stronger general election challenger trying throw nomination minority candidate they mostly switched obama soon took delegate lead think they'd act differently presented majority coalition plurality

born raised baby sad voting ny vote count much still got meet liz big speech washington square park 
new plan alert it illegal lie congress court even shareholders also exxon giant corporations federal regulators i've got 
this kind thing i've dubbed past no shit legislation reason already law except massive corporate lobbying 
this i'm team warren policy proposals like so smart thoughtful obviously looking average person status quo can imagine country would years helm 
corporations people running held responsible fuck literally anyone says otherwise 
you would think laws corporate perjury already 
the cynic says corporations find less obvious ways generating junk data pushing studies peer review low tier journals like order skirt not that's reason enact law think it'll hard fully enforce 
as early well public knew dire threat posed climate change exxon scientists proved real that even first time warned fossil fuel companies product warming planet putting lives risk house senior scientist presented https insideclimatenews org news exxons research confirmed fuels role global sobering evidence management showing emissions driving by openly recognized www ciel wp content uploads smoke fumes final pdf scientific consensus would likely cause temperature increase degrees celsius oil began plan related risks assets could shared science but along rest industry chose different path so holy shit lying sounds like year head start addressing nooooo gotta get profits 
can include lying general public well please 
ministry truth sounds kinda scary gonna lie 
this half shining spotlight practice 
the cynic says corporations find less obvious ways generating junk data pushing studies peer review low tier journals like order skirt sure murderers particularly motivated try way get away anyway well that's reason avoid making laws telling cut shit otherwise what's point civilization 
even true would pose barrier makes much harder corporations lie federal agencies which reduce practice stop entirely no criminal law effective stopping target behavior good way look it understanding currently legal mechanism state punish present fake data try influence regulations with exist that win american people also enforcement handled court as notes website bar course high the prove beyond reasonable doubt corporate actors intentionally presented incorrect information hard intent but also important set want discourage legitimate attempts join discussion even worse prosecute someone honest mistake lukewarm warren lately policy huge slam dunk view she back slot primary sure still long wait see race develops 
removed trolling spend time productive endeavors 
warren told family native american ancestors dna test confirmed she never claimed tribal member her hiring nothing ancestry people saw white woman https facts elizabethwarren com 
absolutely i'm anything even slightly move needle toward accountability also highly cynical level power held corporations whether ever get place we're operating playing field speak though panic among billionaires warren's candidacy giving hope front every day 
did stop reading short comment first sentence not that's reason enact law 
even true would pose barrier makes much harder corporations lie federal agencies which reduce practice stop entirely no criminal law effective stopping target behavior good way look totally agreed also said not that's reason enact think brainer important clear eyed talk enacting policies understand always going require us fight tooth nail overcome massive forces distort economy political system lukewarm warren lately might ask want get argument anything i'm primarily surrounded supporters social circle like try voters coming primary 
nope this internet time shit coffee yet sorry my bad 
haha worries apologies shortness tone people make mistakes get coffee good one friend

fake news photoshopped paid actors my inauguration bigger 
this awesome photo but let get ahead we long way lot hard work us nominee chosen alone president afford complacent and forget even warren sails victory still need senate none ambitious plans pass unless democratic control big structural change requires sustained energy top bottom

seriously i've hoping whip smart professor president since forever wished lawrence lessig bigger candidacy ran state office back even obama man greatly respect much theatre america needs drama toned hope warren one we need learn boring politics places like netherlands make policy 
scary think sure private security mean time 
your comment removed spam this way promote candidate if want continue posting please remain substantive respond topic hand 
you made new account say 
it's amazing none still win nomination 
cool obama theatrical his calm demeanor legendary politics never policy narrative important democrats often fail make headway republicans messaging mistake aversion to add warren absolutely sense narrative story needs tell present the whole rally connecting dots women leaders triangle shirtwaist fire labor movement every single stands front giant american flag that's decoration it's subtle still theatre approve btw think theatricality good thing helpful 
this unless exceptional credible death threats by may sen obama approved secret service protection secretary homeland security marking first time history presidential candidate received almost two years prior election https abcnews go com politics secret service factors analysis story id given hated vilified hillary clinton likely would primary already spouse 
dunno remember bernie getting secret service detail never chosen 
he definitely strong position technology feasible it fact could foresee elizabeth adopting piecemeal wholesale similar partnering inslee climate bigger get think many people realize positions sure yang process dropping approach regarding endorsement condition development tech plans direction she pragmatic doubt would open least ideas perhaps even cabinet guessing candidates running anyways beto probably wants hhs hud gabbard state un ambassador likely maybe harris ag booker agriculture marianne williamson head department peace teehee delaney energy etc etc most know never ever president not election warren sanders biden gaffes appears addled numbers start softening soon the dark horse buttigieg simple consistent messaging hurt scandals gotten better improve drop see either candidate however their seem taking hold way that two cents chant going shirt already 
met ewarren years ago she ran past white rabbit costume shouting i'm late for important date it part fundraiser law students could public interest work instead corporate summer that's authentic self 
misread hours ago like warren campaign trail 
love nerdy vibe warren gives i'm ready potus likes wonk problem solve 
the silence aoc kyle kulinski's idiotic tweet quite remarkable she literally sniped dancing someone inside camp another woman candidate goes silent 
this made giggle glee earnest nerd 
heard women politics 'not authentic' something dance authentic if ever stiff reserved unlikable 
absolutely adore personality communication style 
if said hours ago would guessed mushrooms but massive improvement amphetamines current president at least force introspection thinking consequences 
i'm big ol fan aoc stunned stand warren disappointed left willing ignore defend sexism guy 
edit missed justice democrats association still kinda skeptical needs answer is sort aoc kulinski i'm aware because really think aoc's responsibility denounce expecting fratty white collar douche seems kind problematic it would nice obviously expecting position every shit take leftist another example twitter's utter toxicity 
ootl believe aoc obligated comment kyle kulinski 
one favorites genre white guy twitter calling kamala harris putting hot sauce greens he claimed pandering black people even level yuck 
prefer call 'technocrats' and yes need 
aoc thin ice brocialists warren months ago ready drop endorsing bernie fast enough women candidates never left matter 
know truly believe call someone problematic behavior still agreeing things it shows integrity certain matters disappointing chose go silent 
if shocked left often deeply sexist racist rock hiding don want break rule long history sort behavior entire party 
say obligated given history hard time also dancing certainly could've stood liz 
it aoc always quick respond things her silence something like place given history clap backs 
maybe pandering indian people yeah hillary got shit saying carried hot sauce like think tank would dream something 
put hot sauce eventually maybe burn yuck bleh hot greens pandering tastebuds 
it's entrenched society hard call people respect shit others 
deeply sexist it saddening see two candidates apologize seeming angry speech women no one took issue joe biden yelling like forgot hearing aid debates i've turn volume times spoke 
accusing women inauthentic pervasive can't trust stereotype find comment atm yesterday someone listed ways presents today golddiggers lying rape pretending hold views get ahead 
also kulinski founding member organization aoc part 
think much better term 'bernie bro' imo critical towards specific type leftist bernie bro often used make look like support base young white dudes something true less ameri centric countries brocialists 
it's hard necessary we can't turn hypocrites 
absolutely mean imply exclusive democrats yet many think sexism racism purview republicans alone 
it's hard necessary we can't turn hypocrites you try comment removed violating rule lol 
agree saw heavily bernie supporters pro women movement sparked lot sexism warren clean either want call it never addressed big concern needed 
build evidence provide rational way pretty much opposite screeching dancing twitter something happened aoc warren 
sourced substantive critiques democrats violate rule 
literal decades extreme sexism racism within democratic party decide divisive current candidate running nomination cool 
okay disagree tactic would say sexist booker's dad jokes biden's senior moments 
shit making reference seething hypocrisy comes dems racist sexist 
oh i'm sorry realize call bernie my bad guess cool way literally exactly complaining 
what fuck i'm going argue random garbage someone thinks women dance horror inauthentic incapable that's conversation whatever new goalpost plan drag closet 
the issue women dancing people fucking dance want trying pass scripted humor spontaneity organic 
cool story mean fact apologize women campaign says something he aware sexism attracts yet never addresses glad see bad faith argument really highlighted though 
uh huh the kind person would dress white rabbit goofy college thing grandma dance like big whoop 
reminder warren wants full single payer full year bernie stopgaps along way needy if believe makes claims everything maybe examine factors could lead disbelieve 
if passionate giving single payer healthcare fighting chance country elizabeth warren candidate 
believe we've seen power access medicare aca the got ones attest viability this agree people blame obama settling bad law he choice it either something nothing gave reason dream bigger demand 
single payer makes sense important issue democracy support warren energy commitment regulating free market greatest threat country stands https www vox com policy politics elizabeth warren democratic primary 
it drives crazy people claim walked back promise medicare bc anything plan likely actually get implemented 
cannot upvote strongly enough love love plan 
it annoys end willfully stupid people warren anyone says backtracked immediately invalidates opinion stance imo if bothered least skim bolded text one flagship proposals know shit care say 
feel like bernie supporters oblivious promising plan enact anything warren proven experience making deals work so frustrating better she even debater vote nominee worried ability close deal beat trump 
she needs attack bernie left warren one leave mark debate attacking right like everybody else stage hit answers pay implement for constantly scoffing scolding anyone tries challenge issue make case candidate trust getting passed ask commit ending filibuster 
and said first day office 
i'm idea guy let women unpopular hard work figuring revolutionize healthcare first deal backlash alone numbers tank swoop take credit supporters 
the issue version health care robust enough screenshot she wants third year in politics limited amount political capital something third year like think back obama's republicans came office could never accomplish anything congress support warren i'm voting confidence work congressional democrats pass agenda bernie handle majority actions executive order we've seen trump upend orders eos good younger one term little faith two think theory right corruption needs handled else real progressive change possible but position healthcare makes waiver because reality probably happen it's legitimate concern washington presidents get time maybe pattern bad bet 
for fun throwback here's one guy might heard skinny kid funny name proponent single payer health care https www youtube com watch fpayan fxce 
sanders supporter warren close second think that's pretty good plan it would prove works without go full first edit lot easier get expand aca people work 
what say girl uses talent offensive worse wants credit much crazy tolerated ask god evolution sometimes wonder feels like smart female ape females human 
talk people like think comes preachy instead fiery many debate performances fiery warren that liked first appeared daily show moons ago lack knowing audience costing polls agree policies sanders got passion gravitating toward 
know promise definitely sanders the problem getting aggressiveness plan support push 
why want fight twice that doubles chances failing 
second got least amount heat backtracked claimed framework 
she getting rid private healthcare though right that big thing differentiates plans dealt insurance evil 
this one many reasons warren even declared like bernie overall message big ideas skeptical much would get done her plans pretty similar seems pragmatic maybe sanders well elected faith things another example really important student debt relief both candidates version plan eliminates almost point remember exact numbers know amount starts fade household income reaches cancel the latter benefit wife combine make erased entirely proposal far likely passed 
wish try first years history shows presidents typically lose congress midterms republicans control either chamber point get passed 
obama years dem controlled house senate he could passed single payer bill but wanted bipartisan support never got anything though lack trying part and democrats place it want fully capable looking every modernized nation world identifying solution like everyone else nice play kumbya republicans that things love warren she wants fix problems understands fight 
people demanding bernie's also liz's movement obama nothing 
she walk back clarified think people looking excuses attack point 
spoke someone weekend said bernie supporter believed elizabeth's plan put people medicare right away would bankrupt system needed add everyone get younger cover older people's costs like realize able pass he's planning phase year olds first second third warren's actually gets covered earlier got radio silence 
what really makes wonder bernie supporters think actually applied not end if pass eo day one happen hospitals gonna like oh bill government easy piecey in situation see hospitals massively shutting matter months worst case likely go path trump immigration ban getting boggled court battles states like honestly spectrum possibility know and people nah worry campaigning even worse progressives obama got elected achieved promised instead realizing get time fulfill promises made entirely issue went well trickster meanwhile saying fine campaign promise doesn make sense edit fixed typo 
waffled used bernie never taking second step turning idea reality confuse waffling lol 
think important point continued refine plan strategy gone along she added lot detail since came candidate read info within first week time website essentially included hyperlinks letters academics cost structure these way seem removed digress among surprised shifted timeline thought concession personally recently revisited site see new stuff the lesson everyone willfully stupid it really possible people trying stay informed perhaps would advisable remind check changes warren constantly making improvements 
oblivious word bernie's promising liz knows what's going she gave warning stop lying nevada debate read lines his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone asks question tries fill details actually make work warren said sanders and advisers say probably happen anyway https www washingtonpost com politics candidate fights nevada 
bernie plan though he's going add dental vision healthcare medicare drop age first year office lower subsequent years we're covered i'm saying bernie's fleshed elizabeth warren's definitely why continue peddle lie when gets nom hurt us much anti instead pro warren even believe better 
they oblivious intentionally peddling misinformation counting ignorance prevail 
this really best argument proved real vote getter bernie warren never pushed back idea abandoned probably people like harry reid ear telling pragmatic plus going filibuster casts doubt whether get domestic agenda 
bernie camp warren announced left reason supporters kind coalition honored proud part embarrassed honestly call bro point exhausted constantly calling lies even blatant sexism homophobia racism there subset resort tactics win deal shit like ideology lot we pretty closely aligned but approach tone matters ps far likely polling nd surging right super tuesday vote that primaries she could still pull done see bill clinton 
removed rule yes hiding rule behind sentences light support warren going list another candidates talking points still counts 
it fdr strategy roll transition create public demand ease fears win midterms back popularity policy pass admittedly lot could go wrong admission never try bernie bill fails gate nuke filibuster 
she explicitly states later third year reads wants completed finalized started 
think actually advantage going move onto third year that gives chance people whatever republicans throw like death panels crap last time giving realize health care feasible good thing important remember mike lee caught saying we need repeal obamacare warren wants let get something see first 
think back obama's third year to fair lost house point years later senate one thing gop good obstructing govt functioning the map better democrats rd lot republicans reelection majority larger likely post election also given younger progressive people active politics ever pt increase https www census gov library stories behind united states midterm turnout html compared bodes well increasing members she much chance passing legislation 
should point republican potus voted ford registered gop wanted vote closed primary specter changed went first time fight bankruptcy bill she reaganite aids crisis nonsense attack see lot 
years progress we're trying chapo anybody but plans get nickel dime time 
it attempt progressive anyone standards warren they different ways outside economics bernie fp social issues this countering blatant misinformation want full fast saying stuff years accomplished much to weakness typical politician knows say brand never gets done 
we voting someone position today 
think trying progressive anybody better chance delivering results right being something longest period time measure success 
got fiery passion does to seems like grouchy yelling vote sanders wins primary lately becoming distant second choice instead close one 
sanders winning branding frustrating she got way substance capacity enact plans 
are stir things supporting warren another reason genuinely asking post history suspicious 
getting public option acting transition plan something significantly popular across board right every dem likely even republicans senate would willing back get passed you around half republican voters older crowd votes ones benefiting heavily public the younger lost auto coverage turn audience clamoring pivotal making gains need pass 
the theory first days signs eo needy then anti corruption laws abolished filibuster right midterms blue wave support public option law everyone covered however people paying extra private coverage include benefits so slowly move even politically makes financial sense this transition make get opinion turn much favorable towards bernie plan force congress compromise anticorruption changes pray works 
it this chapo talking point 
because knows full pass current system so wants fight public option first immediately help people get favorable senate done 
yeah talking clearly hurt polls bad campaign strategy talk she going peel supporters bernie hurting moderates 
better aoc completely capitulated https www axios com aoc medicare public option bernie sanders fc html and disbelieve i'm sure day ask st bernard much plan cost not even couple weeks ago markets businessinsider news stocks slammed finance pay healthcare could bernie answer donnell you know costs sanders nobody knows this impossible predict lol she actually multi stage get nothing rally kentucky wake fever dream 
bernie protest bill absolutely framework 
hope sanders supporters understand many people like start figuring better ways build coalition 
at year yes that full means single payer bill supported bernie proposed protest admittedly rather serious proposal 
removed rule spread false misleading information warren's plan website introduces full legislation year three earlier would implemented bernie unrealistically optimistic case gets passed immediately don't come sub lie candidate 
also warren's plan student loans largely day executive powers iirc 
household income really much still incredibly unfair messed education system shamefull western world 
she votes abolish filibuster next congress she'll fight get elected midterm think anyone who's running accomplish warren 
i'd argue approach makes sense context first priorities corruption election reform congressional majority one willing pass progressive policy coming midterms much likely scenario get rid voter suppression tactics republicans using if want sustainable majorities win big fight per presidency need lay groundwork warren understands candidate engage reality 
this makes assumption democratic control automatically get want unfortunately true plenty dems would go far edit silly auto correct word 
obama years dem controlled house senate try four months the truth democrats total control house representatives full therefore senate september february grand https www beaconjournal com akron pages obama congress 
your take aca completely revisionist he never gop support ever passage seriously pursue the house passed single payer reason dropped could get enough democrats board pass still attached too many conservative blue dog dems lieberman ind nelson ne example would rather tanked entirely public option included it anything republicans 
you also need understand huge difference today back expected something big got bipartisan support it pre tea party isolationist politics blame obama wanting moment right thing 
obama years dem controlled house senate he really 
this completely untrue he tried get support single payer first realized votes senate 
obama filibuster proof majority senate four months https www beaconjournal com article news the passed aca wire last days democrats control 
obama never really filibuster proof majority could passed single payer bill without republican support https huffpost com us entry guccounter 
bernie able run enough people experienced liked medicare many burned greedy insurance companies but agree one made focal point election 
oh think also people actually wanna hear nuance policy discussions want sausage 
not end if think pass eo day one happen look part protesting front mitch mcconell's house confusing it's way everything get done mitch'll compromise but seriously supporters said protests ky would force mcconnell senators work sanders worried safety gated communities otherwise joke they downton abbey shit 
i've asking bernie supporters they're looking candidate significant number respond simply revolution they favorite policy proposals want discuss tear things 
oh know bernie movement obviously getting passed how he got the uh yeah guess no questions please 
not end it goes public option transition built bill the simplified difference warren plan sanders wants take one fell swoop fight two different fights 
medicare currently largest insurance provider country every one age enrolled uses every day you imagine simply allowed people enroll much would change now let everybody medicare wouldn't using thing happens grandmother 
spoke someone week said like warren many ideas pie sky pick things wanted get done stick 
it'll hilarious wins present realistic plan pass fans see waffling realistically sad nothing gets done refuses anything resembling compromise 
agree completely think time stop saying read lines say bluntly late 
they said plan enact he funding getting bill passed the actual bare bones well would need greatly expounded upon like factor least specifics warren got trouble bernie crowd rightly calling framework it pages compare real healthcare ppaca far less comprehensive reform 
agree saying rule policy consider nicknames given candidates violation if edit i'll approve comment delete mine 
this rich come progressive she the senator fight banks wall street elite they getting appointed obama admin bernie where cfpb needed nomination blocked firebrand whole time permission if much president 
warren first presidential candidate sign pledge stop keystonexl pipeline restore climate test energy projects

this show people say support warren woman no actually plan gets shit done think she'd better candidates running though respect democrat well recognize alot good ideas 
because russia country devastating kompromat trump

high hopes nevada caucuses measure voter enthusiasm larger extent primaries with sanders supporters fiasco going union leaders demonstrating polarizing already weary democratic base buttigieg klobuchar polling badly poc biden lacking real chance warren shine think results bit like iowa minus overwhelming white vote messed tallying thus pushing this means might st nd could even conceivably pass consensus candidate others viable if happens media longer ignore start talking alternative lot voters progressive ideas find bridge far home note accounted bloomberg buying way hope end factor and refuse get bickering match myriad issue respond kind comment i'm mood lurkers

this seems like right place talk talking twitter get doxxed 
as bernie supporter agree coverage unfair warren there inherent bias media toward progressivism she's absolutely nd pick would thrilled vote general cant really say candidates right 
that's i'm hoping caucuses measure voter enthusiasm biden nevada white enough bring klobuchar buttigieg levels got iowa new hampshire that leaves sanders warren hopefully bloomberg of two hope supporters nonviable candidates see viable alternative could even propel past but gets second place change media narrative get voters start looking unity candidate 
bernie supporter love warren i'd vote knelt alter promised weak ass vp bros idea woke the impersonation uncanny 
i'm largely pretty amused see narrative forming around bernie treated like frontrunner media it got big even corporate elite longer deny coverage can't possibly synchronized cabal treat point never and jobs acting accordingly saying mainstream perfect far but i'd argue commensurate status race in long shot beaten landslide he possible favorite today reflects instead there's always conspiracy theory reminds all powerful deep state conspiracies the hates trump stop election media nonetheless still covers 
what bothers bernie supporters whose sole purpose coming warren sub shill confront claim right suck oxygen room engage second choice so that's hate candidates slightly less that justify brigading they see acting entitled brigade subs say us contrast yes yes know all

seems like living two different worlds sure seen warren campaign supporters antagonistic 
i've seen bernie supporters know slander warren's reputation good name basically try paint corporate centrist establishment shill months resent lot one admitted motivation help thought disparaging warren it's scorched earth tactics object not voters prefer 
same if sanders i'd backing warren there's option beyond two unfortuantely latter see path nomination point in end think run centrist capitalized biden's collapse anything that's amy still surging she bided time waited biden fail without buttigieg race klobuchar would frontrunner at compromise vp nominee as much prefer want lose seat senate 
it klobuchar raised million since nh debate reference ever single quarter big money donors hunting alternative biden now amy pete add bernie surge fundraising well relative performance fantastic candidate unfairly counted simply good enough media cover fairly 
she cash needs drop annoying frequent line attack 
bernie actually best women color worst white males quit sexist smears please 
mean know think bernie ignored long time media there definitely level unfairness certainly deserve succeeding much that said btw i'm warren supporter benefit let's real clinton treated guy way gingerly candidates except maybe pete even that's stretch they're terrified voters come around vote general election baggage literally never ever aired really took seriously even he's leading still sensationalizing rivals rather giving glowy underdog frontrunner treatment gave august october blackout lmao helps something hate least vetted contenders people socialist label enough bother it'd mistake let continue 
ikr it disturbs willing left trade crackpot conspiracy theories we supposed better 
in long shot got beaten landslide he treated know said done but even campaign lack coverage like candidates warren today 
also took look warren post anywhere near many comments like controversial if anything downvoted people criticizing 
based headline frankly recent example comes there's plenty 
think sanders supporters see better record political instincts they there's evidence he's years congress get things done instead barely build coalition meanwhile warren came help address financial crisis developed oversaw creation entirely new agency without even elected yet whose actually brought change fruition it nothing bizarre characterization misogynists why because understand how tell us we're seeing true bc make sense ask woman man express conflicting view situation pays reputation gets dragged mud liar epithet sounds familiar 
and i'm sick bullshit response there plenty civil bernie supporters outright lying deny legion bad actor cult like bros using maga tactics quash discussion consideration candidates aggression harassment intimidation brigading when finally called campaign talked sides mouth candidate giving token sending surrogates marching orders continue tired demanded sub bow swear fealty less country voted ahead warren getting pms saying things support hate women people color incredibly coming bro try gaslight existence 
you realize toxic posts democrats cth public no one buys unity charade 
think anyone denies bernie women poc supporting pretending vocal contingent harass people twitter pure gas lighting call whatever want exist fact lean behavior helpful 
think every supporter bernie bro tm if trying say one bernie's supporters internet troll harassing us better part year whole lot movement many clear headed respectful kind he also contingent people harassed others long time would personally use different word describe two groups understand want lump together 
you scroll bottom candidate's posts bernio bro gets defensive one true berners knock shit rest us take umbrage emotional intellectual maturity understand common enemy progressive movement too bad there's shortage lately 
that's switched bernie brigade firmly believe women capable horrible trolls men 
yep watching whole thing unfold infuriating depressingly familiar repeatedly amazed way people treat warren she best choice race arguably one choices period but like smart principled senator clear track record cleaning corruption even clearer plan future juggle then maybe vote 
have seen posts catch kill tactics use articles stuff absolutely wild come good vibes inspiration volunteer sanity checks catharsis lol sometimes definitely feel like rest reddit lost mind 
what's sub it appears parent comment removed moderator see full name stumbled upon 
honestly account alt use want deal getting harassed main it's ridiculous point nice blow steam 
keep sanity even subreddit candidate keeps encroached upon people wanting aggressively defend promote across whole reddit universe like subreddits if think going convert voters sure working 
straight main account posts time bit much identifying info that's split lol 
didn't advocate another specific candidate just bit friendly advice progressive who's community's shoes good luck team warren 
there something nate silver posted problem right nh bunch news networks basically narrative headline new amy surges rd second biggest pete third sanders wins the media care candidate good solid place anything horseraces exciting things similar kept showing trump stuff sad thing us coverage even biased seen recently 
just reading words needs drop almost made reflexively downvote comment there many bad faith actors spamming across social media infuriating 
think every supporter bernie bro tm many clear headed respectful kind supporters he also contingent people harassed others long time would personally use different word describe two groups understand want lump together 
you're displaying exactly blindness everyone else thread talking congrats farce 
to honest i'm kind terrified material right wing use obviously unfairly sanders work get years trump for reason want candidates media properly vet we need find ability withstand harsh vetting late nominee taken surprise things like spent youth living kibbutz swore allegiance joseph stalin even swung flag half mast died or honeymoon soviet union you might roll eyes accept unfair average less informed voter are going wonder communist sheep's clothing particularly often shouts revolution worried much baggage dragged one talking see fight back come ahead whether equipped withstanding criticism 
one thing need put perspective bernie well caucuses because inherently undemocratic typically vote might get primary so measures voter enthusiasm measure support general had many states running gotten delegates instead quite possible hillary clinton would for example north dakota caucus crushed even close south narrowly same demographic different ways voting fortunately time around dnc reduced including territories iowa nevada wyoming low delegate want guess supporters saying that conspiracy sanders instead actually fairer process increases participation every supporter brings suppression democratic nomination closed primaries vs open registration deadlines always bring system inexplicable reason usually respond back 
https www cpr org bernie sanders draws denver rally they

removed no actual sources utilized call people research you provide reasons voting warren elsewhere it sub's responsibility prove wrong 
they candidates wouldn't surprised one trump 
because know years sanders done little but liz she one went banks it disgusting gained liz resume apparently takes yell finger wag 
most american thinking sensibly that becomes painfully obvious many people's second choice candidate seems one that's different first 
my support sanders warren seen insane inane reasons one loved hated often contradictory 
it's amazing set aside policy stuff sanders obviously different approaches check lot boxes base supporters warren much warmer funnier charming hard understand relatable i've met bernie get wrong support gruff seems annoyed want meet spend time people on hand personable wants hear peoples' stories takes know like that's important part times years may recognize face name anything but event helping take pictures rope line end everyone else got picture looked said what oh worry gotten plenty busy go next and nonsense this good encouraged come pic it moment could easily okay moved warmth natural instinctive 
genuine question how much think woman can't help feel male spoke way would seen well spoken great plan country whereas labelled condescending without hearing actual merit behind saying 
i've also thinking afraid sounding snobby think warren may appeal college educated people pragmatic knows politics works she policies rigid drastic usually gets nothing done people's emotions reason her slogan big structural change guess average american far seeing wants things either go back normal everything completely the problem trump symptom historically revolutions fail miserably succeed high price hope sound elitist wanted add 
think comes condescending gather public told elitist republicans certain someone's campaign followers ever listened bought refuse accept anyone actually speak hold people accountable congress thinks things jon stewart said much first interview financial crisis made plain clear problem feel manageable anyone listens would sort comfort feeling like here's leader knows wtf going fix pr team needs put moments talking get message across 
she's intelligent well spoken worst woman sadly negatives much american electorate 
my dad loyal democrat comes family democrats told nevada debate thought shrill cringed read he college educated midwestern older blind spots good man supports huge portion platform she somehow rubs wrong way doubt part generation raised view women that said top candidate start harris likes klobuchar definitely opposed generally something challenge warren sadly faces factors matter often 
probably condescending plus woman want make gender questions electability last fall dog whistles friends 
think people ever heard hear speak second sound bites that's disconnect making snap judgement lecturing elite woman without hearing saying 
think relatable problem campaign thing bernie opportunity learn hillary clinton he needed groundswell beginning foment momentum forward early primary all due respect liz behind count running president since started discount anything run devised policy plans otherwise except failing make strategy change already made 
the political media lot answer 
two problems see they need cull debate stage get serious bloomberg disqualified hes late game can't step th disrespectful process anyone cut instantly that alone would brought manageable number months earlier these debates nobody time make argument counterargument game shows contestants blurt answers moderators think funny opinions matter hosts go watch something like intelligence squared youtube that's run pick topic medicare sit bernie liz team moderates another have third someone articulate good position job explain structure allotted 
think that's what's missing warren's messaging actually like idea president leading push state reform the reforms stick need happen federal level if vote's clean government mandates quality life states want highly regulated role party moving back left belongs ones rocking 
warren huge grassroots coalition offices every state territory much better sanders recognizing midterms local elections going matter ton actually getting policy implemented 
tire seeing sanders supporters parking sub like 
only one constituency stays home submits protest votes candidate nominee nonwhite americans 
firefox containers work pretty well lately i've using auto reader mode https addons mozilla org en us firefox addon auto reader view extension bypass paywalls it switches mode paywall gets chance load 
literally cited sources youtube clips warren speaking and others using youtube make bernie look bad must count right 
but share one important quality almighty penis 
mean they're thinking sensibly means probably paying attention 
which cracks dark depressing way 
well people vote sorts different reasons not voters based policy personally 
it help sanders base odd cult like persona i've seen people know seem matter talking warren comparable attack anyone bernie 
agreed saw someone politics say low emotional intelligence like talking elizabeth warren 
best every way really amazing 
saying male women put lose situation come feminine polite they're weak emotional if stern masculine gross different way warren balanced two best one possibly simply yet enough people mean look amy klobuchar's grating arrogance see though but seriously wonder electorate confusing stage 
two cats work nonprofit biden seems like would listen talk job sanders blow care warren actually remember names it based vibe always interested personally voter someone 
hard understand relatable no penis and unfortunately lot americans that's required feature presidency 
in way shrill angry coded words hide sexism behind description woman used directly warren hillary past want point jewish people often labelled terms neurotic cold humorless impersonal list four i've seen 
if elizabeth warren chromosome she'd points 
keep hearing pete sounds presidential couldn't male white educated 
oh sure she's hamstrung idea women speak bold forceful manner perceived shrill hysterical https qz com year tried reclaim anger failed lines spoken man interpreted inspirational passionate the righteous slighted white www wsj articles brett kavanaughs good use case and here's key progressives angry state country government rightfully so we're seeking conduit frustration someone give voice but since publicly allowed way men leaves disadvantage despite history service organizational acumen still support feel important call one things find conservatives often little problem called sexist whatever dare even hint progressive's actions may influenced unconscious bias take harshly partially build identities around certified wokescore 
if man she'd the man 
it's sad preface educated intelligent discussion elitism offend people fragile egos insecurity issues think message close still quite resonant hoping admittedly sanders bit better messaging others pointed he's gone game already for example slogan mentioned may fix system something people hear broken daily helps appeal big structural change verbose average jane joe personally needed find way stand huddling medicare all using cents tax thing resonates well in view come swinging campaign finance election reform root every issue tie back problem go step everyone else calling publicly funded elections revoking fptp use ads educate means source single washington saying corruption often nice vague say past tense going hard course eve super tuesday less hopefully pull 
it's really emotions appeal contest the past several candidates change better worse obama trump maybe bernie think american thing human people quickly become dissatisfied what's happening around fast enough go different extreme candidate next time 
my thoughts propaganda mechanisms well understood probably anyone academicians intelligent people lived authoritarian regimes able recognize analyze think one propaganda's first precepts majority thing heard sticks longest so even hears words elizabeth warren elitist condescending know that's emotional impression gets formed and trump era emotions often override logical rational thinking 
amy klobuchar shrill but possibly describe warren i'd tempted ask he's confusing two 
this accusation often lobbed warren think tells full story she favorability numbers latinx black voters comparable sanders first time candidate they breaking way vote fact bernie year head start outreach would explain lot if look nevada results people say got total but break demographics share number much higher proportion terrible though basically consolidated cross demo support also considering race competing popular former vp different win unless dislodge unlike pete amy lack trying 
mike brzezinski said misogynist stuff ever heard lately due well elizabeth done recent debates the one really upset questioning whether bloomberg kill male third party witness says remembers bad this woman believe women cool two years ago they played montage episodes morning joe they've treated warren least half clips belittling success ahead think need quit watching msnbc better cnn point worse ways 
go watch something like intelligence squared youtube that's debate run pick topic medicare sit bernie liz team moderates another have third someone articulate good position moderators job explain structure allotted time think would love format 
agreed debates joke they want actually get candidates's positions public sell ads grab headline sound clips drive views clicks and please rid audiences why cheering booing like wwe match it's stupid 
like either uniformity laws patchwork but something general population believes corner unique needs special treatment work real estate everyone thinks need traffic study number parking spaces new building despite many already existing city county state establishing similar trends that carries enacting people want feel personalized stake we're federal system think that's perception difference enough create level differences heck even enact different policies just one win small victories establish foundation support national the gop trying succeeding agenda alec let's beat game my ultimate point though people make stuff happen if limited get much engagement also local firing 
ok seeing level support think media spoil fight gives unfair equality well designed plans ones missing substance sexism also play but that's whole is emphasizing winning local campaigns enough because message breaking 
support warren voting phonebanked going super tuesday group watch party my family uses budget plan developed daughter her plans awesome i'm board supported sanders running clinton general this something feel different type messaging campaigns think bad thing raise observations 
it today showing yesterday evening weird thanks 
you seem interested telling people vote warren rather bernie genuine question is good approach mind do believe effective way persuade voters through anger instead inspiration 
klobuchar voters overwhelming select warren second choice 
yeah totally right cult personality behind bernie when warren announced campaign almost everyone knew die hard excited then soon waited made one misstep took carte blanche start shouting everywhere much freaking hated it's crazy been known someone used terms senate get bunch shit done felt like way people damn outspoken effed banks but talk worked pass legislation understand wtf happened 
i've encountered wild it's definitely weird something share sanders warren decent politicians far i'm able determine without getting know decade human beings either one would make excellent president 
definitely seen then i've people publicly hate intent humiliate make even worse the whole dynamic us vs sides puts debating topic 
here answer question hands the reason people support sanders specifically versus candidate policies perceive bernie genuine identical accepted substitute lack literal decades worth receipts fighting causes even back political suicide whatever positives candidates bring table confidence continue fight exactly things says if that's dimension using evaluate difficult anyone else win frankly liz make happen angle far strongest case relative may little late point it really could landed several months ago edit downvote ignore facts want behind like consider cult personality fail understand source candidates' appeal peril 
she either shrill angry sounds like cry low emotional intelligence there winning types 
but seriously wonder electorate confusing two stage for sure we need recognize make real change happen 
legitimate concern but times i've private events he's unwilling take time talk anyone head moving mentality came quite cold seen hug voters clearly part charm gruff grandpa know exists somewhere come either met 
agree off topic believe pete also would higher gay sexism homophobia still rampant even racism imo 
i'm sure much would change dynamics race who less factor votes come that clearly liz targeting can't tell voters get 
pete bill clinton impersonator without sex appeal charm he sounds presidential hes copying bills mannerisms 
he sounds like doesnt anything bring table his sales pitch every debate please vote reason behind 
trump many supporters united running blatant identity politics based fear self righteousness they rally around majority identities mainly white christian vilify disadvantaged muslim mexican black women etc this brand epitomized quote he hurting people needs https www vox com policy trump shutdown voter florida punishes states voted favors supported political many left want help various groups compassion the policies criticized benefit everyone ubi middle classes medicare all broadband for immigrants color lgbt disabilities right criticize divisive pandering claim extra unfair punishment others promoting equal outcomes vs opportunities some argued criticism liberal example also said canceling student loans fundamental attack systematic discrimination economic inequality emotion behind prejudice disbelief dismissive cancelling loan suffer irresponsible smart comparing qualify to provide analogy when person pain go doctor says head managed deal without medication able well sum let frame helping diverse negative if means using term use helping great key beat essentially disarming we fall trap goes mexicans need fight otherwise one day us alone identity liberalism it saving defense 
reminder elizabeth warren first candidate support impeachment 
that's nothing warren advocated financial product safety commission year financial collapse she among three people claim seen coming found evidence while i'm fence clear front runner emerges single fact alone leaning towards 
from twitter feed the mueller report lays facts showing hostile foreign government attacked election help donald trump welcomed once elected obstructed investigation attack put next step hands congress authority prohibit president corrupt use order protect integrity administration justice correct process exercising impeachment to ignore repeated efforts obstruct disloyal behavior would inflict great lasting damage country suggest current future presidents free abuse power similar ways severity misconduct demands officials parties set aside political considerations constitutional duty that means house initiate proceedings united states thank senator it seems courage one's time low never backing hard fight putting first 
yet another reason warren anti corruption candidate 
i've thought several times today and reminded mother 
this true leadership looks like warren 
i'm glad congress finally starting something now would use contempt powers witness refuses answer questions have capitol police arrest 
fwiw candidates supported impeachment way late 
born day year merrill streep 
and yet unable see capitalism problem the whole system comes crashing every ten years if roommate would moved long time ago 
but case warren wrong it soon pelosi everything right 
i'm much downfall capitalism next comrade happen increments warren giant step right direction 
can explain pelosi everything right i'm seeing people making argument 
pelosi pretty much impeached tons pressure if trump essentially admit treason live tv probably impeaching not sure people think playing chess 
the president personally committed crime attempts tie appropriated ukraine aid sort probe hunter biden fact would benefit adding congressional appropriations subject presidential whims 
the mueller report dud all republicans hoping we'd try impeach would backfire obstructing investigation valid charge people feels like circular logic pelosi running politics warren called impeachment earlier knew going happen 
pelosi reaping record breaking political donations country suffering trump's hands she blocking impeachment personal power warren's greatest strength aligning party leadership they're right defying heads asses 
there already enough impeach obstruction justice campaign finance violations emolument clause 
or mueller report described impeachable behavior 
new poll finds elizabeth warren statistical tie biden first place nationally percent 
if wins iowa think gonna walk away thing 
and looking bad establishment since candidate already losing momentum 
biden provides inspiration i'll vote warren hand seems willing shoot moon she inspire folks get involved that way we're gonna stuff together trump leaves office 
love warren overall point article joe statistical tie polls extremely volatile right effectively none trusted one poll might biden nearly tied yougov another respectively the hill massive divide additionally consistently pollster low twenties following group people meaning may statistically applicable larger electorate overall kind political climate stakes high democrats terrified nominating wrong candidate level randomness renders polling stage largely unreliable 
although onoy one poll change research got iowa i'm hoping best 
statistical tie meaningless phrase despite warren within margin error mean numbers poll statistically indistinguishable biden definitely still behind especially compare others still great upward momentum let try avoid setting unrealistic expectations 
as georgian stand cheating shitstain sitting governor office nothing would make happier voting warren abrams ticket next year 
well that's weird maybe voters actually want middle road bullshit told 
the term statistical tie pointless misleading being within margin error tells sample size closeness race margins confidence interval normal curve look statistics curves info 
yang soon overtake the day come we americans get freedom dividend we'll work economy measured new metrics incentivize human centered capitalism medicare enviromentally friendly modern infrastructure trickle upon us https www yang com 
are still superdelegates they override popular 
winning iowa nevada well outperforming expectations south carolina would set nicely weather whatever super tuesday brings success new hampshire expected turn heads write headlines 
feel pretty confident iowa since warren many concrete policies going really easy supporters advocate positions people lot enthusiastic supporting support biden 
if wins iowa biden's campaign implodes 
she right attitude win iowa sure 
really like disagree the race favor far most black voters south gravitate biden mostly bc dont know candidates associate obama she going make meaningful impression southern states else see similar outcome bernie close northern compete well it might lead convention wins iowa bag 
would excited walk voting booth and thought never happy vote someone lifetime 
except volatile biden consistently rest since announced campaign sanders warren trailing behind this first time seen move past big deal 
that mean margin error bigger still good track weighted average time support ok excited realistic nomination comes around continue supporting republican candidate 
you compare previous polls pollster for example the economist poll elizabeth warren behind biden points previously 
warren o'rourke dream ticket talk fire fury 
yougov also online poll use cellular phones i'd wait one rated polls margin error https projects fivethirtyeight com pollster ratings regardless good news we're going work harder get nomination 
there vote first convention ballot 
no pretty sure dnc gave boot 
think much like obama sc winning iowa probe electable killing silly narrative black people know point women especially speaking anecdotally family friends who paying attention warren peaking lot interest talking issues long ignored including bernie 
think like as white woman desperate beat trump whole life liberty changed much administration want office reasons recognize affected presidency way poc so think see lot black people support biden narrative easily 
if find aggregate polling data margin error around valuable i'm afraid missing larger point but agree okay excited 
completely agree love o'rourke yet expirience president opinion he'd amazing vp know could wipe floor pence 
rourke top choice veep could bring home texas gop fucked also immediately switch angles getting rid ec want 
there still superdelegates less that said worried overriding people they 
saying nh matter it absolutely ideally would win three that said sends less message let observe possible scenarios takes st two states nd one place ia nv if pick scenario probably best momentum going forward 
https twitter com sahilkapur status polls suggest well known among blacks nearly really keep election rn aware like biden this might spent lot time weighing options already know obama different case his issue opposite black pretty easily get vote whites iowa represents receptive that good indicator ew exact also consistently polling mid stage the candidate anecdotal evidence nice polls speak louder needs hitting asap think ppl keeping six months away but things moving make sure position dems room relax trump beaten 
that literally if loses another dem early people see weaker thought 
also vast majority voters obsessed politics us subscribed elizabeth warren subreddit they living lives maybe reading headlines watching evening news know joe biden think nice guy would lot stable trump extent 
even larger margin error aggregate several polls narrow it statistically useless recording dice roll actual polling data valuable sense place bets but combined put context tracked and see wrong getting supporters excited long remember realistic come nomination also definitely lol margin guess calculated expected distribution sample size 
the way superdelogates make difference election candidates pretty much tie which unfortunate given article thread 
just side note stop calling black people blacks it comes condescending tone saying trying far better turn phrase sound like group humanity kind referring women females conversation 
think anyone relaxing btw time matter candidate warren polling solidly nd place many races far winning iowa seem crazy also black women much core party point shifting biden support folks mostly based imo veep obama as times goes continues slipping everyone sees big mess 
and that's fair even though want warren president joe biden got nomination would donate support way better alternative 
see ew really overtaking biden race actually begins bc probably say stupid shit warren keep but likely possibility north south another story flexible team communicate well demos great 
me every single night since set monthly donations 
apparently leaves voice mail telling missed call imo much worse 
missed call washington dc weeks ago think sometimes would post see anyone knew want accidentally doxx 
time scammer saying social security number cancelled 
relevant article https reductress com post new phone app screens calls arent elizabeth warren reductress today 
holy crap lol get lot calls scammers sometimes day never answer unknown numbers rely leaving message legitimate important signed grab beer warren thing paranoid missing call hoping leaves voicemails she probably that stop paranoia however 
i'm sure i'd get much unexpected conversation would voicemail share friends 
voicemail screened call like dope knew calling people thought recording first listened actually treasure vm life would loved thanked person really cool 
answered dc number weeks ago phone glitched tried calling back go which scammers also presidential candidate would 
saw screenshot someone voicemail if would blocked unknown left you rest easy miss 
got one said sued fire department 
new ones like say there's fraudulent activity social i'm going non bailable arrest warrant whatever fuck 
you submit post need fun sub 
i'm sure would coherent gushing much love supported think get picture 
know feel great vm fuuuck 
not sure if look elizabeth warren phone number gives office personal indeed area code 
in grim future fire fighting for all who want it 
yeah sure using personal hq mass 
don't give ideas buttigieg trolling forum speak 
freedom letting americans choose level fire response right family 
jon lovett pod save america warren's fourth place finish obviously disappointing she should be president 
this close endorsement get people pod save 
knew lovett warren you could hear voice whole time however understand psa guys feel like endorse candidate give fair coverage 
he said early process would sleep like baby warren president agree sentiment 
feel like i've head lovett outright say warren president qualified definitely endorsement gain traction psa listened political podcast us 
was heard explanation half new hampshire access boston radio likely kill kinda helped understand finished less 
this specific guys starting get annoyed influential people know president endorsement would help refuse endorse idk saving face work hedging bets life death election 
warren pretty good path nomination she peoples second choice candidate pulls moderates progressives as people drop benefit with bernie rising moderate voters may decide give little ground go want full socialism said low minority support relatively high unknown rating blacks compared biden sanders so room grow campaign season goes also unfavorability ratings like dislike highest sanders https www washingtonpost com context washington post ipsos poll african americans jan cda bb health still factor record achievement especially this get scrutiny near future now aoc signaling plan could fail waffling meaning found better look bad thrives town halls interviews time speak less debating see shine relentless fighter confident fire 
episode prior one said if warren man she'd fucking points 
fantastic wish psa would endorse warren 
this great i've pretty annoyed psa lately they stressing small percentage electorate voted far yet messaging right bernie going nominee mean i'm bias ew really it's way soon say there candidates downright early 
whatever think merits looking good nevada south carolina super tuesday may last stand 
i've listening awhile try stay impartial possibly feel like lean towards warren however seemingly time states go even must useless sidelines given proper look media result country 
they warren guys far tell 
they've favored warren long remember 
don get wrong want fantasize secretly text banking senator warren couch labradoodles night at time currently video instagram page says bernie track win nomination lead caption giant bold opening seconds really upset saw made comment irresponsible media narrative self fulfilling going cover like part hedge everyone else 
yeah absolutely although jon favreau seems lean towards buttigieg far opaque 
but let real would supporters bernie buttigieg biden 
the listened left wing podcast least think shapiro gets listens weekly ugh either way pod bros endorse they're party guys their ideological getting whatever dem wins elected 
he said part joke podcast review iowa should make official 
yes though lovett leave it frankly entertaining psa listen 
and new hampshire weird they lot independents libertarians massachusetts haters year people still undecided booth her underperforming surprising it really bad narrative combatting electability question especially erasure showing iowa lighting candles harry reid get fence pledged delegates nevada 
heard definitely new info why would local media beef specifically perplexing say least 
heard thing made feel better 
think stoush bernie really hurt i've fan warren years soured 
they democratic podcasters understand formal endorsement anyone listens show made clear team warren and people wold swayed 
psa gets ton shit far left bernie supporters if look things like chapo trap house endorsing anyone would result attacks crowd trying stay neutral keeping side party unity because necessarily feel 
it still want good terms whoever end president endorsing primary could make difference someone giving access later 
she said low minority support relatively high unknown rating blacks compared it true real worry enough time catch if drastic changes campaign reach voters needs 
they've getting caught narratives recently left warren lot conversations 
only delegates assigned there's still time 
i've listening awhile try stay impartial possibly feel like lean towards warren well lovett particular he line last week man she'd points verdict accurate also seems healthy correct disdain pete 
they served wh joe vp least one hosts delaware that said think like warren 
model yesterday predicted sanders none roughly equal chances getting majority delegates 
but bernie sanders track win nomination like three months ago stated joe biden would agreed statement well they're going data 
thank they broken pretty hard bernie lately getting chatter secretly warren's camp coming 
favs warren guy he really showing early since dialed back appear neutral 
as pete stan wanted leave comment fav definitely leaning toward warren but became much objective somewhat neutral battleground states polling showing trump beating frontrunners started wilderness series learn voters person 
saw tulsi sign driving today the one i've ever seen believe someone actually like enough plop yard 
this decided even going vote there large field honestly feel way versus others 
listen shapiro time try avoid hearing one side jesus christ makes hard not voice grating runs ads every minutes feel like listening terrestrial radio 
what respect view strengths weaknesses candidate dispassionately they know keep stressing we're team their dissections biden's example harsh honest political podcasts rallied infrastructure around organizing democratic candidates they've got far sight 
she's good constantly shining light klobuchar seen big moments amy returned favor if warren keeps going cemented media electable woman 
new hampshire weird kind sums think warren gone wrong she appealing working class switched sanders found campaign bit exclusionary tbh perhaps intentionally something rhetoric when spends time explaining healthcare system going work seems resonate college education voter turn educated something intellectual elites things maybe loses ma looking possible either figure new way delivering message drop 
many nhers moved specifically escape massachusetts either afford ma vibe culture politics 
as said episode people think boston liberal media harsh conservative they blasting years much villain hillary 
think anything particular strong right media 
why would local media beef specifically perplexing say least the reason hostile progressives everywhere wealthy owners corporate consolidation she's progressive spend time focusing 
you got narrative this talking point everywhere it original insightful clear attempt gaslight tear woman going work 
it's sad came believing based emotions think misunderstanding said 
the stoush brave enough tell truth sexist thing man said even though knew get blowback men hate called if think leaked obviously cnn shit stirring her camp prepared handle 
does vermont city big boston wide reaching radio media 
forgotten indiana minnesota not neighboring states there's reason amy pete outperformed warren nh except media bias two region honestly boston radio goes hard goddamn miracle beat republican incumbent senate seat first place 
has everyone taking point forgotten senator mass 
oh yeah know mainly referring democratic establishment women groups got behind hillary immediately many hinted believe liz would far best choice whatever reason theories never mind stumping way and really needs 
beating trump take precedence potential future access 
there two states pete klob gonna fall next if bloomberg take feel many moderates flock warren compromise 
klobuchar turned around single debate she needs breakout performance sanders hanging dry think we're gonna see gloves finally come 
removed trolling yes reason primary process includes states instead we continue primary nominee selected stop arbitrary points give nomination person second delegates distributed 
any ideas could counter do continue drop facts warren twitter i'm sure every campaign's supporters mean of course able back also find way gain control narrative 
very true personally think else done know twitter internet exactly reflection real life i'm sure media outlets still factor data gauge type articles release believe warren thinking loud we can't wait country come senses would rather talk biden's chances winning bernie pete totally omitting conversation also ahead 
dan pfeiffer rest one delaware soft spot biden definitely prefer warren even straight say air it's hard read lines 
yeah tell favreau warren guy listened lovett leave it psa kinda sounds like bernie supporter start listening pod 
oh absolutely point supporters every candidate sleep well warren president candidates problems others 
you point left heard side how much cheat lie everyone writes get shit together 
think listening shapiro described hearing multiple sides that implies parties interested providing good faith arguments based reasonably understanding reality neither typically true imo making assumptions listen follow popular right wing media though informed want know trust regular law enforcement keep track even there actually people far side spectrum engage reasonable facts understand beliefs and useful drives belief system they believers whereas limbaugh much selling brand forwarding cause 
yes let everyone hook needs get stuck bloomberg first course existential threat democracy bernie biden 
think underestimate working class understand basics healthcare plan they details important guess easier believe bernie's magic wand require effort get passed 
switched warren sanders found campaign bit exclusionary tbh i'm bernie supporter even find statement highly ironic face value that said think wrong overall it almost seems like access information made politics dumber you need big simple strong ideas break noise let people latch onto the plurality electorate solidifying picks last minute nobody's homework gut feeling votes ever 
the city protected catholic priests raped children decades imagine 
given told reporters record right happened never mentioned clear whether misunderstanding neither felt important enough bring publicly cnn dredge notes spin though warren's campaign just came forward used draw views debate split progressives give centrists path win fact warren took heat asserting story even want go public unmitigated bullshit certainly feels like media large saying shut women 
what's sad expect conservatives look blasey ford attempted rapist kavanaugh expected better people claim liberal progressive but happened bernie's supporters went vicious attack warren calling snake liar completely misogynistic bullshit it well beyond disagreement meant 
whether said would argue bernie greater credibility warren really issue it's handling i've loved long time policies pretty good imo way better dems plays politics bad highlighted 
as supporter warren warren years straw broke camel's back audacity speak man prefer leader free world meek submissive unless happens penis makes projecting boundaries strength commendable rather drawback 
know it's frustrating lot organizations hold back respect voters where corrosive elements coalition treat though pieces game board hard watch team players democratic party hesitate express opinion indicate heavily sen warren that's way goes we facing major league pitching whole primary guys playing aa ball 
but hillary fundamental threat status quo banks democratic mega donors thus wealthy power broker whose material interests aligned literally preferable sanders we're wild uncharted territory nobody knows what's going happen every article read last year clandestine dinner meetings democratic leadership stop get behind included explicit dislike warren essentially unacceptable bernie unthinkable lot people party would rather check michael bloomberg today roll dice november let elizabeth real 
if capable level interest public good politicians first place we broken political system disproportionately raises self interested narcissists highest levels power 
longer take anything granted amy going well nh warren expected better looking tangible ways campaign make assumptions based polls the last time looked sc hot pete catching nv he apparently best caucusing directors race explains overperformance ia since forethought hiring people count discount easily many inclined 
think short major win one states huge fundraising endorsement news like obama says party unite warren going get much airtime media already counted iowa since attacking they're devote air time they want drama playing game anymore 
there decent chance single candidate get state delegates necessary win nomination that mean whoever need make deal one lower ranked candidates form coalition the longer warren stays power shift nationwide conversation toward policies goals regardless whether frontrunner voice influential she stay long 
journalist live online newsroom budgets scant what get lot cheap reporting regurgitates journalists reading twitter americans use they literally create narratives whole cloth average people see snippets pay news anymore think actually reflect reality 
new ayanna pressley backing elizabeth warren 
ohhhh shit that's big you knew something endorse bernie rest squad makes sense given they're congressional delegation also i'm sure might want run warren's seat step becoming nominee

hell yes sticking together people cut ties politics based endorsements 
aoc said still supports bernie liz 
unsurprising given liz bernie dynamic at end day visions america overlap quite nicely it question think process likely achieve vision 
you friends still think differently level headed people love 
jeeeeeesus people really trying push purple heart emoji aoc calling pressley centrist i'm going back bed 
wish vocal bernie supporters would follow aoc's example like not necessarily heart emojis definitely less how could bernie's the true progressive sellout 
doubt would it people try stoke candidate rigged flames tend trolls 
of course aoc said team 
thought sure rashida going endorse warren held back but week later warren made multiple visits detroit district highlight redlining auto union strike environmental racism 
also i'm sure might want run warren's seat step becoming nominee ding although think joe kennedy would vie well markey challenge fails 
how big aoc ilhan's bernie endorsement considered nbd sub weeks ago 
not many vocal bernie supporters really jump excommunicate people support senator warren presley krasner example hell starting get antsy aoc 
ignore clowns most informed bernie supporters knew coming hard feelings good liz 
like bernie warren pretty similarly honestly i'd subscribed subreddit asshats twitter similar irl supporters fine though but yeah kind called mile away pressley state also neighboring district politicians incentives follow think pressley's vibe little lack better term establishment friendly sanders aoc words and longer history politics

that sub one big echo chamber 
um https www detroitnews com story news politics rashida tlaib endorses bernie sanders president 
tlaib already endorsed sanders jayapal interesting she got office supported bernie rode progressive wave washington state since close pelosi dem establishment her big thing med all support warren proposals my honest guess might stay neutral major activity happens race 
it almost like people agree everything get along 
she went tweeted lucky two strong progressive front runners 
actually think way around the process similar though still differences long term vision world view different two one believes system beyond fixing envisions moving economic based profit exploitation else wants improve bernie supporter socialist sneaking look guys saying warren would make decent president certainly better others vote possibly even campaign depending stances general candidate understated 
you get memo everyone named bernie sanders centrist 
love bernie voted would happily vote nominee agree it honestly turned bit 
know couple folks real life different people comment tend avoid political convos hearing everything deep state excessive use msm head 
pretty angry joe kennedy challenging ed markey seat done much good country seems like decent human he one favorite senators there plenty awful people congress could chosen challenge needs back earn place senate attempt force best 
think pressley would favourite replacing warren 
joined sub week ago think big deals 
name quicker way get people discount opinion calling someone else part establishment 
yeah one squad totally fucking establishment democrat whatever fuck think means 
know bernie supporters fine obnoxious ones aggravating 
thank from comment section secular talk video bernie vs warren when stop saying we'll wait elizabeth clarifies positions she's unclear vague on purpose that already says much i'll take guy that's clear since 'warren's theory change must kinda beg rich people less cruel elites go unless fight these trump levels delusion guys live fantasyland they're idiots 
maura healey also strong shot senate seat but ayanna amazing would nice two great choices primary like 
aoc pretty plugged ground stuff she whole campaign also great questioner committee hearings 
if establishment supposed insult think people like went public service specifically wanted make change know best way system within 
jayapal co chairs house progressive caucus lot stake terms political captial others it would crazy anything stay neutral time 
bernie supporter agree percent both warren would god send could get either 
as think economic systems processes society uplifted lower class understated upper result in words kinda comes semantics 
economic system based profit exploitation would mind asking policy differences sanders warren illustrate philosophy 
heck someone must forgotten cc one 
in europe even bernie would centrist as supporter i'm happy refer his policies warren's preferred americans that makes centrists measuring stick american public yay 
undecided much primaries several close friends rudely dismissive second learned cancelled hillary aligned bernie policy kind behavior really kept getting fully board one things that's keeping distant have friend lives opposite side country experience 
liz refused commit key issues anyway fascinating insight 
seems logical sanders support every muslim congress omar ellison he strong among muslims nationally tlaib donor networks heavily would unusual endorse 
see like markey also joe kennedy lot kind vibe getting younger leaders senate congress since 
well chuck baker would get appointment and suspect kennedy beat 
shortmidwicket actually gave perfect answer question response calling hillary clinton shillary 
compromising others working existing political mechanisms mean lack principle similarly casting blanket accusations party theoretically work insisting way else indicate 
that also get anything done they coalition build alienate people would allies 
are suggesting warren supporters principles know want aggressive pursuing i'll agree maybe last one but that's elizabeth level headed planner already shown ability fight corruption create change the thing needless aggression get enough anger shouting current potus i'm trying win angry this coming bernie supporter 
they lack principles vote incremental change like senator sanders 
yeah bad apples if check twitter large contingent bernie supporters proactively stating cancelling pressley pathetic wrong 
why martha coakley third time's charm 
i'd say misunderstanding connotation word reacting defensively also currently enough information make sort judgement either way it seems like qualify every politician establishment based using 
imo party leadership keep mouths shut things so jayapal right thing making seem like deciding makes whole process look illegitimate eyes people losing end 
would advise read issue pages workplace democracy corporate accountability https berniesanders com issues 
in europe even bernie would centrist where exactly germany france classic centrists people like merkel macron sanders solidly left basically everywhere unless personal definition centrism anyone part marxist leninist vanguard make sense 
so live belgium work policy hear time really true american politics map neatly onto europe due huge differences history culture representation parliamentary systems for example social democracies scandinavia much left wing compared us tax also strongly free trade focused well right though issue tbh bernie the main political arguments big points part support state programs like healthcare education accepted default even far supports things surely suggest ultra parties afd vlaams belang democratic party yes universal paid bunch issues go way commonly fit spectrum know people trying move overton window bring talking point massive oversimplification 
just picture elizabeth warren young bailey 
wow new vineyard vines ad campaign great 
do wish made distinctly bourgeois choice buy purebred instead adopting 
removed don't better things time trolling candidates' subs 
think bailey gift husband so technically choice 
not saying sad think bailey wh mean thousands rescues go unadopted golden retrievers demand dogs abandoned january cool give puppy christmas present wish ew would acknowledge adopt shop better general 
true thousands dogs abandoned every january either breeders overproduced holidays unprepared people gifted puppy christmas it sad thing gift purebred white house demand 
i'm mod i'd rather wasting time removing dealing trolls that's job if stop trolling dedicate useful things win win 
grateful toes every grassroots supporter chipped help raise million third fundraising quarter together building movement going put power back hands people 
campaign manager roger lau email supporters said people made contributions campaign third quarter the majority donors gave warren first time period average contribution since entered race new year's eve estimated given warren's that's amazing momentum continues nbsp hey folks know we're glad fundraising number our sub's goal double amount donations subreddit end december can think here's donation link interested https secure actblue com donate redditforwarren you'll get donor flair 
oof regret pitching little chance oh well definitely donating quarter 
that brings year's numbers contributions individual donors grand total senate campaign transfer included that's average per donation donor this grassroots movement 
https twitter com yashar status warren raised second candidate behind bernie she also million cash hand arguably important number 
bernie supporter it warms heart see two progressive candidates fundraising whole field biden million behind congrats warren progressives grass roots funded 
think i'm shadow banned posting anyway sanders warren vs buttigieg biden harris https twitter com ryanobles status 
also biden piss poor million the progressive movement strong people 
darth vader voice impressive most impressive she raise million last quarter that five gain if case second highest growth candidate 
alright i'm gonna set recurring monthly donation weekend was wait clear leader emerged democratic side it looks like time 
hope results warren sanders especially two combined puts stupid biden electable narrative rest 
amazing news love progressive candidates dominating field just like polling figures fundraising numbers rising soon 
wish us feeling warren bernie could join forces now shut biden 
great number liz obviously really sad lighting money fire primary could better spent general especially senate races 
seeing strong grassroots support i'm still baffled committed taking corporate special interest money general election 
no regrets this outstanding quarter campaign caps great couple months really good news us support warren we need keep momentum february 
the fact individual donors incredible she build movement ground we might get million end 
per donation i've heard number i'm bernie excited see warren pulling similar numbers it shows strong progressive movement 
and cash hand already making couple large tv ad buys february 
the cash hand close bernie clinton end even though two that's pretty good https www businessinsider com presidential candidate fundraising 
the progressives move nice see inspiring get sisters brothers got lot work ahead 
she also million cash hand arguably important number yeah money raised vital going 
progressives happy numbers general our grassroots movement growing 
it'll interesting see fundraising evolved along quarter we'll wait oct i'm hoping article like one https www nytimes com interactive us politics democratic html 
that really bad biden he raise much yang brought million between numbers recently falling polling might even tougher time fundraising quarter it seems big donor money going buttigieg 
it's pretty rough lol it shows people really enthusiastic biden 
think super important donations growing well polling she candidate continues grow every metric 
that would make biggest gain belong yang million really impressive 
trump going hard negative biden ads we'll see affect biden's voting block 
warren spent ton money ballot races especially maine take susan collins we make change democrats majority 
she taking special interest money general election you misinterpreting widely circulated videos context said would lift ban high dollar fundraisers that something sanders also banned kind still ticketed limited tickets rest but means commit hosting yang etc in cases big huge difference donors both bill gates capped per cycle the way donate pac maintained more details reading found https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments cjcguc case warren left 
small donor donations luxury we place time picky beat trump if wins second term he's going rip country apart obamacare gone abortion rights migrant children die the climate fucked courts stuffed century he break campaign finance laws solicit help nations take money every shady corporation dark group possible cheat lie obstruct disenfranchise way given chance now clutch pearls funding purity guy using dirty bomb restrict bb gun warren thinks without big power number one priority beating whatever takes 
in time period warren bernie got small donations trump pulled and need spend primary whoever democratic candidate they're going massive hole money everything also nothing but think way senator normal sorts fundraising calling businesses broken ceos jailed if that's corruptive power us worry 
so far warren's gotten new donors respectively adding another december totally doable 
imagine unironically calling warren progressive 
she one candidates seen running tv ads sc far really count tom steyer 
know easy get frustrated bernie bust mentality see online commentators truth people think like we fighting candidates strongest following among field many followers happily support warren nominee supportive shut personally certainly better regard 
come dude fuck divisive bullshit celebrate warren don shit dems be like 
dirty loaded word it's money senate campaign yes include sources individual donors 
yeah dare spend money donated knew would spent we wanted keep swim around like scrooge mcduck instead you know responsible 
these kind purity politics help anyone 
damn straight can't wait vote either bernie warren ge honestly think would ever position one two progressive candidates increasingly likely take nom 
ah must posts good insight race looking broken like sanders warren vs rest field 
pete's gonna overperform iowa yang think that bode well biden 
never million years expected know demeanor ubi believe best antidote automation cool 
thanks trying clear misunderstanding the two commenters making excuses apparently false statement mine 
imagine dick people might ask vote bernie general do want fundamentally change course justice country smug child unironically calling yourself progressive 
so true taken money special interest 
yes https www washingtonpost com politics sanders warren grassroots funded 
how would impact whether morally correct shouldn't calling everyone 
know excited sanders best quarterly haul think million this quarter candidates running truly grassroots campaigns warren yang surpassed the movement address country's problems bold proposals growing people ready change 
there might approval process place posts cut spam people intentionally campaigning candidates there's one group particular likes asking questions turn around promote candidate's single policy 
hope as someone warren ideal result iowa wins pete taking second that really hurt biden main argument electability 
basecamp group facebook friend added his online support definitely strong 
tbh personally mind pac money they barely made warren senate campaign contributions also clinton general it hardly anything top never received said pc business pacs ideological groups like planned parenthood emily list dedicated reproductive rights but wants ban money even buy influence anyways access getting check mail make anyone likely support lot big race smaller local races get starts mattering little closed door fundraisers drinks music dancing schmoozing really comes and swore primary sworn forgo special access keep open that important thing got right opinion 
come know warren's another center right democrat the mentality beat trump how's going convince people vote doesn't also want sanctions venezuela not progressive eh sure she's far better biden trump others gets elected obama 
while annoyed join party work within always appreciate runs president democrat instead becoming non viable third option would help elect trump 
biden totally divisive that joe th place fundraising mega donors maxed enthusiasm 
there's real sense frustration amongst many people us reason trump well apart clinton's campaign choices electoral college russian interference tapped groundswell support left behind explosion wealth power top society we increasingly new made find fewer hours less security lower wages higher debts ever something give this amazing grassroots progressive untypical candidates one sign need advocate changes system work average person 
yang truly impressive well hoping warren administration would bring board tackle ai automation issues provide input specific like vats 
that thought well fair policy 
i'm okay think either warren buttigieg would stronger nominee better president biden 
think actually better warren first biden fair distance second buttigieg if going donor class rally time abandon 
world warren center right pls gtfo 
perfectly fine think warren beats buttigieg much easily biden right lot democrats prefer fear candidate beat trump argument way really well starts bring different democratic groups together the donor class going support matter general rather supporting 
if buttigieg biden going donor class rally time abandon hmm seeing downside 
if buttigieg biden going donor class rally time abandon that's already happened despite polling low single digits pulled money last two quarters candidate 
same but single viable candidate done past at end day reform campaign finance overturn citizens united certain point need money get defeat superpacs corporate interests backing gop right 
well i'm new zealand would centre right 
thinking may right terms strategy grown sour buttigieg past weeks making biased 
it's crazy think way biden checkered past hillary clinton there's lots republicans target makes even crazier trump ask ukraine make shit kids even though warren ahead nationally still leading 
the downside would buttigieg may stronger competitor biden primary progresses but kept thinking given buttigieg's weaknesses sc nv actually weaker 
but single viable candidate done past bernie sanders from understanding pac money he's ever received labor unions at certain point need get defeat superpacs corporate interests backing gop right and that's exactly democrats lost seats throughout obama administration https www quorum us data driven insights obama democrats suffer largest loss power since eisenhower ask currently well know democratic representative house aoc she principled democrat accepts small dollar donations actions all republicans say she socialist venezuela should warren become nominee start taking big billionaire hosted fundraisers trump going correctly bash head hypocrisy getting rid politics 
so voting upcoming us election politics why fuck 
buttigieg definitely second favorite candidate like biden fairly low bar 
it crazy think way biden checkered past hillary clinton agree possibly riskiest possible candidate he like problematic less upside opinion they right straight white man lot name recognition even though warren ahead nationally still leading trump really even worth looking early hypothetical general election polls mean nothing https fivethirtyeight com features take seriously believe best chance support policies people get excited turn vote suffer weaknesses many voters decided point voting willing third party either choice you give something we win saying bad vote replace someone seems campaign main argument also uniquely skilled explaining root cause problems policy solutions average americans understand 
that's fair point warren's buttigieg along booker would rather top warren happy whoever wins although happier course 
bernie sanders hosted high dollar fundraisers taken pac money played rules warren led pledge followed year actually you read thread sent high fundraiser mean schmooze donors it means lifting ban ticketed continued use workaround tickets priced ran prices jumped back 
say said originally nz i'm living us 
feel way pete's social media gotten kind pretentious lately he's trying gain obama type appeal 
that kind least favorite thing general he seems like really smart guy respect career far but couple months ago read article life story coming first think great came brave knowing political ambitions reading younger years living entire towards goal becoming president everything done make better presidential candidate someday know sure turns little bit prefer compelling reason running someone always wanted 
warren presidential candidate participating first national gathering muslim americans politics 
as usual beats rest pack punch it's authentic love candidacy every day i'm glad reset support warren 
is biden strategy avoid every single event except absolutely vital ones it really feels like sees lazy stroll need put effort 
truly love liz wait president 
this speaks volumes reported press 
think great shows priorities treating people like matter on hand attack ad others busy schedules i'm sure none would say go could see positive negative make 
knowledge viewpoints ammunition bid win election 
rather misleading title candidates sending videos still participating 
biden bill de blasio ignored invitation kamala buttigiege castro refused invite do guys believe good look warren attend event especially live stream 
yes authenticity key think learn anything horror referendum way politicians typically campaign in age social media getting know celebrities real people pandering look i'm like popular product love insert name famous local eatery fly anymore liz could go let's say philly wawa actually liked coffee okay nothing beats dunkin donuts respect hell 
she also lot free time since zip fundraiser 
doubt authenticity think much actually work she's always incredibly hard worker direct realized congress workers most good campaigners fundraisers know they're donors tell she stepped job requires feel true aoc there's reason questions stand done needs say expose bad things really it's wonderful seeing representatives passionate right thing committed making happen 
https twitter com berniesanders status lang en 
he spent almost private jets last quarter fly around closed door fundraisers 
feel expecting get nomination back obama working 
he good speaker maybe realizing say little outdated maybe using hillary strategy trying damage possible run clock 
it if generates negative attention others showing even sending video warren part focusing campaign whining media campaigns love her style seems paying really well 
big difference hi i'm think guys great vs sorry can't person i'd love answer questions might 
because wants hear concerns represent act best interests americans 
first cares she shows attending second going representing everything that's representative government supposed work 
can't respect dunkin garbage born raised new england say agree general point 
that's something bernie could make good use well since fundraisers either surprisingly much love support gone beyond way warren 
she's definitely one hardest working senators shows thoroughness questioning actually disagree members congress least democratic side putting legislative effort she happens stand much seems way 
i'm glad bernie warren speaking nationwide conference still noteworthy even remotely my comment imply better rather candidates go beyond 
the amount waste american political system 
eh think carbon emissions flight worth face time presidential candidate she's got leg everyone else worse case telecon look much less engaged 
making policy religious considerations something i'm going support let gop garbage 
if religious event call one arab americans politics would suffice religion as ethnic minority treated extremely unfairly need support respect i'm denying but acting like islam something see represented government silly 
have seen snl dunkin donuts skit that shit cracks 
dunkin hell lot better starbucks that's saying whole 
love usually there's warm feelings bernie go many comments trashing warren despite heavy supporter lean towards election can't man gentler often wholesome discussion buttigieg's sub feels whole lot better 
he's got foundations build though massive head start 
he really done amazing things he's liked powerful sides his lack press commonly polling nd place candidate progressive platform best bizarre likely deliberate 
well many can't push hard depend dialing big money donors 
she's but muslims concerns safety discrimination freedom worship 
really drink much coffee hate donuts philly many great donut places hard eat chain then fair compare local chains national large regional ones 
feel flirted supporting sanders seeing warren well initially picked steam felt like could support winning candidate still loved really respectful general opponents his surrogates though much and unfortunately attitude affects many followers shame strongly believe good things 
actually seen quite positive comments warren small minority basically like take enemy hillary etc upsetting think going help get votes vibe goes along warren's vision future fighting 
that make even easier reach gatherings grow support 
fight equal protections law already much religious influence government 
yeah talking coffee really eat donuts much i'm goddamn fiend 
oh saying understand still early days contest you'll time next year wait position established warren work thats see pushing hard i'm glad really good hope guys end bernie options will think others goes 
agree see warren going event something positive 
christian influence want religion government either pretend like islam minority little power 
i'm pretending keep religion government 
great argument call black people tokens called carson one do honestly think he's anything tool gop he's example good ones frequently used discredit plight african americans pick bootstraps like ben 
hi i'm bot linking direct images albums image https imgur com xdutv png source github autplayed imguralbumbot why blob master readme md creator np reddit user ignoreme message compose subject deletthis delet eub lep 
politically ben fucking hack give shit person he's terrible politician gop tool problem dehumanizing multiple demographics rest party fuck carson but keep attacking character since clearly run anything valuable say 
warren kavanaugh 'should impeached' like trump 
and right even though senate important make clear stands issue 
they need give full abe fortas treatment investigate ethics problems resigns utterly humiliated it sexual assaults money he said hundreds thousands dollars debt buying nationals tickets everything stinks high heaven would mistake hell 
hopefully warren let trump kavanaugh get away crimes office too many times republicans tear apart country continue irreversibly 
while agree warren filibuster bad voting legislation still good nominations special would never made bench needed votes moscow mitch fucked us next years hope replace rbg within know long 
at point even care evidence kavanaugh needs impeached and trump go jail bigotry charges 
just message clear senate impeach it hears trial may vote convict remove house votes 
yes think we're watching see anything not afraid shake status quo like warren just need she'll back says 
is still right considering victim verify happened never filed complaint mean lawyer so surely understands due process rules evidence 
his debts mysteriously paid and kennedy sudden retirement son connection deutsche bank trump loans 
can source nationals tickets thing never heard 
they need give full abe fortas treatment investigate ethics problems resigns utterly humiliated know nothing guy makes think enough sense shame see and whole landscape tribalistic he'll unconditional support republicans say he's railroaded might even really work humiliating manage convince everyone partisan smears liable 
this exactly filibuster bad it's useless ignored matters getting rid help democrats playing field may encourage discussion better procedure 
special would never made bench needed votes but merrick garland 
yeah agree it sucks kavanaugh court think trying impeach probably failing would accomplish anything contributing ongoing political polarization supreme court want judicial branch destroyed toxic partisanship paralyzed legislature 
that's true clarification necessary people understand process even though senate convict remove kavanaugh would precise way phrase 
impeachment simply means become able level charges someone necessarily convict crime 
facts evidence get republican talking points 
here ya go https www theatlantic com politics archive new strike kavanaugh season tickets 
he may leave court think definitely feels shame think bombastic confirmation hearings bothers right wingers defend well know but least get satisfaction ruining name 
agree i'm big advocate for filibuster right it works everyone abides conventions tradition even people disagree tool even think good one if anyone stops working entirely worth keeping crack forms we've reached point ditch and want comity deliberation senate we damn well pass laws amendments side can't unilaterally abuse system 
think ship already set sail due moscow mitch's actions 
think filibuster place old school style it issue care enough stand senate floor ramble hours withstand public pressure jobs where get trouble stupid cloture votes allow party say intend allows everything 
warren purge fbi wingnuts arrest kavanaugh and remove filibuster 
think unlikely purge fbi or kavanaugh arrested that's bizarre but remove filibuster she'd push openly 
think unlikely purge fbi even know means or kavanaugh arrested that's bizarre but remove filibuster she'd push openly

warren rising iowa favorably viewed candidate field favorability 
dare say right wants let biden bernie take arrows awhile 
that's great news people love coming candidate more support warren see others and fortunately long time jump ship inferior candidates appeal terms nebulous notion electability 
think may resonate republican voters they're poorer message fault system rigged let's fix 
i've never donated presidential candidate since taking big money donating year 
iowa election caucus voter registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
want get hurt i'm trying temper excitement but i've still sure talk everyone social circle feels less like pipedream month ago that's 
would love see go distance give biden run money best case scenario bernie continues struggle comes rd supporters naturally picked warren 
go liz got persist sticker mail today rooting hard 
notice chart candidate referred first name all candidates last 
why picture article more male coverage so blatant bias typical media 
exactly slow rise safe think authentic way i'd imagine slower represents candidate going talking people face reach opposed letting media broadcast getting much attention quickly bad thing beto good example 
agreed shes got personal touch gets missed big rallies meet person senator sweet kind listens to old school progressive like definitely excited running happy vote 
and unique claim republican large stretch adult life something could bring comfort centrist republican voters 
https imgur com hcqomf gifv 
think primary eventually boil warren vs biden it's likely bernies campaign drags already dropping bows endorses 
bernie cash stay bitter end chooses 
not really he million cash hand that might keep race till super tuesday in got slaughtered hillary it looking good 
not looking good bernie unique donors candidate far his funding solid the people real trouble ones trying chase big with many race going max and find new that's beauty getting regular everyday hardly certainly beginning if get enough supporting go distance like warren much shes top its cool best but talk sanders non factual manner progressives imo 
the factor people start seeing warren rise siphons support sanders revenue could easily dry having unique small donors great strategy keep but candidates looking viable offer appealing solutions going lose think lot dove bernie name recognition honestly looked if fine taper find trouble 
there's certainly cross appeal bernie warren vice versa but think decent size core supporters going anywhere so possible could lose doubt funding dry as far viable still solidly top slots concern seems premature still long way go we'll see happens sense warren's new mostly people party loyalists people shopped around kamala pete etc gravitating towards hope that's what's really want sanders cannibalize other's the supporting progressives better imo 
this primary full house the filmore denver co liz 
how warren draw crowds outpolled pete his events consistently nowhere near size 
seen several photos videos crowd size denver made happy there is momentum let keep fight going 
it pretty incredible experience the line stretched back four blocks one point one question askers said pete event last night warren's blew water enthusiasm front debating making drive glad 
ugh wanted go badly chose canvass yesterday instead time today really hoping made difference undecided voters chatted everyone least liz top two 
there's live stream https www youtube com watch mfum ia mts well 
bernie liz voter vote progressive candidate best chance win nomination today national polling showing warren top two candidates dream come true hope way race stays imagine establishment heads exploding becomes clear choice flavor fundamental change party puts forward it great time america finally getting say 
watched lot rallies particularly good one she drawing big crowds fighting spirit consistently sticking values got question today undecided vs public option framed terms us needing fight get insurance every person wait around think difficult leaning coalition building skills cfpb argument effectiveness 
two tiny states desert voted 
it nevertheless persisted honestly regardless outcomes tuesday hope warren continues persist run white house think many people first choice hearts scared giving votes right lesser candidates desire lose trump if series drop really like vs sanders two horse race well even looking amy klobuchar joe biden in scenario mayor pete still lot folks concerned struggle reach moderate dems let alone republicans would flock keep going senator we love inspired 
she's struggling shame people see even winning early states still losing far much i'm end point support hopefully get cabinet position vp spot confidence nominee best candidate frustrates tremendously rest country 
really wish would expanded thinking last question contested convention the remember worked thing kinda feels like cop still though enjoyed watching rally former home state glad gave proper welcome full house 
pete appeals old people oddly enough they probably staying late cold outside standing long periods uncomfortable 
people nerdy enough attend political rally primary representative public large same goes putting yard signs sticking bumper stickers posting twitter politics etc they're good enthusiasm makes marginal people show voting day bring friends the big bulk voters habitual actually care much 
it's honestly impressive she's rise makes excited kind trans formative president need 
you sacrificed team definitely impressed grateful 
watched wow really want go rally 
yeah watching felt super energized 
man little video blurb rally needs blast tv airwaves 
thanks much linking know seems like hard find rallies links buttigieg's pop easily 
vote progressive candidate best chance win nomination the when 
holy fuck seen polls yet that's encouraging 
don't give i've text banking spoken thousands people super tuesday states there lot enthusiasm 
if nominee doubt she'll leave senate term want give gop governor seat fill as much i'd like see exec branch effective senator one best people dealing financial industry still think super tuesday we'll really there thousands delegates left consider struggling 
big changes history never came easy people dug heels fought back harder 
there much still happen this moment trump office bernie rise unprecedented unpredictable 
it's way early talk brokered convention msnbc reckless broaching topic two states 
i'm happy see support growing 
felt electric even watching stream and despite seen lot still fills heart hope optimism every time 
cbs news yougov national preference poll released yesterday 
that's true pragmatic way look surprising considering base candidate 
it basically gotcha question bernie of course cases brokered convention makes sense think likely plurality also incapacitating heart failure right might want throw support behind liz instead letting dnc pick but unlikely silly thing say front runner 
maybe think probably coalition older religious people biden past sell date could mistaken 
honest question vp ideally someone who's black nominee white 
senate majority leader sanders wins 
elizabeth warren is making all right enemies mark zuckerberg says presidency could suck facebook seems like good news rest us 
quote franklin delano roosevelt we struggle old enemies peace business financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they begun consider government united states mere appendage affairs know organized money dangerous mob never history forces united one candidate stand today unanimous hate welcome hatred 
warren presidency would zuck lot greedy mutherf'ers wouldn't suck rest us 
this headline misleading what actually says would suck facebook file suit us government order prevent break also confident win 
amazon aws tech worker staunch warren supporter love stance breaking big she uses right words some progressives want punish way look big needs broken push competition punished succeeding regulated market 
but virulent bernie supporters still call warren corporate stooge 
she oughta make ad quote spliced quotes wall street executives zuckerberg etc expressing fear hate make backfire 
yes she quoted this fight our 
true saying warren presidency would equal lawsuit us government suck facebook 
elizabeth warren among democratic front runners 
here https sfb cloudfront net cumulus uploads inlineimage six democrat variables png image results she's continuing gain ground puts impressive policies help vast majority americans hopefully working class folks hear history protecting common man corporate crimes 
imo think fallout bernie supporters would bad happened hrc many bernie also fans warren worked important legislation together me included warren dropped switch heartbeat biden much 
cannot fathom biden getting support literally one know three separate states living said anything supportive 
wow lot better thought she's virtually tied sanders would bigger lead wish biden getting much media coverage 
she needs really campaign reach black community imo best platform 
warren leads among liberals sanders men says lot 
remember folks we're great game at point soon social media battle begin earnest tweet something positive get back angry troll tweets they're bots report move feel intimidated silenced people know post stupid unsourced news facebook call false propaganda report least there's record might even reduce circulation 
we going trouble bernie biden crowd over considering gonna another shitshow 
great the traction gets better but would start looking disingenuous attacks politico msnbc set becomes viable threat win 
we another please get behind gets dnc nomination know might want important step take back government 
bernie needs drop primary biden warren contrasting rd way incrementalism radical us progressive policy exactly democratic party 
she's continuing gain ground puts impressive policies help vast majority americans more importantly seems like one impediments even better perception well many also unsure whether warren win democratic nomination election democrats somewhat optimistic although less half currently think likely general this suggests positioned spike really quickly dam breaks 
suspect said right think big boost seeing unabashed stance impeaching trump many us tired political prognostication implications representatives tasked defending constitution country criminal whitehouse whether help politically warren done first come favor moving forward impeachment 
right huge bernie supporter last cycle one warren actually got donate campaign thanks policy push 
right lot bitter ex hillary supporters thread understand difference liking candidate corporatist conservative masquerading progressive 'she's woman' 'your toxic lol they seem think current sanders warren somehow that russian bot accounts designed foment hatred among us 
he stood next successful black guy awhile 
it could company surround the moderate democrats particularly lean left social issues right fiscal strongly opposed progressives if living paycheck i'd imagine much less keen biden someone who's comfortable 
for love god people stop freaking the first debate still month away primary really even begun yet if sports league preseason right small section electorate paying attention political junkies like us following stuff daily and failed consider two front runners joe biden bernie sanders okay former vp barack obama popular well liked president alive arguably one best country ever historians rank around candidate whose historic campaign nearly unseated hillary clinton built unlike anything seen left lifetime of course stage like said debates voters know options leading names recognize but mark words support migrate elsewhere begin tune learn real apart goofy lovable everyone fond memories 
understand corporate media loves he's classic puppet politician everything help rich expense rest us why real americans support ignorance complacency best guess 
there exist moderates they're likely going heavily biden 
nostalgia i'm skeptical round robin debate stuff want warren unleashed 
same way trump able waltz election last year name recognition that's one big powers money allows blast place it helps donald understands create drama by get media outlets publish since says people click 
same no one know ia going 
you think simpler terms everyone agrees position prepares president vicepresident he years presidency popular particularly among democrats we argue extent things vs everyone else admin obama factors but average voter thinks broadly less ideologically 
this poll considering voting though at first thought people talking tie horserace it's good sign clearly warren still behind regular polling surging seems 
heard something really interesting morning listening talk radio remember exact results poll gist in bernie support came people self identified paying extremely close attention primary currently coming indicating base formed still bothering pay shopping around they know going need anything candidate best voters liz warren this suggests fan club pretty solidified it drop much neither increase thing brought camp leading 
it's actually bit surprising would expected biden lead men like women 
she's second behind bernie number one point spread biden among females warren th ties harris so tells democratic men progressive women what's 
it's biden vs everyone else right conservative voters in order progressive win either warren needs convince bernie drop early make major missteps i'm hoping personally discussed possibility one dropping 
think way early say voters we're going trouble the field could collapse two major candidates wings party coalesce behind single candidate super tuesday still wide open might looking run final election in former situation there's good chance current biden voters biggest opposition latter bernie honestly anyone wildcard's game point and get matter versus liz i'm fucking happy wins 
we really need worry biden supporters they're older conservative likely vote trump understand bernie bothering look candidates he's got decades consistency actually polling top crowded field if push came shove seriously doubt would progressive like warren moderate democrat they held nose voted clinton higher rate obama 
absolutely corporate media cut progressive threatens owners' bottom lines like using fair org watchdog personally 
it's waaaay early bernie pass baton until iowa strictly better progressives voices race debates 
suspect said right think big boost seeing unabashed stance impeaching trump this poll may th st would made enough dent back it suddenly lot salience though we'll see works 
yeah donating supporting right my state late primary process probably choose end that's great choice make 
agree said remember seeing poll stating among warren supporters bernie second choice biden seeing practically polar opposites would argue sexism play dismissed also noticed favorite political commentators michael brooks example misrepresent attack 
yup i'm sick people freaking fuck polls just spread word warren whatever candidates want remain diligent go vote primaries quit fearmongering defeatist negativity work toward something positive 
you really think biden goal supporting democratic party last years help rich expense everyone else the corporate media loves cover twice popular candidates strong support older voters black he hardly puppet former vp plenty shortcomings candidate spread toxic attitude presidency would better republican big step forward even good want 
your viewpoints bit toxic must say 
what makes think he exactly wealthy man 
if name recognition biden would tied sanders 
is way get media black coverage trump except actual policy no free airtime criminal they billions last time around 
everyone agrees position prepares president vicepresident who i'd argue governor large diverse state like new york california would way useful 
merely noting found distasteful last election sanders' popularity seemed driven primacy bernie bros they made local caucus nightmare way bullied hrc voters 
i'm afraid long stays greater potomac fever he'll get his justification running rightly lack progressive voice bluntly that's case 
she first came impeachment th may iirc would three week gap poll enough see sway 
you really think biden goal supporting democratic party last years help rich expense everyone else whether he's accomplished look corporate friendly made home state the media loves cover twice popular candidates strong support older voters black he hardly puppet former vp name recognition candidate you're right among i'd see polling obama picked get white vote plenty shortcomings spread toxic attitude presidency would better republican big step forward even good want honestly nicer doubt much interviews policies history administration indication he'll talk game letting republicans play that said yeah i'm going can't let low bar standard keep limboing democrats hurdle barely ever instead pole vaulting 
this times we must become like bernie bros toxic support candidate let's try positive welcoming still debating important ideas principles 
maybe personally find views continued support awful crime bill put together incredibly toxic 
just one source https www politico com story joe biden money wealth middle class joe biden million vacation home he charges per speaking gig inked book deal likely worth seven figures checked dollars dont problem people becoming wealthy said exactly man untrue likes call middle class longer true some prior stances actions rub wrong way supported bankruptcy reform made almost impossible discharge student loans since backed several bills make harder average americans declare attempts appease credit card companies homestate delaware terrible history terms racial issues well anti bussing crusader 's crime bill led rapid increase prison population believes life begins moment conception bad pro choice legislation usually choosing abstain voting his role confirmation clarence thomas even allegations remind much susanne collins kavanaugh looks voted for iraq war feel need elaborate dumb the smallest issue age trump why nominate someone turn would weakness strength terrrible candidate democratic party especially we younger provide better foil travesty white house right warren fits

mean sanders second framed radical many sides makes cautious people less likely trust 
barring legislation would risky area the real problem lies articles click if everyone stopped clicking sensational bullshit disappear unfortunately runs human nature we 
let's put way majority vps run president get party's nomination you reach back reagan think arguably bush big state governor although say arguable point another look whoever vp already selected shall need arise mind voter someone good enough logically 
heard that's unfortunate bernie seems like really great candidate 
http www businessinsider com bernie bro myth sanders base diverse let couple extremists paint entire group or clinton supporters militantly feminist albright said special place hell https theguardian us news feb madeleine albright campaigns hillary clinton women support hillary regardless keep eyes what's really important finding supporting democratic candidate defeat trump the rise fascism america danger need remember pushing hands oligarchy 
well progressive voice name recognition think much right run warren candidates antagonistic bernie even biden hoping either sanders drop early race support vote become consolidated if worse comes democratic nominee 
the impeachment issue became salient mueller statement 
look corporate friendly made home state delaware since th century but sure let blame biden we get anywhere silly ahistorical negativity let positive primary campaign issues save insults trump btw support warren donate per month 
he twice name recognition candidate bernie warren even adjusting best favorability rating though top tier candidates pretty close from https imgur com tepwo jpg maxwidth shape thumb fidelity medium regarding popularity among black voters www google amp beta washingtonpost opinions helped make joe biden democratic front runner keep foutputtype washington post in recent polls quinnipiac said biden percent support nonwhite democrats cnn put closest competitor democratic leaning races sanders vote poll sens cory booker kamala harris calif earned less the hill harrisx harvard leading points african american public always large sample size tough get pinpoint accuracy racial groups but numbers suggest significant backing and despite progressive record issues busing crime getting surprising polling data past election results almost uniformly liberal times happily supported establishment that makes served vice president america first whose policy stances notably decent match looking what referring obama administration 
hey let toxic toward bernie crowd edit get i'm turned supporters' sub reddit saying rise trash talking dnc front runners whoever ends candidate backlog candidates' followers' toxicity towards that's healthy last hope trump say supporter leaning warren time around 
yeah pretty grossed learned bernie voted that toxic 
i'm voting biden primary vote general madness republicans destroying rights women poc lighting fast pace allowing stay power continue luxury fucking hate much every republican 
same bullshit spread russians hillary prefer biden saying smear unbelievable be positive democrats ffs 
the point name recognition obviously helps fact recognized liked leads biden's polling lead he popular political figure america obama 
another way look whoever vp already selected president shall need arise mind voter someone good enough logically in go together this sort speculation usually fact logic used rationalize conclusion let's put majority vps run get party's nomination the democratic party process completely transformed crowdfunding advantage connected insiders like access corporate donors let smother competitors crib that's thing anymore arguably since 
need remember pushing america hands oligarchy we're working hard enough poor people stealing earnings 
http www businessinsider com bernie bro myth sanders base diverse they basically cite poll numbers show people favorable view bernie but refute bro since young white guys bernie's loudest nastiest committed supporters simply rating either positively negatively tell like said special place hell women support hillary this misleading her full quote there help something personal slogan she way contexts she's saying there's vote need notice everyone quotes reveals exactly advertised 
jesus christ it never stops 
prevent dnc making huge mistake lose votes trump ge somehow dnc's fault 
name recognition on ground biden sewed right for damn life i'd like someone track record liberal policy i'm tired writing zombie lbj fdr spaces party neglects even contest think antagonistic in greatest bastion bernie bros fuck noise voted last primary better candidate needed move left it dude's done job it's time john baptist make way jesus edit irl conversations outside groupthink antagonism terrible approach 
mean imply single handedly made way nothing make better worse 
the bernie crowd nothing toxic they attack elizabeth warren every candidate that's i've never seen another campaign dividers election 
literally head ess see posts documenting daily desperate attempts sanders supporters bring warren they one group sympathy extend 
strong believer leftist principles biggest reason support candidate bernie toxic fan base us warren g's must become like 
https youtu wuengia ywi this video bernie explaining awful crime bill willing vote compromise introduced violence women act show intentions he screaming obvious dark side consequences since beginning biden however continued defend even bill clinton signed law admits mistake 
and that's problem cycle vote lesser evil i'm going republicans democratic machine foists neoliberal choice my political white nationalism pro wall street party what owe anyone if want convince they give something 
please clarify qualifies 'smear' anything i've said you object hold biden accountable long pro corporate wall street record how unfair exactly or russian ffs also realize subreddit elizabeth warren right founder cfpb proposer significant wealth tax proven political adversary joe go watch exchanges bankruptcy legal reforms hear one gets pass wear blue shirt that hillary's position i'm not trump vote for me enough win states needed there important lesson democrats they're paying attention everyone held whatever making going critical 
you know find response fascinating so somehow think sirota joke why because he's unapologetically left wing works sanders campaign what his tweets biden point journalists' pieces biden's policies voting record contrasts to that's actually valuable basis see can't cast vote but hey stay peanut gallery laughing administration compromises republicans cut social programs pay wars hope anything important family 
biden really liked much disliked my impression people know little beyond obama memes 
mean shall see guess biden vp run since crowdfunding described started he's commanding lead think runs presidency probably win nomination probably although always all really there's precedent count anymore but like contradictory speculation old 
gonna second cycle bernie would nd palatable candidate field i'm gonna pass voting primary many internet supporters condescending jackasses zero self awareness generally less subject matter knowledge people they're 
this true regardless bitter downvotes additionally biden seriously least energizing choice democrats could make literally nobody excited bunch lukewarm statements electability name recognition yeah inspiring without using google main two three ideas going really help america climb back dark hole nobody knows probably know 
is joke like bernie pro last primary if viable liz voting strategically otherwise cause younger specific policy plans at least country boilerplate strategy peeps nobody getting butt chapped remember terribly went time 
the bernie crowd nothing toxic supported sanders support elizabeth warren what talking you're mostly full hey know what's blanket generalizations even marginally based fact 
dunno wtf ess vast generalization exact toxicity whining admit bitter hillary supporter 
agreed actually like bernie nearly much warren straight loathe cult hate seeing sub emulate subs worst tendencies 
that mean anything still signs lots people reasons mistakes it disgusting hey man know terrible gotta cool 
'white nationalism pro wall street party republicans suppress vote stack courts psycho judges can't remove makes harder give people something 'vote for' whatever fuck for example stacey abrams pretty cool got cheated governorship voter suppression abortion banned state crooked governor stole election lead women maimed killed body autonomy taken away if red one day could so yeah i'm still going sit back let nazis come power easily takes five fucking minutes walk booth pick someone utter nightmare anyone straight white man go in primaries i'll always fight best candidate make voting voting better general little time lot communities hell broken machines hour long lines laws luxury part reason hard good candidates win republican situation even worse need convincing sadists want destroy rights 
sirota joke he's vehemently relentlessly line bernie's expressed desire unify party worked sanders pretending serious journalist calls people question mentally incapacitated he's gross probably going nominee think would better biden potus see getting having guy like speak campaign ensure trump's victory loses primary when trump administration continues cut social programs pay wars hope anything important family 
thank corybooker you've always powerful voice justice equality made primary stronger know continue leader fight defeat donald trump build future america 
good show cory went really liking booker primary thinking actually alright loved say climate change marijuana legalization etc spoke issues like violence trans people color get enough attention animal welfare https corybooker com plank agenda politicians ever talk be still vegetarian heart it turns lot i'm schtick kind ott even that's taste respect energetic passionate voice cares also love rosario dawson she boss fight homosexuality overcome order achieve full gayness 
liked booker lot he obviously number choice i'm sad able make latest debates drop 
booker would better vp choice castro 
iowa election caucus voter pre registration deadline https mymvd iowadot gov account login returnurl fvoterregistration january www aclu ia org en find caucus site february general sos iowa elections voterinformation index html november 
with castro gone i've lost top two choices race sen warren sad see happen 
just last week called media criticizing ew things criticize truely good guy hope sticks around someone else's warren's campaign 
elizabeth first choice love cory booker also julian castro we great candidates 
in perfect world booker would've frontrunner besides warren like candidate shame see go 
booker excellent candidate charismatic speaker executive legislative experience rhodes scholar happy warrior attitude one best climate action environmental justice plans field with castro gone longer second favorite 
look forward voting booker future he still got many rounds left wait see next move 
booker great guy feel would strong candidate almost year much like castro chance stand would still excellent vp pick though 
gained respect booker election cycle feel people educated past align lot warren currently stands https www wnyc org story booker gets wall street house senate member one point receiving money wall street anyone congress next line behind mitch mcconnell even mentioned book dark money publicly criticizing obama campaign negative comments finance industry made he said right things history dubious practically dem candidate consider progressive additional source washingtonpost com world national security newark mayor cory slams obama attack romneys work bain capital giqapvjudu html 
love friendly respectful warren always party great quality leader look pelosi 
definitely agree vegan really cool seeing someone promote animal rights bit sad drop early 
also love rosario dawson she like boss fight homosexuality overcome order achieve full gayness this amazing made laugh 
went really liking booker primary thinking actually alright he walked back support charter schools main issue not just school bit general neoliberal privatize public goods grift represent it showed learn mistakes 
he definite number two choice personally i'm sad see go appreciated voice perspective race debates feel like really anymore luckily vote super tuesday i'd shocked liz drops think i'll worry much miss booker glad still fighting progress senate 
my number two well if end going moderate path would strongly preferred biden wonder happened likes steyer bloomberg claim need put money behind kamala rather entering race things could look different 
warren booker dream ticket since day 
one advantage pairing castro may helping border crisis trump created 
not enough geographic diversity imho castro texan massive 
castro part obama's cabinet though having people team bad thing especially right 
i'm pre debates point actually 
same lol castro liked harris booker 
he senator nj quite lot people live work wall st thus represents significant amount money anyone understands system designed expect support like surprised warren took biotech firms defense contractors ma 
yeah booker pick vp would signal liz's entire life lie its going happen 
in video announcing dropping said would supporting whoever nomination seems less likely wonder could where find quote 
warren staffers saying days they've got big endorsement coming just wondering get 
they've got big endorsement coming oprah 
iirc https www youtube com watch diejvjahblo last ditch effort turn straight it almost worked 
think steyer moderation he's full bore progressive like sanders warren he's long time climate activist wealth tax part platform 
same facebook showed post made jan calling 
i'm sure since border he comes state run statewide office san antonio far could see status latinx candidate sending message voters immigrants refugees represented warren administration that's definitely important but think specific expertise experience would help issues 
according make much difference https fivethirtyeight com features overrated vice presidential home state effect 
slow roll it'd contradiction certain things stands i'd expect explanation saying it'd signal entire life lie absolutely absurd not she'd pick anyhow 
building broad coalitions accomplish goals make liar 
she's going iowa then new hampshire nevada south carolina https media tenor com images bc daa bcedf gif itemid 
to add castro never run statewide well known outside san antonio served mayor it seem like texan status would translate much even things tend matter if going pick appeal texas guy came closest winning recently beto o'rourke 
taking vp someone wall street pharma money funneled senate campaign would absolute hypocrisy warren 
he senator nj pharmaceutical companies wall st employ around state his job represent voters many ties businesses if sectors would bad would surprised discover warren biotech firms senator ma surprise one active sector remember senators country whole 
almost every democrat wall street pharma money point purity politics help progress if open bringing new people coalition never get anything done 
did click watch gif yes 
removed rule campaign contributions bribes allow comments accusing democrats corruption receiving 
exciting foreshadowing minnesota state fair 
this soybean poll mn state fair today though leading whole time 
voted also bought warren pin 
minnesotan make sure show support warren go fair tomorrow believe minnesota deep progressive roots lot people think midwest needs moderate voice actually need opposite 
speaking polls the poll finds virtual three way tie among sanders warren biden presidential nomination preferences registered democrats democratic leaning voters across country compared monmouth june results represent increase support significant drop way lead dem picture shifts https www monmouth edu polling institute reports monmouthpoll us sincerely hope next year choose greater two goods 
those straw polls scientific value yet can't help keep track happy warren leading side note buttigieg keeps well that case iowa his actual great lately seems there's grassroot support would indicate 
beto take cue hickenlooper run senate he's still popular think cornyn much vulnerable defeat cruz 
how work everyone gets one bean 
think people love union strong messaging us minnesotans unions also feel campaign gives wellstone vibes 
another poll came today showing normal distribution for monmouth looks like major outlier others people get excited 
sample size small maximum margin error 
speaking polls majority said clinton would win polls shit 
as best could tell time went warren klobuchar buttigieg sanders harris democrat biden yang 
looks like biden far left klobacher sanders harris tallest shortest 
think performance audiences mn ia white midwestern national significantly boosts appeal he's still quite well early states main demographic college educated whites larger percentage population on hand biden really crushing straw polls reasons make 
poll minnesota state fair she home turf advantage 
you spend minutes answering demographic questions giving email address state democrat party dfl get one soybean suppose could multiple times addresses that's lot effort light hearted non scientific poll 
yep far bigger sample size love know morning consult finds early state voters backing steyer though 
that expected confidence interval most opinion polling sample size around people but average poll adults national council public polls faq http www ncpp org node sample much depend population counter intuitive many companies use samples stats stackexchange com questions ddg this good job explaining math https sciencebuddies science fair projects references surveys the mathematics probability prove irrelevant unless exceeds percent total examining means equally useful opinions state would city surveysystem sscalc htm 
the majority said would win popular vote and learn polls mean discounting entire segment math statistics 
the polls states inaccurate national pretty close if understand methodology shit 
biden behind tall one far left buttigieg you barely make two name zoom when go back i'll try grab angles next time the fair also runs labor day keep everyone posted 
if can't even lead home state needs drop even o'rourke share tx 
you track polls https www realclearpolitics com epolls president us democratic presidential nomination html 
he's apparently dumping money ads iowa early states easier cheaper get individual state polls national guess but even seems really high 
yes point sample size basic statistics as long representative need large and yet always first thing people fixate especially skeptical simply dislike results 
yeah still lost so good polling it literally worthless 
that actually makes happy get support biden like person time past 
buttigieg seems well types polls he got nd iowa corn poll state fair used mechanic corn kernels doesn't correlate national polling right 
in meantime here's snap first saturday fair https imgur com rvwz png day three different angle puzzle names warren already way ahead got bean took buttigieg friends 
actually many minnesotans like president the common sentiment hear stay minnesota she election vote would say though city pages article reflect feelings pretty progressive readership 
yeah uhhh well locally http www citypages com restaurants minnesota state fairs worst new food amy klobuchar waffle though least name recognition 
it's time stick comb say 
oh sure see couple percent get also want know hell people looking trump thinking need another billionaire wants buy presidency that's question 
iowan watch single youtube video without seeing steyer ad imagine much money pumping 
look know bernie made appearance speech it looks like proportionally better yesterday photo wonder alone difference 
assume people think fight fire to give steyer credit dude bankrolling causes like gun control voter registration turnout impeachment years but many dems big money politics even supports can't see ever getting real traction 
there recent reporting he's spending like per day something insane excellent example need closely regulate money politics 
bernie marched civil rights biden embraced segregation honestly idea minorities would support 
biden support pretty weak half hearted suspect mostly name recognition rather embracing issues behind 
his mpr interview started saturday probably it definitely day the guy got survey needed complete bean wearing shirt 
this things stood saturday late morning beforehand https imgur com gallery imjxrfn 
like notice specifically phrase you say anything good defense stood racist senators segregation era positive racial dynamics just know himself he uh enjoyed hanging hearing views politely debating salmon tartare lunch lafayette idea anyone would look field biden actual history of action go yup guy gonna fight tooth nail justice 
no biden yes https www nbcnews com news nbcblk joe biden compromise segregationists fought 
nice try strawmanning that said minorities know biden support among appears stem mainly connection obama implied continuation policies not love specific medicare proposals foreign policy ideas go read fivethirtyeight believe frankly find past positions like bussing crime bill refusals apologize less though disagree edit minority progressive weaker people think 
quick somebody get bean counters working images 
lol phrase anything purpose you're reading way brief response know worth discussion everyone evil except bernie people politics 
no love discussion especially put either harris warren top spot you make assumptions socialist also tactical voter 
just know racist himself he uh enjoyed hanging hearing views politely debating salmon tartare lunch lafayette this give impression someone willing conversation bussing shitty situation asshole racists boston it ended setting bad situations violence terrible parents aunt's uncles went friends we've discussed length now let go day for christ sake irish mob even contributing whitey notoriously opposed busing plan sponsoring militant pro globe kennedy homestead brookline the black students increasing everyone quick call guy pile shit case extremely complicated but god forbid admit i'm people or first hand 
if say get candidate support trying understand build coalition tratia and defense statement wind know worth discussion everyone evil except bernie people politics cobrawine nice building good sir you really showed progressives who's unwilling conversation 
did say advocated no why feel need twist words order defend guy defended segregation 
she simply best candidate it's depressing like sanders can't shake feeling lot popularity idea that's drilled people's brains one fighting that another level care anyone else true he's human made mistakes he things judge critique would perfectly happy president however sit look words thoughts warren undisputedly better wish faith people done decision instead going preconceived notion gold standard 
charlotte raised warren past hours 
this sort outreach candidate i'm tired way highway order day looking someone spent lifetime building coalitions that's democratic party core coalition people similar somewhat divergent ideas hope warren comes stage hungry hippos every waltzes plans stolen without credit different said deserves president america president like we deserve see crisis horizon rest easy knowing leader skills keep loved ones safe speaks us equals rather dividing categories loyalty says everything alright believe never lied damnit wrong fought tooth nail make truth fighting till last breath leaves body truly reach snatch primary else usual get 
it's great see real candidate go way reach voters especially lgbtq community 
could someone explain charlotte loop please 
human beings tend favor stories narratives what's real stories exciting pure tailored imagination think story sanders draws many people and that's great thing inspired lot get involved political process but past warren particularly negative see she flaws we've seen years man says fights gets motivated presidential candidate lifetime 
it's depressing like sanders can't shake feeling lot popularity idea that's drilled people's brains one fighting that another level care anyone else feel sometimes i've working trying ignore ultimately happiness bernie elizabeth candidates potus really dependent people think get electability arguments thinking whoever president consider whether supporters thought could better mood since started focusing line makes even biden pete would massive upgrade trump much less stress anxiety i'd daily rather jerks twitter reddit whatever doesn't excuse honestly matter end said hope mental exercises nothing warren wins nomination way bother 
can't shake feeling lot popularity idea that's drilled people's brains one fighting that another level care anyone else probably narrative campaign spreading onlybernie literally trending twitter debate warren crushed bloomberg's windpipe personally find insulting towards supposed good friend progressive ally talked thought sexism would hurt chances trump but low information voters gonna vote 
he essentially became meme election young people certain ilk decided even started ride die bernie point online harassment without looking anything happened glad ran brought lot important topics national conversation blind fealty extremely concerns 
as bernie supporter hope think would foolish liz involved majorly sanders administration 
so share unpopular opinion kinda i'm fan warren given current results polls sanders run away something would significantly change get nomination which bad liz bernie strong but president followed if win election years just pondering wondering warriors think 
this her outreach railing establishment issues feel like primary runs place air grievances makes inclusive candidate 
idk liz story much compelling woman midwest grew financially challenged interested politics early life she became special education teacher went law school rose ranks become harvard professor despite male dominated field and started understanding challenges working families face country decided getting involved government would able fix problem it humble unselfish find appealing bernie but advantage tailor image since most general public opinion think guy progressive movement know fighting stick less time get national stage aligned majority american 
i'm hanging contested convention think states enough say he's run away anything yet bill clinton win single primary super tuesday hitting bloomberg last week put major wind sails hopefully hopefully please god bernie today gave momentum reason people consider instead told mil voting warren asked point someone chance said long vote i'd time brought recent fundraising polling way door event rack second place delegate numbers could make case moderate delegates superdelegates her positions plans least well researched data driven actually accomplish good thinks americans cfpb bernie's got nothing front lot rabble rousing 
think there small foolish part still hopes warren suddenly move nd place know unlikely we sure week super tuesday hits the thing say hope bernie sees past spat asks vp 
sure pretty well known grifter honestly likely making elizabeth warren called https www salon com fast company promotes live chat creepy male feminist change org stein huffingtonpost remove charles clymer contributor parentwin clyming walls feminism critical look html 
she became special education teacher went law school rose ranks become harvard professor despite woman male dominated field and started understanding challenges working families face country decided getting involved government would able fix problem this story drew candidate super star third cited scholar commercial huge accomplishment even compared professors despite coming late life creation cfpb still managed achieve many lifelong politicians rises top enters doubt make unparalleled president 
mean already polling nd nationally feel like much potential would wasted vp best case scenario co opts plans gets credit worst digs heels way highway style muzzled nothing done country willing vote another democrat years 
think pulling nd delegates completely plausible 
she smart well read insightful talented passionate also empathetic compassionate attentive understanding humble basically badass mothereffing superwoman 
woman midwest grew financially challenged interested politics early life she became special education teacher went law school rose ranks become harvard professor it's literally right 
hoping true like said waiting agony super tuesday know sure right fivethirtyeight places chances winning nomination but side little bit hope place chance no one guess would leave viable option brokered convention 
personal story i'm choosing warren incredibly important campaign in define opponent impose narrative the republicans constantly pushed idea obama american bill ayers thing jeremiah wright madrassas saying middle name countless things try paint unamerican to fight back relied growing kansas hawaii organizing chicago living dream working way harvard beyond it helped subtle ways gop tried incredible one connects men women parents class anyone bust asses work get it's motivating need general 
it's solutions also they'll good job president warren's story tells examine issues closely change mind based data realizing issue bankruptcy etc find appropriate solution great right mindset ability act believe effective implementing 
not rude feel like interpreting comment least charitable way possible i'm saying personal story reason voting initially drew and part history getting things done extremely competent everything attempted i'd say essential fixing problems people face 
personal story important many people background hard work empathy others aspiration educate improve lives demonstrates capabilities great leader 
by logic candidate much broader view counts us 
they also gave hrc like chance win election sooooo know nailed seem good since imo but point said completely plausible pulls second delegates 
personal story i'm choosing warren incredibly important campaign and better bran broken sorry couldn't resist 
competence empathy qualities think story really illuminates 
yeah sanders happy fight meant showing rallies considered fringe issues but started talking civil unions good enough people vermont fighting get married and unlike warren private citizen pulled shit guess forget conservative stances gay marriage regime change crime guns immigration 
they gave chance winning hours beforehand and better worse estimation based votes cast whereas already primary still hoping best regardless 
and better story bran broken everyone they all given back hodor crippled male kristen stewart 
for real tho honestly finale probably prescient thought 
empathy huge amount well following data feel like bernie's less cares struggles he's naturally inclined acts rebellion 
uh policies racial injustice gender discrimination lgbtq equality immigration reform reparations ask bernie thinks white males disproportionate amount power country demonstrable fact there's race disparity wealth liz acknowledges follows data listens people's lived experiences calls experience identity politics mention say prefer liz's medicare plan get right away instead wait knows long full bill i'm compromising true progressive need to see doctor now dammit politician ever donated extremely limited income money throw political campaigns first candidate makes feel heard heard pushed around try convince vote listening concerns considering options commands behind talk people getting talks fighting 
he also quite happy go rallies kept running failing political campaign trying enter politics ignoring son paying child support there's privilege came radical bernie liz 
difference see bernie narrative liz lack personal story former it necessarily bad talks know wants president exactly lot people criticized hillary with running may matter much value policy platform candidate knowing personally invested wanting hold highest office government important 
bernie talks know wants president exactly yes i'm personally skeptical anyone who's politics long aiming presidency actually got hillary law school thing married guy ended governor's wife flotus wanted able basically window dressing era probably still large degree became senator secretary state moving made sense bernie's content spend last years congress really making much name advancing beyond seemed see literally one else running may well kind shot like get warren's hell lot og obama bernie biden bit cautious maybe we'll never can't stress enough importance taking information analyzing strategizing effective path forward respect intelligence research adherence data voters would truly rather vote someone iq says going here's i've calculated happen yells revolution expects trust they're plan lead us pit full punji sticks 
vox elizabeth warren leads democratic primary field iowa 
great job everyone keep fighting finish line 
warren constant advocate progressive policy long time worry what starting though stability sanders faithful love bernie btw going forward keeps slipping polls eventually loses primary they really seem showing teeth lately maybe ass find helpful situation 
jesus christ almighty can't even sarcasm right 
i'm curious assume bernie voter yeah like lot vacillate warren excited if win nomination plan vote general god forbid biden 
they deleted comment replies think important mention bernie supporters online heavily targeted misinformation widely impersonated try drive wedge democratic field suspect saw one impersonators there good activemeasures thread long ago https www np reddit com activemeasures comments onxn prominent prosanders subreddit wayofthebern remember we're together every candidate race better trump need rally behind fight whoever wins 
wonder part attempt agitators foreign domestic whatever aka trolls make bernie supporters seem worse there's bizarre tulsi support makes sense number levels yet consistently sub also mentioned supported bots twitter the best way maintain civility appeal reasonable groups already aligned warren 
im big supporter warren bernie votes going yang long hes race believe policies best address stay home mothers main difference support groups behind seems compassion speaking personal experience supporters willing discuss ideas share information etc shoot id argue reason voting shes taken corporate money asked federal jobs guarantee better ubi banned subreddit think perhaps dont take wronf way far women warrens shows isnt bad thing anything hadnt said didnt automation might faith economic policy yangs fact missed job indirectly automate cant trust still informed 
to paint complete picture disinformation campaign democrats hits directions using bernie supporters example applicable groups including warren genuine target demographic targeted information drive online behavior beliefs become useful internally comes form inflammatory posts candidates fake articles attacking upvote botting comments containing encouraging vs group thought impersonating making assholes comebacks impersonator reward candidate this also replicated external either saw their impersonated subreddits designed get massive negative response training us associate sanders the point encourage adversarial ends becomes self sustaining feedback loop happened politics see massively upvoted claiming anyone voted gop incapable empathy way subhuman it's important understand engaging political discussion specific leveraged 
anytime hear someone talk favorably tulsi particularly right always assume consuming media nefarious sources 
you're luck taken corporate money what said believe unilateral disarmament general big donors no one asked bernie would take donor meant defeating trump someone think line attack overblown tbh as far know warren's statement automation problem outsourcing based study cited which recommend instead 
elizabeth warren plan get rural americans broadband internet 
my favorite fucking thing warren campaign keeps rolling great ideas think shit brainer of course want live warren's america bad 
butbutbut thought chairman khajiit varadaraj pai said eliminating net neutrality would bring rural americans broadband increased competition are saying creature lied us in seriousness one warren's best proposals that's something given much hot button topic internet become recently really hope helps appeal voters 
this best tl dr could make original https www vox com recode elizabeth warren broadband digital divide access reduced i'm bot warren plan would grant billion federal money subsidize building networks rural communities addresses deep us around americans areas high speed internet compared urban according fcc that largely across vast swaths expensive joe biden said invest infrastructure triple amount funding expand extended summary http np reddit autotldr comments cn xu america terrible faq fm faq version drs far feedback message compose pm's monitored constructive feedback welcome top keywords american 
this agenda pivot expecting she going start moderate dems supporting biden expect policy proposals centered around rural america messages appeal 
it's getting increasingly difficult simple things like find job homework without internet rural americans flock towards republicans someone shares discomfort immigrants gay people in turn slash infrastructure funding leave lower middle class rural important tools this amazing policy strategy warren

they'll give money biden like they've screw comcast 
it's understanding rural americans really efficient its high frequency means needs antenna every feet practical setting running speed broadband way effective 
either way risk regional monopolies the point plan expand public option 
short range it good rural 
npr intelligence guy months ago talking risks national security standpoint because much hardware closed us saying cannot trust communications secure something along lines it lot china major player providing think shit my memory shot these last three years certainly taken toll

warren leads senate calling alex acosta resign 
okay really dumb question feel like know hell secretary labor dealing epstein plea deal 
good love he gone times moreover never appointed first place fuck administration's ethical practices lack thereof hope democratic senators take strong stance acosta valuable cabinet position 
https www miamiherald com news local article html shout miami herald journalists julie brown stayed story sdny got fbi even thanked reporting 
why people calling trump resign 
sweet heart deal guy sold girls sex where outrage evangelicals say care children thanks much warren 
acosta broke law https www ft com content df ee bd resign time impeach let's republicans vote whether side man illegally rules give billionaire pedophile slap wrist co conspirators immunity plus make democrats less hesitant impeaching trump 
new york election primary party affiliation deadline https voterreg dmv ny gov motorvoter february voter registration april general voterlookup elections state us votersearch aspx october november 
he prosecutor similar case involving epstein decade ago 
you really read http nymag com intelligencer know new case jeffrey epstein html 
he us attorney one give epstein deal 
acosta epstein attorney first trial he responsible getting plead guilty receive punishments part plea deal codefendants said case one donald trump could tried crimes related 
see excellent idea raise resignation entire administration 
literally everyone calling resignation anything without impeachment 
in epstein sentenced barely jail time allowed leave six days week go work after sex trafficking dozens underage girls 
he federal prosecutor miami epstein attorney acosta coordinated sketchy plea deal basically amounted slap wrist significant crimes there increased attention past actions prosecutors ny brought similar charges 
he resign time reason longer protected criminal prosecution though 
importantly acosta also got immunity co conspirators trump likely one so anyone else involved incident can't prosecuted this given labor sec position 
our country disgusting shit show 
oh acosta even worse thought 
i'd bit cautious pegging trump co conspirator yet vox good article goes connections epstein tenuous best https www vox com jeffrey epstein trump bill clinton mean serial sexual harasser accused rapist could see liking acosta simplu getting easy think like gross job interview but think early speculate whether guilty crimes 
i'm speculating repeating jane doe model brought charges trump four different orgies epstein hosted initiated sexual contact last time tying bed raping in court filings declaration employee says personally witnessed encounters go acosta's deal epstein's lawyer dershowitz exempted prosecution rape process edit the miami herald great work tracking check consider supporting check justiceforkatie com https well 
yeah that's actually one vox article points kinda flimsy if read right withdrew accusation it could absolutely true i'm cautious jumping gun fairly left leaning they're hesitating inclined that said hope dig bring everyone else find along scumbag edit thanks links also original herald report yet need that's journalism supposed 
she withdraw accusation dropped case fear 
warren pledges to release impeachment docs withheld by wh 
this one reasons impresses much sees problem thinks steps ahead address that good leadership have candidates said anything like come post trump anti corruption plan recent she really showing chops trial 
gonna stupid win she's everything need right 
yes she really leading fight ahead rest everything 
this great understand platforms anti corruption seem resonating iowan electorate compared everyone else's status quo policies 
god hope wins support love avoiding let's move forward rhetoric we can't acknowledge done 
would wh commit destroying everything doesn't seem like breaking law much deterrent one 
pledge prosecute trump barr pence pompeo perry oops nunes rudy and russiagate kushner dtj 
to fair potential democratic president might withhold info tulsi gabbard ha 
this like ya love plans hope house senate pass but stays red mcconnell refuses single piece legislation warren plan good exclusively office president she best person job 
the good news shown need president make dreams plans reality cfpb i'm absolutely voting confident future can't ignore 
because members my party corrupt they angels republicans corruption problems long vote dem good 
because people control media terrified 
also we're fine imprison kac ivanka violating hatch act 
also impressed nyt interview her fluency policy government full display she subtly hinted understanding bold visions would meet opposition parties sometimes settle incremental advances as voter pragmatic expectations president reassuring hear 
i'm less worried senate holding things look trump he makes laws go effect passing house forget term executive privilege can see bernie day one signing stack pre wrote 
i'm really hoping wild swing obama trump equally matched direction warren overcorrecting corruption could potentially thing sets us positive path forward repeal citizens united get nationwide election security voter enfranchisement legislation passed everyone's votes counted 
my first choice strong consumer agency harvard law professor federal bailout watchdog said interview huffington post second plenty blood teeth left floor 
never thought that's probably sigh 
the election good shit look back need feel optimism

i'm stalwart supporter donor new orleans la red state i've senator warren since first interviewed jon stewart recession she change need capable courageous enough take inceasingly tilted economic policies multiple party differentiated special interests ultimately lead country ruin grandkid's time plant look reddit posts support senator truly believe represents serve best america

aw means much us we try hope continue see happy thanksgiving 
wonder says bernie name comes almost every time warren that said would focus less supporters actual policy 
agreed thanks fight if want send us donor receipt remove personal info get flair 
he outspoken beliefs tries brand progressive pioneer regarding policy exclusively prefer warren day year bernie 
warren takes top spot the root's every democratic candidates' 'black agenda' ranked 
well that's gonna get traction politics bernie th what subs share 
there elizabeth warren black agenda blackest unfortunately also seems invisible everyone except mike bloomberg but keeps punching face debates 
they make ad shows tops like every scorecard 
what wanna know pete ranked high 
this last thing put warren camp that analysis positions voting record says progressive candidates so i'm going donate canvass weekend california 
how tom steyer low his campaign built arpund reparations slavery giving govt grants hbcus 
see tops list biden buttigieg gtfooh 
i'm currently getting voted saying changed registration democrat early vote warren that sub gone full cult status 
post buttigieg sub for real that's pretty good rating one woke writers america 
the wording first sentence great friend 
usually say holy fuck article bad there difference laying facts offering opinion straight letting bias dominant story also dude self proclaimed wypipologist quick google search https www dictionary com slang tells someone studies white people explain crazy things 
frankly can't recall scorecard topped 
because five candidates worse exactly bragging rights 
because ranks ridiculous warren's probably best racial justice biden second ridiculous 
the ranking mixture pete getting high scores actual good plans low michael harriot like buttigieg legislator 
because based plans policies tweets random people 
the power rankings change weekly depending candidate week 
he probably hired great consultant develop plan make appealing black voters we know weak spot 
canvassing warren weekend california well south good luck lfg 
dunno though possibly idea old rich white guy waving free cash handouts black community expecting go nuts quite come across nobly would expected 
it way early delegate winning candidate drop matter think what's happening not voting since understand point right yet the true power support losing brings beating trump well lead supporters get behind warren's chances seem slim would silly earlier next week as much comment coming place logic passion fear trump another 
this hard read made sense i'll shift support wins nomination fail see supporting candidate feel strongest primaries results sanders losing general what earth even talking the whole point vote preferred blue matter election 
this happened clinton vs sanders 
also primarywarren trending twitter if need anymore evidence trump like mean terms policies tactics 
got voted hell kid contemplating bernie president warren replace schumer senate majority leader they damn peevish can't even respect enough acknowledge would great 
actual comment saw today really getting sad warren supporters keep defending choice it like want trump 
really because see alot pro warren talk least since bernie took solid lead it's sub much bernie 
looks like deleted reposted neutral headline 
know existed politicaldiscussion also sub overtaken completely bernie obsessive followers they actually pretty normal discussion warren staying convention 
is new voteblue got banned jokingly saying primary mods thought funny apparently need dem comradery fix back 
sounds like another sub i'd get banned keeping real 
my bad it looks like posting 
it's direct quote linked article 
the root serious journalism outlet mainstream sense they gawker like owned company owns former sites it going top opinionated goal objective analysis average reader these types targeted specific audiences already share point view part satire humor activism loosely based journalistic practices 
seem biased mean would've easy give bloomberg stop frisk redlining actually good trying buy presidency gave pretty high marks economics education even criminal justice despite disagree warren's black agenda comprehensive actionable 
read methodology reasons gave biden really seem convincing 
they reasons you may disagree would effective say based policies plans histories etc rather gut feeling candidate 
are questioning metrics they explain conclusions based number points disagree genuinely curious 
before ron paul the sub always goes full cult presidential election years 
that's rather hilarious election suspect large part reason chose run top still new holding public office probably wanting step hillary's toes bless lost even would worry seat taken republican took opted secure year bottom fell she'd years senate put pieces back together save political cycle absolutely nobody going remember primarywarren actually time primary lol 
she would can't help feeling though president dammit she'd incredible secretary treasury who better charge country's economy but let's focus getting elected 
do mean comment points people either agreeing preferring vp complaining support president 
i'll take word see warren articles that's 
it pro bernie sub all top articles jacobin commondreams praising you get downvoted dog piled even suspended team 
yeah gave neutral headline kind figured get much traction 
better biden pete though like picking broken leg root canal 
biden getting much credit obama's work feasibility yeah easy plans feasible anything he gets points vp candidates done talk black lives constantly referencing obama 
oh god forgot ron paul favor white male social libertarian populism first foremost seems 
because woman going seek power detriment particular man shall punished accordingly it's called backlash the value women according supporters candidate loyalty 
because demanding drop since iowa bernie voters delegates apparently warren fault already 
https www boston com news politics elizabeth warren superdelegates 
that's easy get drugs root canal i'm better end day 
biden worked black boss veep surrounded people smarter susan rice michelle obama eric holder jeh johnson this might seem like much eight years listening something white ever done not saying agree strongly author weighted good point unique experience none candidates 
well give points actually working listening black people office fair like biden maybe little high see endless talk black lives matter experience intelligent important 
yeah easy plans feasible anything reminds much snl warren town hall plan differs exists one asks we're gonna pay 'remember obama i'm little annoyed giving biden credit standing next first black president basically there's pretty deep cynicism electorate mostly expect get dicked matter wins they're trying hedge bets whoever white people back trump office starting see biden's support drop bernie's rise warren's really budging 
mean yes promising things could never hope deliver lose points feasibility category specifically that's literally supposed measure 
look understand passion idk wrote thesis merits sanders' plans way long i'm really interested defense sanders reasons this warren sub if i'd look literally involves politics supporters taken work the root idea went metrics though imagine involved details also african american can't speak perspective candidates whether believe platforms accomplished that aside point reiterate think stated platform nd warren terms criminal racial justice that's coming primarily staff let's stop right he's running president he owns and weaknesses due means effective leader issues surrounds questionable advice leadership evident takes speaks judgement personally talk cows come home who's actually gotten shit done everyday americans voting 
very true backlash one specific thing think spoke ill socialist jesus 
what realize drops bernie going lone one debate stage at least warren he's got ally progressivism 
it's superdelegates even though socialist jesus wanted straight reverse majority popular vote want live planet anymore 
think issue less weighed assumption surrounded meant listened someone spent years actually listening black people would said segregationists nice never called me 'boy' 
because biden large part chosen acceptability white moderate obama courted nascent progressive movement see little reason believe biden's tenure vp somehow endowed special kind wisdom makes good candidate people color let alone points intentionality 
right that's problem measure it's easy score high setting bar floor 
sorry said genuinely curious issues someone could ranking gave reasons it intended convince vote sanders even concluded end warren better he owns platform staff and weaknesses due that means he's effective leader if surrounds questionable advice leadership evident takes also speaks judgement think misunderstanding i'm trying say my argument good staff's fault plans bad opposite actually quite primarily result leaves things desired would never come something comes race topic super comfortable discussing 
go away chapo troll https www realclearpolitics com articles rand paul calls new populist libertarianism html economist democracy america unpopular impolitic en wikipedia org wiki libertarian socialism 
it's backlash running bernie apparently entitled progressive vote when argument could made maybe year old man move back younger woman but that's blasphemy 
frankly disappointed see transparent self serving bernie form superdelegates good give nomination bad someone else mention fact supporters buy wholecloth 
saying root canal definitely better broken leg 
why picked detract fact worked years they say special kind better white people the obviously relative field 
it's almost like marginalized people care probability things actually get better best ideals 
sorry said genuinely curious issues someone could ranking gave reasons ok fair clear enough responding suggesting biden high trying get biden's results of course anyone take issue intend conversation my argument good staff's fault plans bad opposite actually quite primarily result staff leaves things desired would never come something comes race topic super comfortable discussing ah see because wrote second part assumed meant responsible way thanks clarification following

dude said he'd address racial injustice social workers teach black families raise kids think learned much anything working people years 
this favorite attribute warren being man per se disqualifying course falling stereotypical male trap showing humility willingness change defer delegate turns much ofc i'm voting blue general matter 
literally presidential aspect it's called administration better plan comes along good administrator recognize adopt give due credit the fact done several times candidates dropped shows would run office without ego looking best solutions rather ones could take 
think everyone adopt inslee's climate plan like warren 
this kind attitude favorite she close sanders policy love demeanor no trying score points based wrote damn bill just get best policies possible working others acknowledging contributions 
love open listening perspectives humility always put good policy ideas ahead ego incorporating inslee harris gillibrand giving full credit even willingness read yang book hallmark great leader warren candidate consistently that ticks end klobuchar buttigieg accuse way highway crap nothing could truth 
her ability create ideas worth policy position main reason started admiring back early 's describing collapse middle class https www youtube com watch akvl qy explaining high level economic principles way laymen could easily understand recognize contributions others adapt superior rather reinventing wheel hopes candidacy history especially recent history makes fear primary electorate would prefer bombastic man quality near unparalleled competent woman however 
think great quality it's unfortunate many changing kind seen weakness but could also see yang maybe sanders 
more people need read the fifth risk michael lewis it explains another dimension trump hubris endangers america 
if khive twitter believed stole kamala's plans 
this such great move way start bringing us together senator warren 
think maybe booker would done he'd great vp 
hope trend continues field narrows get closer nominee the best ideas move forward party another candidate plan specific issue absolutely adopted this good leadership looks like 
what said would longer believe things 
the presidency reward best ideas gold watch put end good career it incredibly difficult job done well properly rely experts come great successfully bring real world thinking planning big but separate administering passing warren candidate administer pass people decades 
she also adopted bernie's medicare all plan he's still race think different pay raked coals plans largely like willing able pull others' ideas platform it's best worlds imo 
agree love willingness adopt others' great ideas bring tent speak it shows certain intellectualism awareness many politicians lack 
she dang awesome what wild inslee fit standard model successful pres candidate well spoken governor success position think shows upside things traditional drops polls poorly though could make case northern would come south la bill clinton 
think everybody adopt mlk poverty plan guaranteed minimum income like andrew yang 
bernie's wrote damn bill comment made response moderator questioning specifics medicare never saw trying score points acknowledgement fact well educated subject matter author also appreciate senator warren's willingness listen implement new ideas like supports if i'm lucky enough liz bernie candidate i'll thrilled 
hate true why hell 'flip flopping' toxic political gotcha can't even make mind want eat lunch every day god forbid candidate presented new information think critically change better position some us would go far call learning 
had idea toxic khive today it possible seeing vocal minority extremely hostile warren reasons find outreach aa community exceptional seen negative things say most accounts relatively new people tho could bots 
member give though twitter we got upset media ignored things kamala proposed begi reported warren jumped board blame getting press still bitter candidate great ideas always called cop as rape child assault provider knew back hopefully take kamala's excellent 
not normal male macho think action heroes especially 's they rebels ignoring advice consultation others solving big problems police chief that's hank give badge you suspended quit goes kill people rescue child 
if talking negative stereotypes yes is typical male probably 
she developed plan likely ofc stop believing things kind question even 
look cfpb great example strong administrator it's done lot good everyday people since started also proven difficult trump minions dismantle subvert although likely need tlc sane administration gets back power 
luckily plan immediately changed system throwing insurance benefits union negotiations chaos she getting closer public option bridge 
warren's plan laid exactly plans implement making gradual process towards complete the transition takes aspects bernie's pete's etc for example warrens would cover every person younger individuals whole families poverty level first days expanding medicare coverage covers including dental vision hearing similar bernies warren temporary buy option people age range could otherwise get sorta in combination also greatly expand ability aca greater use tax credits removal deductibles max co payments lower cap bunch things take long type mobile main difference bernie lowers year so four he'd covered one also seems try everyone else legislation passes able becomes universal even pass congress degree 
inslee also inspiring speaker rather dull which love governor 
my main problems inslee lack name recognition know one candidates running think climate change candidate could win we known crisis years but taken strong enough measures combat warren's focus fighting corruption weakening power lobbyists first step taking long term action time make worth progress undo new administration 
you many people stirring pot inslee really stand same beto kamala three would good candidates others like pete biden warren bernie race 
he one candidate unlikely win wished stayed whole race talk climatocalypse 
think best way fund ubi wealth tax as producer surplus taken owners capital instead work wages needed become the specifically increases revenue proportion necessary focused fewer people bring it policy yang really 
bernie's wrote damn bill comment made response moderator questioning specifics medicare the first time he said every debate since none context think bad person got really good reaction line pollster probably telling be sure say it goes well base 
thought response tim ryan saying something along lines you know would cover debate stage 
think responding typical attitude someone supports candidate bernie freaking wrote course better bust type toxic comment fair also supposed seen kind unbeatable comeback 
'flip flopping' toxic political gotcha unfortunately complex question on one hand point we absolutely want politicians look new information think critically change minds don't got elected specific promise even attempt fulfill any politician vote knows dire consequences acting climate change would beyond upset voted someone declared crisis chinese hoax 
missed spend time reddit fb started use twitter last month volunteering realized they're bad worse red rose berniebro twitter 
mean general sense platforms probably candidates warren even attributed kamala booker black maternity plan added something 
it may typical male certainly fits politician cant even remember last time one asked permission policy 
then ask permission just develop 
it's theoretical point anyway plan candidate might actually pass two different things people aghast say yet exactly like native american dna ness the press likes setting win situations 
which personally think wisest policy dems take general election i'm midwest anecdotal legit terrified gop machine make losing issue 
interesting actually loved orator pretty dull hehe 
think would better need inspired every years voted best interests future judged people based track records pretty words 
you correct believe line used initial reaction positive think wrong use satisfy base speak supporters though that's part american politics look number chants trump incites rallies yes obama campaign example 
haven khive ers face bernie bros definitely russian internet trolls either worried support win trump voters 
obviously easier expedient sometimes people good ideas you clearly use alt account antagonistic 
she building coalition nitwit we need everyone board solve big problems one person waste time inventing wheel got perfectly good wheels work 
disagree inslee first choice still running also recognize voters like great communicator president 
actually econ master's student from tell plans dodge historical problems wealth taxes leonardo davinci drawings flying machines never worked wright brothers built there's where would world decided flight impossible past think passing wealth tax easy administering one either but worth things even hard 
politicians gotta politic you right think amber fool say not trying score points based wrote damn bill wrong use satisfy base speak supporters see exact way different reactions which totally normal two people typically react stimulus 
this main account trying antagonistic see big deal 
get also quarrel coming plans regardless someone else similar one different 
how wealth tax plans dodge historical problems 
to show together waste campaign money rewriting policies win support candidates camps give credit due do think one would say anything released plan similar former opponent no people accuse ideological theft asking permission integrating ideas smart and proper thing 
one biggest things start million meaning far fewer people deal way lower administrative burden another really big one two thirds wealth held financial assets like stocks bonds closely businesses retirement accounts etc once add real estate vast majority can't hide ownership all squabbling last questions art fancy cloths wine even piss poor job accounting items still get accounted won't hoarding art avoid tax two major answers if try loophole we pass new legislation close fixing problems code not thing fixing way currently taxes beginning hoard ton form done given lot money artests hope someone willing buy need cash it basically giving away hopes different rich person give later 
no one accused ideological theft took mantle public option like buttigieg or considered sell signing onto bernies medicare plan sure correlating action togetherness winning candidates camps appreciate credit due think big deal listen attacking warren huge imo 
thanks explaining it sounds like costly implement oversee read irs said audit poor people often resources richer so another expense bloating government least right say though personally increasing funding crack rich scammers trump 
for one thing hear time warren watered version bernie sanders copied https www google com url sa rct esrc source web cd ved ahukewj vqxx crmahwjct khaofdeqqfjalegqibhab fthehill fhilltv frising panel warren copies sanders money politics usg aovvaw xsv rvu sdcgymhpat sh also literally answering questions bc understand would ask candidates plans 
it sounds like costly implement oversee yet revenue brings least right say well right also saying mueller report exonerated trump call summery nothing wrong food stamps socialism leading country people looking hand immigrants collectively bad the things enough reason avoid good policy do think rich avoiding fair share taxes either advocating low major form income capital gains pushing loopholes deductions benefit everything business expense creative accountant literally breaking law persecuting white collar crimes proper levels decades you can't fix improving current tax system if ended every single loophole tomorrow would problem that money gotten counted wealth only wealth tax history codes their exists resides stable healthy functioning taxing ensure continued health stability functionality even 
hey warren people come beto sub peace something share concerning two candidates trump comments 
agree message very smart thanks cordiality love way beto run campaign wish supporters best luck only warren camp 
seen multiple interviews warren asked respond candidate stance issue she will not bite simply reiterates discuss policies criticize candidates every volunteer know one exception tries follow lead when beto supporter stops table talk strengths nothing good say this sincere my tshirt buttons stack campaign literature clearly express preference need insist better we listen another still prefers continue support either way goes away feeling positively done job people responding cordiality respect sanders showing despite media attempt start left war they teammates rivals the needs horse race narrative moving trying split centrists impacts harris buttigieg ends spectrum pushed pick side several debate stage reminded audience nights everyone republicans with actual voting months important trumps work weakening dems 
don bite right agree it little crazy realize sometimes person arguing orders essentially putin the work enrages global tyrant enough spend millions hours rubles trying stop us derail do let derailed if conversation devolves yell abyss walk away they power 
appreciate reaching brother hope stay united right wing propaganda russian interference drumpf's awfulness we need focus agree left every candidate wants universal healthcare every fair humane immigration system corruption washington end etc keep forefront minds fact want things may simply different ideas get here usually strive educate rather shout sympathize others rationalize away cognitive dissonance that's makes us strong let's internalize go win election drumpf russians 
great message warren current favorite i'd vote beto heartbeat gets nod 
this exactly right political messages case trump's racism truly un american words actions get across they require constant repetition so important candidates supporters stay message scared bots concern trolls saying stick health care pocketbook issues the better i'll defend even otherwise favor biden instance 
great post reason attack fellow democrat pushing change there times step away minutia infighting present united front this one 
huge fan beto loved senate run speaks clearly honestly unfortunately really love warren want woman president time fell list but supportive message campaigning white man presidency would pick thank hope stays public figure long one way another 
it's really nice see old beto back last week hope keeps progressives need stick ever want shift democratic party line values kick closet republicans curb

warren rourke could good ticket decent balance terms age states gender ideology etc 
question do support beto mostly texas if things stay poll wise vote primary still choose favorite say three likely candidates 
we're bite back friend one appreciate lot 
we embarrassment riches primary time highly capable ethical brilliant figures like sanders warran buttigeg beto castro while i'm personally pulling warren i'd glad vote quite others running see often minor differences policies positions suspect supporters feel way yes we're vigorous debate future party hopefully country stage election mean hate democratic candidates somehow impact fact ultimately together the enemy candidate even really voting block hatred intolerance anti intellectualism fascism private centers power want keep hands people 
the word racist charge leveled mr trump democrats primary debate last week monday interpreted white voters reflection supporters according academic research study duke political scientist ashley jardina found calling policies turns linking behaviors supremacy leadership https www nytimes com us politics trump html 
it seems like evidence needs given facebook beto campaign fbi copy correspondence do democracy 
greetings like beto really wanted try another run us senate texas obviously i'm rooting warren appreciate candidates agree holding trump account hope make second choice edit also got see person here's picture https imgur com stygzgr jpg bernie des moines pride forum flack friends think cool getting along even disagree stuff 
think yet another chance show unity we cannot divided petty differences both candidates responding well they're putting country ahead response republican hate machine 
i've really glad see beto showing bit fire belly right i'm leaning warren moment got nothing love 
we very supportive elizabeth warren bravery calling spade moment calls politically easy hey fellow democrat might want read article phrase its eytomology racist refrence modern times problematic https www npr org sections codeswitch call thanks postive message like beto 
so disinformation fsb bots starting already and know electronic voting machines vulnerable hacking almost last time maybe that's trump hour private meeting gave putin codes swing states put anything past actually said foreign government information nothing wrong taking mitch mcconnell lindsey graham especially sketchy duplicitous we months they could easily use paper ballots takes 
good call warren gotten hit botnet attacks first announced tulsi gabbard announce since obviously also putin pocket nothing live beto stay hyper aware thanks heads 
wish beto would run senate 
imagine pathetic must feel joined russian military expecting stories brag friends spend day social media fellating bigoted american fatass mental capacity three year old 
right love say educate warren really set tone inspiring policy depth campaign built see effort live standard beto 
vote de blasio heartbeat gets nod delaney williamson guy never heard whatever once primary cannot afford quibble preferences 
huge fan warren as texan dreamer soft spot boy presidency something would love live she gone beyond top tier candidate obligated say trump taking political risk calling brave damn well respect texas fighting one since hits close home 
fully expect beto top everyone vp list he deliver texas california northeast and partner whole game 
god wish criticize yeah comment true bernie wonderful activist base needs rethink strategy 
it us mess huh sigh 
that's low bar lol those toxic nutterbutters driven far away i'm liberal sanders i've even responded kind mods ban matter open discourse thing definitely very happy sub tho everyone non groupthink nice 
non american bernie supporter really rough 
realistically think beto running veep odds point catching fire taking prize low resume thin compared front runners even much middle tier really wish castro would run senate instead need good but yes lot said slot boston austin though old political hand foreign policy credentials might needs relative noob 
like beto lot campaigns structured organizer mentality first foremost he went counties state realized key winning red actually respect scale ground game need win enough individuals swing voters top also activate many non the town halls minute stump speech followed grassroots see policy platform changes reflect things get brought that kind deference electorate insane mean logistical standpoint there efficient ways run never cares guys willing dead tired live stream whole way it transparency powerful policy wise consider wash warren stuff plan yet list keeps growing they candidates refuse any large donor money even pete takes would rather medicare all america sympathetic argument go smoother transition forcing insurance compete national healthcare system least give chance reform since section economy built house cards democracy amazing sure liz gotten sound anything as voting vote dreamer really want base hypothetical based polls huge field skewing data assuming goes contested convention second round clear shot make progressive ticket joe ideally come joes support breaks people start tune this far us nerds paying much attention though 
yikes it's bad insult called racist white supremacy ok 
they access better bot detectors us plebs there good one called hamilton currently iterations developed former fbi guy sure whatever hidden away leagues 
the not me us slogan interpreted often extend democratic candidates want warren win guys come better ever they're going allies future leaders keep party 
also really weird people overwhelming voted debate mega thread poll night others stood 
she obviously putin pocket what idiotic comment military national security subcommittee show us actual evidence compromised russia drop thinking 
losing back senate races texas could devastating mission flip senior senator carry kind baggage junior he's despicable snake without question share cruz's un liability factor reason 
completely disagree think huge national profile work house members senate candidate flip state run governor things like fight heavy republican gerrymandering 
think pete make great vp pick warren harris 
hey man my three year old knows good people say nice things charge give kids little fucking credit 
god polite thoughtful xd there's definitely version niemoller poem head lately and trolls came candidate nobody left speak let's let happen folks 
i'm supporter candidates member subs honestly like beto lot think he's able capture media attention needs would make amazing vp cabinet though 
williamson real nose holder really want elect another charlatan but point see vote nominee please let 
i'd vote mitt romney got democratic nomination 
it's hard three qualifications https www loc gov teachers classroommaterials presentationsandactivities presentations elections requirements president html 
how even asking year he first pick many candidates qualified however white male would beto bc capacity bring people together work hard choose good seems understand needs country time willing name threats qualification immensely subjective nearly meaningless anyway opinion mostly need someone judgment current hit baseline 
also hope help deliver florida while love warren think probably would difficult time flipping state of possible vps beto likely 
yeah popped beto sub definitely see appeal warren o'rourke hopefully texans hear speak they'll woman oklahoma worked hard went far vs harvard elite combined still tons support texas primary promising if choice picking running mate 
ticket balancing that's presidential elections frequently far ensures strongest turnout party successful campaigns balance perceived weakness candidate whole enthusiastic least comfortable voting jfk young massachusetts senator balanced campaign veteran pol texas reagan right wing radical establishment bush sr seen old touch coastal elitist picked vp popular conservative middle america jr dumb ceo type got government figure cheney obama political neophyte foreign policy experience washington vet senate relations cred trump serial horndog theocrat reassure evangelicals as optimal pick year progressive woman would relatively moderate guy country the ones meet description o'rourke buttigieg castro and think beto best option assuming good enough warrant also really like run white house control could follow nice probably way maximize chances 
as dedicated bernie supporter would absolutely delighted warren candidate threads like make wish participated dialogue averse online activism the ground pro communities i've high quality activists obvious room improvement unfortunately think toxic insidious nature behaviors y'all outlined really blossom i'm mostly lurker reddit we need better stifle culture especially given foreign influence working divide collective win 
honestly little shocked tbh figured candidate subs good relationship would given two super big reformers guess bernie bust still hey least enough us come together end day 
he inspired cult personality like trump some supporters take criticism bernie lash great message hive toxicity sucks 
going talk much shit friend used bernie supporter supporting warren got call revolution and let's say response triggered rep tirade very unprofessional def turned needs said our revolution officially affiliated campaign yeah good look 
ya voted base basically cult nothing better proof attack warren consistently bernie would never fans 
like anywhere else loudest worst overwhelming majority good people get drowned loud toxic ones 
wayofthebern basically personified bleeds mainstream subs gets sporadic pushback less toxic supporters edit note pretty likely wotb sorts active influence campaigns going trump russia posters necessarily bernie 
keep encouraging people community vote i've heard there's concern among legal citizens undocumented friends relatives voting could way endanger families if overcome sentiment bluer texas actually represents come sooner think 
sure may need push look particular issue person etc also hold breath current administration fb self policing 
agree care issues when candidates i'm happy and like others without vilifying candidate frustrated us rep right support green new deal impeachment refused stand us closing concentration camps but get primary challenger voting way feel constantly pinched moderates criticize others think vote someone share values recognize easier convince republican opponent hope enough people fired 
yeah democrat want win primary point years putin administration basically here's nbc reporting russian propaganda machine backing https www nbcnews com politics election russia discovers democratic candidate tulsi gabbard this one's days ago apparently doubts assad used chemical weapons people even though literally everyone says otherwise there's plenty evidence person cites source come saying independent co uk news world americas us syria skripal mh douma airstrikes html 
actually considered one overperformers debate republican brother watching think anyone else either so would rank winners virtue improving image consider biden winner taking major damage 
think trouble red flags raised whole syria situation want say russian plant stances extremely sketchy given facts also believe rt dinner something good look https www independent co uk news world americas us politics tulsi gabbard russia syria skripal mh douma airstrikes html 
fair enough wish chance win senate think hes texas's best shot 
worth noting literally year governor could win zero say gerrymandering xd too late affect nd term would end although agree spirit comment and third pass laws important gov things etc 
warren pete would appeal almost exclusively white voters like he'd complement harris better 
fun game start road stop romney problem probably actively want country come real harm mcconnell pence nope far line almost anyone house plants would preferable current occupant head list republicans exactly graham cheney bolton scary relative trump when think nuclear football try decide scarier risk blowing world incompetence purpose 
it been real https imgur com pnfkbm 
she went college houston taught ut texan spell 
thank participating constructive campaigning yes need collaboration warren bernie winners debate working together defend progressivism radical centrists 
i'm bernie warren supporter worth progressive friends feel way while individual prefer readily admit think could well consensus candidate desperately need general election as hoosier primary occur may plan give vote whomever two progressives closest clinching nomination 
yep unfortunately take kindly optimistic outlook it's damn shame bernie rocks still love can't see possibly build anything good toxic fanbase huge fan loved everything end became consistent attacks hillary clinton took bait email thing that's i've come stick warren values policies without negativity this allows coalitions form like bringing beto fans well think lot people supported aware dangers attacking party though gotta say warranted authentic biden's record actions 
oh nonono xd see trashing warren anyone subs they seem biggest threat bernie ism supposedly enervate movement accomplishing half revolution which extremely ironic word actual socialists mostly vote much liberal give honest look https www reddit com elizabethwarren comments cjcguc case warren left 
it goes message not us bernie highlighting problems need mass movement solve led exclusively 
yeesh might want send caller feedback mention our revolution endorsed great candidates narrowly lost tough races stacey abrams tony evers record federal good get media talks shit bernie often critiquing activist group electoral politics important taking well oiled republican machine stepped game 
one biggest issues bernie time around people he's hired nina turner long head our revolution toxic vote jill hillary and trump are almost no different camp dave sirota pure political hitman little allgience anything beyond who's paying moment like lot says displays signs liking yesmen sometimes

hey make dumb though i'm sorry society failed guys way hope get build life want sisters parents ok and warren person belong period liz wants things better everyone 
oh man mean dumb means robbed opportunity 
i'm sorry feel lost think sound extraordinary 
just remember guys almost entirely result good form ranked choice voting accurately probe compile voter preferences this people liking liz approach 
exactly people keep saying warren's campaign terribly embarrassing got low whatever but votes indication people liked if narrative person can't win they're polls takes seems like becomes overwhelming strongest factor someone gets maintain ranked choice voting important thing step allow vote candidates want push progressive changes 
there states kind direct initiative get stv https www youtube com watch xozjkozfi ballot it kills gerrymandering 
hey planning participate read going but say something democrats progressives pushing necessary change right along healthcare green energy this election elections forward would much better ranked choice system it cause significantly less infighting parties candidates we could actually vote favourite without feeling like waste 
and also mainly result sexism when think back election remember folks she attacked trump surrogates dumb shit bernie people talked looks 'bossiness' 'complaining' nevertheless persist 
ranked choice voting would created drastically different election small candidates like williamson gabbard gillibrand yang etc able fare much better actually ideas put support viewed accurate standpoint similarly medium klobuchar warren butteigeg harris stay long liked felt voters connecting we needed sloppy consolidation votes happened last week totally entire race 
amen there candidates liked cycle would willing offer support many others forced pick single candidate expense andrew yang elizabeth warren missed they're part larger movement country never going away 
oh god think differently mess primary would gone ranked choice voting 
honest question difference ranked choice voting nevada caucus everyone puts top candidate choices 
join rankthevote it past time get done let make memes ready next fight 
ranked voting required honestly staple across countries australia policies place allow voter turnout qualms candidate vote person like front runner most supporters warren number two matter solely counted it created super toxic division similar campaigns splitting progressive sick tired 
we need ranked choice approval voting 
we need ranked choice voting yesterday 
if live massachusetts ranked choice voting ballot initiative november please get involved https voterchoice org 
my job see make ranked choice star reality state it needs national priority think good time really build momentum since lot disappointed people primary 
and lack ranked choice would give us biden sanders trump there's also optics warren damaging somehow general election incidentally person votes way might still vote wind exact opposite outcome based fear perception others' voting behaviors people progressive bloc there's angry gesticulating jewish old guy weird accent without people default image biases policy efficacy means progressivism always suffers 
bernie supporter fellow progressive just want say stand implementing ranked choice voting 
if could vote day would done much better love donated decent amount campaign despite broke believe everyone started dropping endorsing biden became clear going work switched bernie within hours voting super tuesday purely want president progressive values i'd rather really hope whoever nominated brings administration somewhere she deserves deserve intelligence white house 
just thought iowa nevada's caucus form 'ranked choice' voting in case warren frequently viable first round would means supporters ones going second choices 
couldn't agree liz one top throughout campaign ended favoring another candidate would easily ranked either given choice bummed things panned i'm hopeful plays role whoever ends kicking trump's ass november 
we need ranked choice warren always number two voting thing would lot power 
ranked choice voting necessity democracy dream future party system choice first major step take towards my condolences sanders supporter would extremely distraught shoe foot sorry faced nasty comments remarks support 
warren first choice would happy mark second yang probably rd hopefully ranked ballot initiative california hits required signature deadline april st by way know bernie camps always gotten along sad see actually progressive candidate go solidarity forever 
warren went stance fracking always loved main interest income inequality making economy work everyone the cfpb incredible accomplishment proved bite back bark i'm sad representative progressive policy country warren's pragmatism intellectual rigor plan thing admired may disagree implementation never doubted opinions well informed born compassion duty others 
doubt people like warren terms likability feeling approachable absolutely best problem days wants everything dialed get attention look trump vote nov the fight 
irv rcv bad better fptp imo promote voting system right one personally i'm partial ranked pairs https en wikipedia org wiki pairs anyways take lookie writeup np reddit com neoliberal comments progressive burlington vermont went running it's burlington vt city actually switched fucked elections basically allows candidates win getting weaker opponent 
yes we need rank choice vote in this country talk to everyone you know and make sure they how great it could be join rankthevote 
yes this important believe discussed widely loudly enough 
even ranked choice voting would struggled in iowa bernie pete beat got voters second preferences think enough klobachar biden votes surge same thing nh person decent share joe surpass nevada south carolina rcv take account choices winning candidates which good otherwise libertarian candidate basically always win dems reps put unless system accounts 
might wrong since heard speech back ranked choice voting cause form voter disenfranchisement along minorities less educated process convoluted reforming system realize badly candidates sure means immigrants say 
think rcv something everyone democrats would want get behind hope whoever democratic nominee pushes 
approval voting particular would ideal primary 
it seem ranked voter good way gauge candidates unity polarizing ones 
there oakland mayor years ago everyone ranked second choice candidate unity liz lot people's strongly believe speaking volunteers called voters country people said variation well like policy positions voting think win which 
bernie people second choice exit polling agree ranked voting reliably delivers results happy 
ranked choice voting would stupid current state delegate system the actually worst think need get rid threshold delegates proportionally if first round majority allowed switch etc this essense ranked choice sorts gives power rcv states work edit dolts downvoting explain i'm wrong 
loose circumstances reality everybody loved us establishment system aliens made impossible 
want allow changes accurately reflects voter preferences 
if live massachusetts ranked choice voting ballot initiative november please get involved https voterchoice org 
for sure second choice large margin sanders supporters as two progressive candidates obvious would significant overlap policies they're fighting slightly different execution 
there many candidates race she stellar comparison last long ranked voting would definitely helped 
and join rankthevote let's organize finally get thing done 
there's one issue comes right away cgpg's example in last white tiger he's making assumption second choice votes go purple likely scenario they're split candidates how decide get transferred ones if cutoff well incentive hold voting long possible rather vote early what might make sense use parties instead individuals the primary process figuring order so party got delegates white first list gorilla delegate green gorilla top becomes 
the problem implementations proposals ranked choice voting systems good forms in sense damaging taking bit extra time get right first 
just make sure advertise specifically good ranked choice voting system there many different types better others the type maine nyc implemented seeming simple surface actually hardly crap perfect blowing wad bad one would much worse leaving current slightly longer implement right we know changing anything like incredibly difficult crucial done first time possible 
yes and join us rankthevote it tiny growing really quickly past days 
thought publicly funded elections getting money election process answer perverse incentives current system but coming around ranked choice dark horse way get things accomplished 
and attacked pete campaign https www politico com news elizabeth warren pete buttigieg hostilities klobuchar warren cnn videos tv lead jeff zeleny dnt live jake tapper biden yet coalesced around well including sanders dumb shit everyone except maybe steyer wanted shake candidates hands unfortunately form politics via quick ads debate stage designed sound bites result the way distinguish attack single candidate guilty recall chummy early race gradually heated both played game like while doubt there's sexism play look smooth young mayor small city vs senator think far fetched say main driving force rather system promote types party infighting ranked choice primaries would put progressives much better position decrease intra attacks but moderates establishment dnc first part see happen 
yes something changed flip switch that come making necessary structural changes allows people lives generally better 
every candidate attacked every dumb shit the racism that's play imo way deeper it's systemically ingrained culture while easy look warren's experience clinton's matter indication overt sexism think worth noting well mere fact legit candidates suggests things least changing better it may slower we'd prefer indeed pinning weak 
biden would also near last place still 
the nevada caucus uses rcv early vote ballot cycle constituted almost half votes remember correctly case might well make primary you're right method used states it removes concerns regarding electability first choice eliminated go second no wasted 
familiar early voting nevada caucus worked making ranked list alone specific type system caucuses general garbage poop when constructing think voters express preferences like via one person vote head grid etc compile votes expressions order determine winner take look wikipedia articles choice condorcet criterion schulze method really interesting since actually many different methods determining given set fundamentally perfect method cases none case knowing 
difference handing delegates proportionally instead one winner it let rank choices youre candidate went could pass vote viable remaining candidates would split this bad idea primary going state take say presidential ranked choice criteria passed someone else isnt didnt hit rather last standing 
just clarify rcv probably helped warren much in iowa pete bernie beat able get second preferences candidates worse same thing states finishing th really high enough benefit it would mean people voting strategically go still australia also single transferable senate allows parties spread evenly geographically say basically vote party multiple winners so republicans got democrats libertarians republican senators libertarian means getting large percentage favoured thousand swing voters percent number seats state conservative green senator results time even third house reps step result something representative and yeah compulsory great encourages whoever power make easy painless possible want bad mood forced hour waits tuesday unthinkable we end right wing nutters least surprised countries 
that irv system would pretty bad it argued worse push implement ranked choice voting leaving bit longer right one 
doing mine spreading idea people frustrated primary online 
not star schulze ranked pairs 
want good ranked choice voting system progressivism win results outcomes accurately reflect voter preferences 
tbh candidate want implement establishment cutoff progressives suffer 
isn candidate talked remember anyone else bringing 
think everyone vote day crucial stipulation limits amount fundraising eventual candidate would if implemented good form ranked choice voting emphasis accompanied complementary change compile votes choose winner delegates need thing system able run results essentially built first place get away primaries separate days 
there many different forms ranked choice voting the caucuses addition terrible reasons use really bad form 
yes important remember good reason wanting ranked choice it accurately represents voter preferences may result frequently personally want 
you distraught well with horseshit last days bernie slim odds winning 
schulze method probably would done something like yang warren booker bernie pete klobuchar biden edit godsdammit reddit messing formatting you clearly friendly 
elizabethwarren allow direct linking external subreddits without use np please http reddit com subreddit delete resubmit corrected link edit submission message moderators approve bot action performed automatically contact compose questions concerns 
you absolutely right specified good form ranked choice voting accurately probes compiles voter preferences replied lot comments explaining meant would partial schulze method focused finding best winner rather ranking order everyone pairs at least want fulfills smith criterion ranked requires complex ballot iirc could cause major issues general population dumb 
it like explosion talking the big problem lot people understand many intricacies mean ranked choice voting make start implementing bad forms irv systems maine new york city implemented 
yeah ranked choice voting broad family systems there many different types election like schulze method pairwise comparison two condorcet smith complete methods people tend constructable perfect system though 
it confusing simple enough anyone reasonably able vote understand fine 
that large part yang pushing he best ideas anyone it real shame shut 
sure schulze ranked pairs methods would much better 
can guys give us one day mourn just 
but already following much would different proper voting system you use come meaningful conclusions 
ranked choice voting allows people participate done mail ballot it require lose whole day work wait long hours vote early paper trail also maintaining power candidate drops election what see caucuses overrides participation convenience accuracy 
would prefer voters power directly rather delegates convention 
agree point threshold understand purpose really lowered larger field perhaps sure anyone could defend happened thresholds also electoral college 
said post comment least tried say lol 
personally find way people treat presidential candidates win really awful people act like embarrassing thing world get position st what got voters want president united states shameful hell think nd anything 
well he's giving simplistic view things sake explanation the math behind simple i'm guessing would think take white tiger's votes see percentage second place candidate then extra allocate did also solve problem expressing your way party vote might work well 
true even stv major improvement still worth fighting imo 
what wrong stv implementation standpoint are saying countries counties cities use ranked choice worse first past post representation selection and taking extra time warren voters voted bernie biden desperately want one binary instead voting at point made assertion data back i'm surprised since also op seemed championing idea 
as australian sadly mistaken push good type being condorcet perfect overrated precisely requires compromise bunch things in standard irv situations problems come strongly tend quite odd the alternatives people commonly pushing like approval voting schulze giving candidates rating vulnerable strategic hyperpartisanship extremely difficult count stuff maine system benefit able easily calculated hand voters follow works really important easy stir paranoia rcv actually hardly better crap absurd it pretty much fixes third party support problem someone watched fail around world anti one criteria spreading fear uncertainty doubt current method getting implemented you want transitioning computer either due security concerns would ease counting schulze method fine since possible permutations recorded exponentially increases complexity rate starts get overwhelming increase chances volunteer mistakes again may say we'll take time think irresponsible adding but tell lived complex elements process happens numbers election night simple lack faith sinks rise hell establishment powerbroker determined sink ensure race filled lots know kind 
is possible bernie supporter see comment mentions people attacking others without engaging disingenuous whataboutism pretending campaigns even remotely big problem toxicity feel like may impossible start twitching uncontrollably able sleep week you go crazy knowing saw someone point guy support lot shithead followers trying downplay issue how recognized pisses almost much the fact tried create internet bubbles drown criticism movement allow positive news exist led convincing real life instead done piss anyone pro pushed leave spaces instead playing along undoubtedly want warren supporters attacked often disgusting ways time attacks ask boost well campaign toxic vicious say and know case despite engage dismissing legitimate grievances really reinforces idea entitled refuse allay concerns this strategy arguing none criticisms bad one would hard believe actually helped convince handful on hand definitely if goal try infallible ahead stick but get candidate back suggest listening help comfortable joining 
and yet americans able vote black man president could bring elect woman pinning sexism see every day means i'm weak 
think everyone would appreciate guys leave us alone one day 
that bad ranked choice system the schulze method example works differently much better 
met future president warren last night des moines watch party 
and best night life warren corner since whole wells fargo issue have announced running president proudly caucused last sitting couch pm watching give speech cnn hit need to go see her it minute drive house got right end interviewed washington examiner time associated press made way elizabeth squealed name big hug multiple photos thing playing get home midnight sleep high she exactly see surprises meeting person now come on iowa caucus give us the numbers

but that's record approval rating its high trump lower every president's peak pathetically low honest peak obama bush clinton hw regan nixon johnson kennedy eisenhower truman fdr generally taken source nice handy chart ya https en wikipedia org wiki united states presidential your boy embarrassing way us president

warren becomes fastest first time presidential candidate hit million donations 
make measly donation every paycheck lol 
that's amazing in talking race people mention enough impossibly hard run crowded field two candidates front runners jump it's surprising like booker harris others never really got foot door voters limited bandwidth and meanwhile last three months also billionaires outspending hundred times stuck dc impeachment foregoing big dollar donors crazy achievement what campaign you credit mayor pete rising name id contender he certain advantages including fundraisers done context began impressive anyway team warren 
go liz made two contributions lately want call dammit 
it feels incredibly powerful able say contributed 
bernie supporter just want say congratulations ya'll go team progressive go 
soon fastest president get million donations 
she deserves just made contribution 
that pretty amazing definitely gives grassroots cred brag 
why thread downvoted like hurt success 
woo hoo keep guys feel discouraged noise focus goal 
and without selling big money fundraisers 
nice progressives killing cycle hope new fundraising method people directly sticks 
overview fec data analysis https drive google com open id ky kkiltibxpi qdygmlbvlqrm 
this feels like cherry picked stat 
believe warren launched campaign feb th while bernie april that difference months weeks she probably earliest point campaigning history given earlier launch fastest 
same wife donate little bit month warren bernie 
i've listening 's podcast primary system thought way worked mess learned agree idea closed selection then also europe explaining things time folks like bonkers yep 
ask bernie ran entire democratic party she could back made extra difficult running especially support gained since not mention biden jumping well care much billionaires though 
sick flair go team progressive 
sorry pedantic even becomes president can't assumed figure would accurate 
good idea maybe get million super tuesday 
think pretty obvious quite pathetic 
but important it means sanders ran first time get fast 
very sensitive cherry picked stat first hispanic american male ever graduate gpa drive red honda comment post 
and feels like trolling comment reported edit user's post history suggests warren including belonging pro trump sub dealt endless brigading abuse see reason tolerate negativity towards campaign seem coming genuine position 
he run president warren hasnt in took days longer get million it great achievement either way celebrate 
you're getting downvoted read headline 
yea consider really running president think he's def cut built something despite lack name id ways people awesome 
yes difficult which achievement great and quite frankly people happy running happened we looking 
oh know it ridiculous watching happen 
jeez actually reported comment the hell matter 
the title pretty self explanatory points made 
think initially given far come definitely serious contender point time 
sanders supporter upvoted like see progressives energizing people 
you think negative comment pro trump redditor might trolling edit post history includes sub support yang forgive trust intentions 
think around st debate shifted gears bit started thinking could actually win the funny part least likeable persuasive window though he's always guy but subsequently running like principle candidate automation ubi engaging non voters talking community issues usually get mentioned stage cheerleading candidates if there's things he'd done differently last four months 
think ubi potentially great super interesting panacea yang similarly automation super nightmare but like lot warren reading book doubt sponge stuff genuinely curious passionate policy economic legal genius one reasons best candidate miles two term senator ever elected president first true jfk top head in words would first senator even massachusetts and i'd bet alone second relevant xkcd https xkcd com 
removed per rule please proselytize candidates we're happy talk similar plans proposals actively campaigning someone else point sub 
this weird thing say considering job like years that's would consider career behind times struck point really know ropes 
hey thanks awesome so exciting two amazing progressive candidates kicking ass race 
can reel friends please we're tired 
yang pretty awesome not favorite candidate like guy also trump sub if democrats mentality republicans going win elections just preaching choir get votes you gonna try convince people otherwise maybe open progressive ideas racists corrupt billionaires 
go ahead find pro trump comments commenting subs trump support the irony called trolling reported also even comment redditer matter attack ideas person this sports 
think achieved good portion goal ubi discussed national debate people talking that great achievement 
sanders supporter unfortunately easy one bad actor destructive manipulative online especially buy bot reddit accounts on texting slack someone impersonating staff member answering questions erroneously throw voter records this kind manipulation happening anyone challenging status quo let's stay strong together 
it yang bad people support warren coming badmouth supporters 
yea agree he's way succesfull even anticipated remember interviews like yea i'm running president sheepishly pitch ubi automation come long done well think assuming anything silly henceforth extent win trump impacted presence primary dems better position ran 
removed rule don't come warren's sub talk favorite candidate say could vp 
let's stay strong together hell yeah lfg 
that comment said cherry picked stat bad mouthing again take statistic going trump vicious attacks general 
guess or media ploy pit progressive candidates successful here's hoping former 
is sub strictly warren i'm frankly surprised commentary still hours 
it's warren strictly dems even non engage want folks coming proselytize candidates either this the donald we cogent analysis constructive feedback long go that's candidate better come donate phonebank vote etc 
understand want warren supporters strong savvy possible democrats hell general considered one point however common cause nominee matter wins primary
