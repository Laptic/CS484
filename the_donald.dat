/r/hillaryclinton is basically shut down. fucking hilarious. i think every post is locked.
We literally shit posted him to the White House.
#IT'S OFFICIAL, FOLKS.

#IT'S ACTUALLY FUCKING OFFICIAL!!!

*HIGH ENERGY EDIT:*

First off, I want to say that I love all of you. 

We took so many hits. From the bull shit liberal media, to even fucking Reddit censoring the truth from us.
#WE HAD ALL THE ODDS AGAINST US.

But guess what?

#WE FUCKING WON.

**FUCK [redacted]**, and FUCK all of those that doubted us. I'm sure we can all recount the hundreds--if not thousands--of people who called us idiots, racists, misogynists, or whatever else. They are all eating their words now, and it has never been more glorious, my friends.

I also would like to say **RIP Justice Scalia**. You are truly a legend to the highest Court. May his legacy now live on for generations.

Lastly, I am so proud to say **CONGRATULATIONS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP!!**

#MAKE. AMERICA. GREAT. AGAIN. 
#LOVE YOU ALL PEDES, WE DID IT!#
suh do you really hate me (martin shkreli) and have seriously studied my issue or was your reaction just a quick take? i'm a big fan either way. GO TRUMP.

Mr. Trump, you've been on record saying the "war on drugs" has failed.   The "war on drugs" has cost the US hundreds of billons of dollars over decades. Building the wall is one way to stop the crossing of hard drugs into our country, but as some states have shown legalizing marijuana or medical marijuana has lead to tax and tourism revenue. Under a Trump administration, what will the federal stance be on recreational marijuana/medical marijuana and is there any possibility of legalization for much-needed revenue?
Mr. Trump

What is your plan for reducing or removing the influence of money on politics?

Mr. Trump, what do you feel is the greatest issue facing young Americans today?
The pictures of Americans landing on the moon is one of the most widely knows photos in the world. It shows American strength, power, and achievement. 

 Will you give NASA a bigger budget and allow them to to make even greater achievements, like going to Mars or building a moon base?
Strange that this AMA isn't on r/all...
Mr. Trump,

Reports estimate that 90% of US media is owned by 6 companies. The US mass media has fused into a gross alliance with big business and big government as this election has shown more than any other.
The dishonest media is rigging our democracy with a radical agenda that divides Americans and causes nothing but sensationalism and hatred at the expense of the USA. They are killing our country for ratings and profit, with impunity.

How will you, as president, tackle this protected class of media elites without stepping on the first amendment rights of average Americans?
Can anyone eli5 with this vote fuzzing and why we have 10k and 16k uptendies on our threads?
We are going to lose our minds once we get real pics of him in the oval office
Upvote everything!
fuck the front page of reddit. DONALD J. TRUMP IS GOING TO BE ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WORLD. 
I'm not sure about that.  The_donald isn't in the top 200 on my front page.  I had to come here to figure out what's going on.  Definitely some censorship going on.  AGAIN, this is my home page not r/all.

Edit: I came back 2 hours later and checked again.  I stopped looking after I found not one the_donald post in my top 700 on my home page.

2nd Edit:  On r/all there's one T_D post at #2. But if logged out and go with incognito mode the #2 post disappears all together and T_D no more.

The points are increasing on all posts so it's hard to tell, but our points have been cut in half compared to other subs.
Him looks so big like a president of small town. 
I just saw this on all, good job guys!! 
Ok, unrelated, but some leftist cuck (not naming names) keeps calling me a conspiracy nut and is constantly making fun of my family's health, and he's lying, as per usual of their agenda. I've reported him for taking jabs at my family, but how do I deal with people like him? What do I say?
