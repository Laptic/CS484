Ironically, this is creating more exposure than the original statement ever would have had
> Blizzard’s actions inspired a negative reaction among lawmakers, who denounced the gaming giant. On Twitter, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said the company was willing to “humiliate itself” to please China. Marco Rubio declared that “Implications of this will be felt long after everyone in U.S. politics today is gone.”

When you have Wyden and Rubio in agreement that you fucked up, you REALLY fucked up.
If everybody had phones, we wouldn't be in this situation. /Blizzard
So who else, is going to Blizzcon cosplaying Winnie the Pooh?

Let's try and keep the comments here civil. You don't have to like Kobe, but celebrating his death, making jokes about it, and wishing death/threatening other people still violates our rules. 

Users who threaten other people will be banned on sight.
Leaving your house and returning safely is such an underrated blessing.
Not too long ago he was pictured alongside his daughter at a basketball game and they seemed so close. She also died today. Rest in peace Kobe and Gianna.

Okay guys I keep getting some pretty fucked up messages in my inbox. If you have a problem, especially if it was because he was black, please swallow your cowardice and post it here so you can get the ridicule you deserve.
12:35 PM PT -- Kobe's daughter Gianna Maria -- aka GiGi -- was also on board the helicopter and died in the crash ... reps for Kobe tell TMZ Sports. She was 13. 
We're told they were on their way to the Mamba Academy for a basketball practice when the crash occurred. The Academy is in nearby Thousand Oaks.
TMZ reporting Kobe's 13 year old daughter also killed in crash.

Favorite Hawking anecdote, from [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/mar/14/stephen-hawking-professor-dies-aged-76):

>He began to use crutches in the 1960s, but long fought the use of a wheelchair. When he finally relented, he became notorious for his wild driving along the streets of Cambridge, not to mention the intentional running over of students’ toes and the occasional spin on the dance floor at college parties.
I wonder if any time travelers will come to his funeral.

Will always remember him from this from my childhood

I did tech support for security and alarm systems for over 400 locations with six to eight cameras and sensors each for about a year. 90% of calls were just trying to explain to someone how to review recorded footage. The most common "malfunction" was when people leaving the location.. would flip the breakers and shut off power to the entire site. I think maybe once or twice did I have to send a tech out to service a camera. As a high estimate, that's like 0.08% failure rate. With people who don't even understand security or tech or can't figure out how to operate a simple remote.

These things are designed to run 24/7 for years without problems. The chances of specific cameras failing or footage being unusable around a specific time during a specific, high-profile event at a prison that has minute-to-minute experience and heavily relies on these systems is so astronomically low that I'd call it the worst cover-up in the history of murder. And that's before the fact that during this specific instance of all this failure, two guards didn't make their rounds for unknown reasons but only the rounds that pass by this specific location.

I worked in the security Industry for years and a lot of that time was in a monitoring control room,

It was a somewhat rare occurrence for individual cameras to malfunction and most of the times that they did was from human interference,

Suicide by homicidal strangulation. Nasty way to go.
I doubt he cares, but I specifically told my congressman John Ratcliffe that if he doesnt make a notable effort to stop this I'm donating a large sum of my personal money to whoever runs against him. He doesn't have a lot of campaign money so it'll go a long way

Edit: somebody asked if they could copy/paste this to social media. Feel free. You don't need to ask permission to copy/paste a Reddit comment lol. *At least not while we have net neutrality...* 

On 2nd thought, please pay me $1.99 to copy/paste this comment to any *1* social media site. Only $0.49 to add an additional site! 


One of the most impressive achievements of human technology in recorded history is about to be put in a stranglehold by the same dirtbags who bundle infomercial channels in place of real content on TV that you pay for (Looking at you, DirecTV), and then want to charge extra to include channels that people will actually watch.  Just imagine what they are going to try to do to the internet if they get away with this.  
Since apparently the way we govern now is "fuck what the last guy did," what's to prevent the next administration from just reimplementing net neutrality?
We need you to *act* not criticize or sigh and act like it's inevitable.

This is the one time I highly recommend you contact the Trump Whitehouse directly.

* Comments: 202-456-1111
* Email: HTTPS://www.whitehouse.gov/contact

* Or just tweet at him. He'll see how unpopular it is and change his mind. I guarantee it. 

* Someone below has said another number to try is 202-418-1000 this is the FCC chairman's line.

EDIT: if you all are calling as fast as you're replying we are going to make a statement!

Here is a script from, ahem, u/poop_standing_up my autocorrect is forever tainted...

Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.

Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. 

Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all.
