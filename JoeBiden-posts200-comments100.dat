Hervis Rogers was the last person in line to vote in Texas after waiting for over 6 hours in line and voting at 1 am. His vote? Joe Biden.

What a great American!
I don’t even care who he voted for. That is a true American, but should also never be something an American has to endure just to exercise ones right to vote.
I hope Joe Biden sends him an autographed t-shirt.
read a comment earlier on r/politics saying "it doesn't matter who he voted for, he's a hero." It all makes sense now.
Some one by him a pizza...but this is insulting ...that ppl have to wait 6 hours for their demcratic night. Fucking gop
I don’t know why, but this brings tears to my eyes.
Why are the lines so long? They need a better voting system. I’ve voted in PA , Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin( yes I tend to live in the swing states)and never waited more than 10 minutes.
We need to protect him from the Bernie bros
HERVIS  HERVIS  HERVIS  If he runs for something next time, I'll contribute.  I hope it's TX Secretary of State.
I saw supporters of a certain senator acting like this man was a martyr for their campaign.
The Bernie sub was sharing photos of this guy today and automatically assuming he waited all that time to voted Bernie and I'm just like.......well this is awkward.....
*BuT tHe PeOpLe BeHiNd HiM wErE vOtInG fOr BeRnIe*  More seriously, I think it’s pretty fucking telling how someone feels about this election – the primary and the general – that they stood that long in line to vote. The dude was late for work when he left the line at 1am, and went in to finish his shift regardless.  Pretty fucking impressive, considering how many people are voting for Biden not because he *excites* them, but because they believe he’s a good person and many of the alternatives don’t impress them or actively scare them.
God bless this man.
Fucking hero  Also fuck the GOP voter suppression
No voter should EVER have to wait 6 hours to vote. This man is an astounding citizen for his patience and persistence, but this is an issue that must be addressed as soon as we take the White House. A 6 hour wait to vote is without a doubt a voter suppression tactic. Let's go fix our democratic system.
But there’s no enthusiasm for Joe!
You are looking at the MAJORITY not a minority.
Real life hero ❤️
Fucking epic. What a patriot!
It is an eternal disgrace that this country had made voting, the cornerstone of our democracy, so difficult to do.
Doesn't get any realer than a black man voting for Biden at TSU. That's Third Ward, baby.
The voting system in this country is an absolute disgrace. Electronic ballots shouldn’t be a thing. Lines shouldn’t be a thing. POLLING STATION CLOSINGS SHOULDN’T BE A THING.
I sent a note to my state Biden campaign deputy director about Mr H Rogers, suggesting an autographed photo of Diamond Joe as a token of thanks.  Perhaps others can make similar suggestions.
This is beautiful. Thank you for staying in line sir.  Voter suppression is a scourge.
what a patriot
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎💎♥️♥️♥️♥️
THANK YOU...
Do you have a source for who he voted for?
This is an outrage. For every incredible, persevering guy like this there were probably thousands more who had no choice but to turn home because of kids, work, etc.  This is what happens when we don't vote Democrat. Whatever your preferred candidate if it wasn't Joe, you'll never see them elected if we keep tearing each other apart and letting Republicans into office so they can suppress the vote.  No one should have to sacrifice their time and energy like this just to exercise their basic human rights. It makes my fucking blood boil.
Jesus Christ, that is some serious dedication.  Hopefully he brought something to entertain himself.  I have never had to wait that long for anything and that includes both fun things like at Disneyland and also necessary things like the DMV.  Way to go Hervis.  Texas and the country needed you.
People should never have to wait in line 6 hours to vote.
Mr Hervis Rogers I am so glad you waited !! and did not let the names of those who died and battled for the right to vote be forgotten!! You persisted and did not let those MF’s take away your right to vote!! so damn proud of you !! you are a patriot!! I know a few people that would have left the scene, but you sir did not!! Much respect!!
Hervis Rogers for VP.
The dnc is rigging it against us now?😂
Hervis is an American hero!
BLESS HIS BEAUTIFUL SOUL!
Legend.
But but but nobody's excited to vote for Biden.........
The face of a man who respects how important voting and the right to vote is.
Fucking patriot. Biden need to give him a call.
This man is a true American.
This is so fucked up. But good on him for staying!
What is Joe Biden’s to tackle voter suppression ?
Hervais, we at Joe Biden sub and all of America THANK you!!!
He’s an amazing American citizen who a lot of young people bitching about Sanders’ losses should pay attention to; however, what kind of fucked up system are we running where it takes 6 hours to vote?!
what's the source on him voting for Joe?
This is good that this kind of thing is getting attention so it can hopefully get fixed, [but still.](https://i.imgur.com/qrOhBYT.png)
Hervis is a real one
Respect to this man
Thank you to this hero
This guy deserves a medal.
I don't even like Biden but this man should get everyone's (up)vote.
Hero
Mr. Rodgers indeed!
God. Where I live there are rarely lines longer than like 1 minute.
How can it take so long?
But I was told the DNC rigged it against Bernie by having long lines and wait times
True fucking patriot right there!
I’m glad he voted!! I’m genuinely confused as I am new to voting and I was able to do it by mail... why doesn’t everyone do it by mail?? Do certain states not allow voting by mail??
I hope we do right by Harvis and fix these lines before election day. Harris county has some work to do.
What a hero!

But y’all , isn’t he not coherent anymore + against the people
He knows the thing
Chances of a white person waiting for 6 hours to vote in Texas: 0%. Representative democracy is liberal bs apparently.   Says something when the only way to stay in power is stopping people from voting.
We are screwed.
This isn’t the guy that ended up being a felon is it?
[removed]
Literally, it is the Hervis Rogers of the world that make America great!  We should all remember how many people have given their lives so that we get to vote.  Let's make sure to get Joe across the line in November so that our democracy can stand.
 This is the face of voter suppression.
I think it bears mentioning though. I see a lot of Sanders supporters floating conspiracies about the rigged system, but Texas's suppression was know to disproportionately effect POC who have shown strong support for Biden.
It's malarkey no matter who he voted for, but the fact is that we need to shut down the conspiracy mongers claiming this was some sort of Biden-led ploy
I was thinking the same thing.
i hope joe has him sit at the state of the union to show the effects of voter suppression.
I hope joe brong him on stage in mi and say vote for who you want but like thus man did
He should campaign with him.
Rule of thumb on r/politics: "It doesn't matter who I/they vote for" = "I'm a Biden supporter but could you not downvote me for once?"
Oh, If he’d voted Bernie, they would have absolutely let you know.
I like this idea, or any other gift 🙂
No way, take this man out for a damn steak, medium rare.
Exactly, Fuck the GOP and REMEMBER THIS IN NOVEMBER!
Ginsburg's Umbrella. :(
In MA I walked in and out in 1 minute.. No line at all.
I say we all somehow chip in and buy him ALL THE MERCH
Me too
[It's no accident.](https://www.salon.com/2020/03/03/voter-suppression-plain-and-simple-texas-closed-hundreds-of-polling-sites-in-black-latino-areas/)    > Texas has closed 750 polling locations since 2012... the overwhelming majority of closures came in areas that saw the largest increase in black and Latino residents.  I live in a conservative area of rural Ohio and have always voted quickly and easily.  I have a feeling it would not be so quick and easy in the black neighborhood 10 miles away.
Took me and my husband about 15 minutes. Not everywhere is like this in Texas.
> Why are the lines so long?   Because the GOP runs the state government
Too late. Circulated photo hours ago saying he is low information dude 'voting against his own interests' ... *Sigh*
I'm sure there were plenty of Sanders voters who waited almost as long as well. It's a damned shame anyone has to deal with this.
I'm sure Bernie supporters dealt with some malarkey too, what's annoying is Bernie supporters trying to make it seem like some conspiracy on Biden's part based on no evidence and against all logic
That’s more true than the Bernie bros realize. There was no one behind this guy, and no one was voting for Bernie!
This is my takeaway too. He's not a hero; he's a victim who persisted. Instead only applauding him, we must decry this travesty of democracy.
Absolutely. He is without a doubt an amazing citizen, but this is “inspiring” in the same sense that calling a bake sale a kid organizes for his dying mom who doesn’t have health insurance “heartwarming.” It should definitely inspire us all to action! Please vote down ballot, vote local, vote hyperlocal! 💎☕️👍🏼
My thoughts exactly
Can’t find any source stating that he actually voted for Biden, so I call bs, but if someone can prove me wrong please do.
Fun fact ”the third way” was what they called fascism in the thirties. just a fun ’lil fact.
Joe Biden: I don't care who you're supporting, attacks like this against a man who could be the first Jewish President are disgusting and beyond the pale. Hatred and bigotry have no place in America — and it's up to all of us to root out these evils wherever they're found.
**We do not tolerate racism or bigotry.** Though it thankfully hasn't been a problem here, if you see anything, message us mods.
Classy. Reminds me of Pete stepping up in one of the debates to defend Biden from the Republican smear against his family. Have to remember that while it's a competition, we're all on the same side and working toward the same goal.
I’m not a huge Biden fan (hello from r/all/rising), but I really appreciate the approach y’all take to stuff like this. After four years of expecting the worst from Trump supporters, it’s a breath of fresh air to see this instead.
The only Bernie criticisms we should see on here or elsewhere that Team Joe’s presence goes should be real, tangible, and tasteful criticisms. I have plenty. Civil discussion to educate and inform prospective voters is the only road we should take here.  As Ed Koch once said, “If you agree with me on 9/12 issues, vote for me. If you agree with me on 12/12 issues, see a psychiatrist.”
Classy.
That is a disgusting thing to do. I’m so angry right now. So many of our great grandparents or grandparents fought and died over this and so many edgy idiots go around roleplaying like it’s no big deal. I need to go sit down and relax now.
It’s awesome how he acknowledges that Bernie could be the first Jewish president, rather than just referring to him as “my opponent” this is the humility that drives his appeal, for me at least
Joe's a good man.
this is leadership
Thanks Joe for calling this out quickly and completely.
Thank you Joe!
I really appreciate the show of decency. Will be nice to have a president that does that. I didn't realize how much we all took it for granted in past presidencies.
There are enough valid things to criticize Sanders on. There is absolutely NO ROOM for any kind of vile bigotry or slander. There's been far too much of it against all candidates in this race and it's beyond petty.
💎
Thank you for fighting for kindness, Joe!
THANK YOU JOE! VERY COOL!
Thanks from a Bernie supporter
Joe has always been a great guy.
*My president.*
Now this is what a leader does. Denounces poor behavior in supporters. Let us live up to biden's expectations here. There is no need to attack Bernie. Punching down is beneith everyone here.
I’d like to see this sub adopt same approach. By ceasing negative posts about Sanders. We didn’t have negative posts about him before. We just all focused on what we are FOR. Let’s take a cue from Joe’s message here.
If Sanders was running against Trump, Trump would probably make fun about what happened at the rally. Bernie is a good person. I don't agree with all of his politics, but he did NOT deserve that flag at his rally. I like how Biden is backing Sanders. That just shows how good a man Biden is.
Amazing that Diamond tweets something like this 30 mins ago, and 5 mins ago Sanders is attacking his campaign again. They are honestly so negative. Wild.
Those Twitter replies. Wtf is wrong with people.
This is a true leader. Working to unite people, even his opponents under one roof. He won't take advantage of evils against his opponent for his own gain but will denounce them. This should be the norm but it isn't. I'm proud of the man who will be the blue leader
Thank Joe for calling it out.
Bernie is Jewish? I thought he was an Independent.
Imagine Trump ever saying something like this? He wouldn't, and if the press pushed him on it he'd say "there's good people on both sided".
Clearly a Trump supporter.

>As Ed Koch once said, “If you agree with me on 9/12 issues, vote for me. If you agree with me on 12/12 issues, see a psychiatrist.”  Haha I love that line. Absolutely. I don't agree with Biden on everything, nor did I agree with Pete on everything. Enough of my values lined up with Pete's to support him, and the same goes for Biden. We need to stop acting like sports fans for their favorite team. It's okay to criticize even our own supported candidates and realize that no one is going to get it all right. Instead, call out actual problems and leave the vileness to twitter trolls.
Dems win when we stay positive. MAKE AMERICA HOPE AGAIN
And if you put up posters saying “Vote for Cuomo, not the homo”, then you’re a jerk who’s now Governor of New York. They chose not to hit Koch on being Jewish, though.
Damn it! I'm a Bernie supporter but that was convincing lmao. Y'all and y'all civil discourse are something to strive for 👏🏼👏🏼
ITA this is the leadership we need for our country. Joe Biden is the man to do it. Racism has no place in the White House. It’s not going to happen overnight but I truly believe that big changes will be made.
As a Jewish American, I would like to thank you for standing up against bigotry. An act of bigotry against one American is an attack against all Americans. Criticizing Sanders for his Jewish heritage is absolutely disgusting. As you pointed out, there are many valid things to criticize Sanders for.
We are having some dissent in the primary. But let these things not distract us from the common goal:  TO MAKE DONALD TRUMP A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT!
Of course! This isn't about politics. It's about human decency.
This is why he wins
[deleted]
Were these people even Joe supporters? There was a MAGA protest at the same rally so I assumed it was some people from that group
This this this this   We’re not front runners from slinging mud. We’re front runners from taking the high road
Rules of the Road!
We are actively working on it.  And you all can help.  If you see something that isn't the the same vein as what Joe Biden would do or say on the campaign trail then use the report function and downvote.
We do not tolerate racism or bigotry and remove any unfair criticisms along with anything that steps over the line. However, respectful criticism is legitimate. Truth is required for democracy to survive and reality isn't strictly positive.
The vast majority of what i see here that is critical about him is solely hitting him on policy and the segment of his base that are super toxic to others online, dont think ive seen any directly personal attacks on him at al here.
I'm with you.   I sent this to the mods a week ago:   >In joining this sub to have healthy conversation (which has been mostly wonderful, by the way) I can't help but notice a constant trend of low effort posts that always end up being effectively: "Why are Bernie supporters terrible people?"  >I know this going to sound disingenuous, but hear me out: What do these posts actually aim to do? What answer or conversation are you going to hope to get from an opposing candidate's subreddit? The most recent one comes from a seven day old account that has only discussed politics, and like it's many companion threads it's just shot after shot of attacking Sanders supporters.  >I understand that many of these experiences can be authentic, and disallowing the posts won't stop CTH kids from being dicks in r politics or other subs... but if the rhetoric of "All Sanders supporters suck" continues at the frequency today *and* Biden wins the nomination then I'm worried for the effects those generalizations may have for the national election.  >Look how many Pete supporters came to Biden citing those same, broad attacks. I don't want that to happen in the general for Biden and it would be best to get ahead of it early.  >Please give it a thought. Whether it's Biden or Bernie I don't want Trump for another 4 years.  For transparency I also sent this to the Sanders mods:  >I get it, really I do. It's exciting to have so much momentum and it's a rough feeling to no longer have the clear path to the nomination we had. We now have a fight on our hands. A fight for the future we believe in. One where healthcare is a human right, pursuing higher education is something the government actively encourages instead of allowing capitalism from sandbagging every generation out of the gate. One where we listen to science and take real steps towards keeping a healthy world for the future generations.  >As deeply as we want this, we can't tolerate attacking other candidates or their supporters with low effort insults and somehow think that will make this country or the DNC any better. It doesn't. We can't encourage or rely on divisive Trumpisms to rally us against any candidate. It's low hanging fruit that ultimately does nothing but spoil the general election.  >For the last week in the other subs there's been a constant wave of threads, tweets and posts describing anecdotal experiences with the worst of supporters in our camp. Yes, some of these posts are coming from troll accounts but there's also more than enough authentic ones. This behavior is also true of many camps, but S4P has a yuge online presence comparably and so we need to do more or have more collaboration between the subs to ensure we can focus on and discuss policies instead of personal attacks.  >Bernie has made it clear that he condemns those types of supporters and we need to do more to show we embrace that just as much as M4A. We need to report trolls when we see them and check account age and history when you see unusually divisive dialog.  >It would be super nice to see you as the mods coordinate with the other subs mods regarding troll accounts to ensure they are banned here as well. I think a small good faith gesture like that could go a long way.  >One thing for sure is that if we do nothing we ARE going to lose voters to this type of behavior and the rhetoric it fuels and they'll add their own anecdotal threads to the echo chambers. We need unity to not only win the primary but the general election.  >We need to mitigate the poisoning of the well, thank you for reading.
Focus on the positive. Rules of the Road in action.
it's a vicious cycle I saw play out on the Warren sub. Sanders trolls come into the sub constantly. The sub's regular users get more and more angry about that and start directing it to Bernie. The ramped up negative posts about Bernie attract more Bernie supporters. And so on and so on.   I definitely hope this sub doesn't go down that path.
Totally agree. It's easy to criticize/mock those politicians (and their supporters) we disagree with, but better for us all to present what we think is a positive way forward.
I think the approach should be more nuance: We can criticize Sanders and his policies, but stomping down to a new low like being anti-Semitic is an absolute no-no.
People are allowed to make negative posts about Bernie. There is nothing wrong with  criticizing another candidate and their policies. He shouldn't have to deal with attacks over being jewish, but he should definitely not be immune to criticism. It's perfectly valid to criticize him, there's a lot about him and his policies to criticize. Negative posts should definitely be allowed. Biden supporters can't be so afraid of conflict that they let themselves get walked over.
[removed]
I'm a Sanders supporter but have been considering Biden lately. I would be fine with either one. Lately that sub has just been slamming Biden. The campaign has been showing desperation. I don't remember seeing anything about Joe's statement over there.
When someone tells you who they are, believe them.
They are running against each other. Both have said a lot of nice things about each other and have also said a lot of critical things about each other.
Do you think Joe Biden has never criticized an opponent's campaign? This is how elections work.
The “they go low, we vote joe” tweet was gold though
Political Twitter is terrible. It has been for a while and I'm afraid it's getting continually worse.
I’m lesbian, I thought you were American
This is a joke right?   But yes, Bernie is Jewish and actually lost a lot of family in the Holocaust. He is also an Independent politically speaking
What?
>  Easy first one: Joe gets socialized medical care via the government as he is a government official.  Joe isn't a government official, he's currently a private citizen running for office, and government officials aren't on socialized medical care.  You clearly have no clue how the healthcare system works.  Elected officials and people who work in government are on private employer health insurance plans just like everyone else who is employed in this country.
...what?
>This is what Putin and the Republicans want - for Democrat's to be split and attack each other. Seriously - we all have to unite as a party against Trump   -jms515  That's a good attitude to have and I think we should follow it. Let's assume Biden genuinely dislikes racism and anti-semitism and just leave it at that.
Technically everything can be written off as publicity stunt.
All of us have far more in common than our differences, and our differences in culture, heritage, etc should be celebrated, not vilified. Inclusion is one of the things that really drew me to Pete and I am loving the fact that Joe's campaign is also one of drawing people in instead of attacking people.
Sounds like you’re describing Bernie. Sadly, he’ll not even win the nomination.
Yeah, this is definitely something that lines up more with your more nutty MAGA crowd than anything you would see from a true blue democrat. Not that there aren't major problems in certain parts of our party, but you certainly aren't typically going to see people unfurling nazi flags who vote blue.
Pretty sure they were MAGA
Either way it's good to call it out.
I’d like to believe ROTR (coined by another sub) meant anti-Sanders posts were removed. Unfortunately it’s not until this sub absorbed other supporters that I’ve begun to notice these anti-Sanders posts. I’d like to see an end to that.
Thanks I appreciate that and we will do our part.
Things have calmed down a lot in the last few days in this sub. Yep, reality is for sure not always positive. Luckily, for those of us supporting Joe, we have a lot to be thankful for. Onwards and upwards.
Yep. I think we need to let the toxicity of his base go ... and not repeat it here. Policy is fine.
This is an amazing post, I completely agree! Let’s focus on spreading awareness of Joe’s policy plans and how we can convince people to vote blue. We need to unite within our party, now more than ever.
Thanks for caring. Maturity is our goal, not juvenile crap. Joe Biden, and so many other good candidates who now support his nomination, have set the tone. We march on!
Thank you for this post.
Focusing on the positive isn't the same as ignoring everything negative.
ROTR broke down a bit for Pete's sub after we were being gaslit over Iowa over and over and over.
I contributed to some of that negativity post January. Seriously folks. Why can't you just believe a woman or at the very least reserve judgement? Sanders did not apologize, he doubled down. Just like he chose to double down rather than bow up and prop up a younger progressive leader in December.  So much shade can be thrown.
They tried that nonsense multiple times in the Pete sub but our community didn't take the bait and our mods did a fucking fantastic job of stomping it out every time it reared it's ugly head.
This is ridiculous. You need to be able to criticize other candidates. If you disagree with a policy you need to be able to criticize it. Sticking your head in the sand and pretending like every opinion is equally valid and every candidate equally good or bad and like fiction/alt facts is equally valid as actual facts is how we got Trump.  You shouldn't be racist, ableist, sexist or otherwise discriminatory when you criticize but being afraid of pointing out flaws in opposing policies or the behavior of opposing candidates is absolutely NOT the way to do it.

That's politics for you.
I’m a Sanders supporter as well and it is just politics. In a 2-man race going negative is just about the only way to gain ground when you’re down. I think it’s at least a positive/encouraging sign that it seems to only be happening “lately” - I think it’s a testament to Bernie that it seems mostly out of character for him to go negative.
True, but it would've been cool if Bernie at least retweeted this.   From a campaign standpoint I guess it isn't necessarily logical to boost your opponent. When your campaign is characterized by negativity surrounding its online presence though? Maybe a good idea.
It would be nice of Sanders actually had good things about himself to talk about...
You're right Joe Biden criticizes Donald Trump all the time.
Yes, it's a joke.
[removed]
No...in describing Joe... because Bernie as you said won't win the nomination. Joe will, but unfortunately he doesn't have what it takes to beat Trump. Trump's base is too loyal and too hard working.
A lot of his (and Warren and klobacher) supporters were attacked and harassed online for a long time. We are too, of course, but our candidate didn't just drip out. It's an emotional time for them,and they sound be showed time to adjust to things. I felt the sane way after Iowa. They are very good and decent people who just need a cooling off period.   They were naturally passionate about their candidate and got harassed for it. Then when they dropped out the same people calling then rat and snake and everything come around and try to pay nice. They came here mostly angry and disjointed,and fresh off seeing the theocracy of his supporters. The same accounts who we're ridiculing Pete et al were feigning civility. Just give then their time and I know they will go back to their kind and decent selves. I had many conversions with then over policy and electability. It occasionally got hated, but it never got personal. There was always a line. But people can only tolerate so much. I trust our new subscribers. Just give then time.
It's tough. When you log into reddit and see a bunch of false, misleading, and malicious things pushed to the front page by r-Propagandists  We are going to see some ugliness. We can self police but it's hard. But at least the negativity is less focused on character attacks and more reactionary.
The users are the best part!
It's really true. This last week has been so crazy and great, we don't know what to do with our hands! Lol
I really like this Bernie Sanders quote.
That was before Sanders found out that Joe was capable of letting billionaires fund 0.5% of his campaign.
He's never been wrong in 40 years, right?
What’s the source of this quote? I’m curious as I want to stockpile gentle retorts for the Sanders crowd.
I love these kind of retorts because I’m sure the Bernie people have them for us as well.  The reality is that Biden and Bernie are both deeply good men who have been fighting to improve this country and our citizens for their entire lives. We shouldn’t forget that.
Some of the top people on his campaign also had glowing things to say about Biden before he dared to run against Sanders.  David Sirota said that him being chosen as Vice President showed that the progressive wing of the Democratic party had won over the corporate wing.
Joe should put this in ad , just like Sanders put an ad of Obama's kind words of Bernie from years ago
I dig these positive posts!
Look, can we all agree that Joe and Bernie (and Warren and Harris, et. al.) all like each other and are on the same side?  I was equally irritated when Bernie started running the ad with all the praise from Obama.  It’s good that we’re all rowing in the same general direction, and praising one person doesn’t mean you think they’re the best person to be president.  Biden’s [had nice things to say about Bernie, too](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/01/12/the-daily-202-joe-biden-with-praise-for-bernie-sanders-remains-a-2016-wildcard/);  it doesn’t mean he’s a lying hypocrite today when he says why he’d make a better president.
[deleted]
Can Bloomberg make this an ad? Hey Mikey....
I’m pretty sure Bernie has said similar things in 2020. He’s been very clear that he just disagrees with Biden on policy.
Nice to see Biden post for the first time ever, among all the Sanders spam.
Interesting that I'm not hearing much about these kinds of quotes from Bernie's own people.      Ironic.
And then the years went on, and he went through the same consequences of age as our grandparents went through. He's still more sharp than Trump though, so that's good.
Biden should use it in a ad, since Bernie deserves it after taking Obama’s words outta context in his ad.
Can we start a politics thread? “What Bernie really thinks of Joe Biden!” and link the video?
Man what is with the hate here? How about we direct all our sanders hate, and focus it on trump?
Such a nice guy Bernie is. Bernie has also devoted his entire life to working class people, and I prefer Bernie
Bernie used to be a good man, but someone needs to out him down now
[removed]
curious what Biden’s kind words for Bernie were

Q: Let’s try to avoid nuance. Do you support gay marriage?  BIDEN: No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that. That is basically the decision to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it.

This but unironically
Or before he found out about the segregation thing
Interview in 2015 when Biden said he wasn't running in 2016.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=70&v=yiupM-B62Aw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=70&v=yiupM-B62Aw)
Sounds like this Sanders fellow is a pretty decent and reasonable guy
Sanders has always been friendly to Joe, they've worked together a long time, it's just simply that Sanders is a decent dude, I don't see Joe out sledging Bernie either.
So you seem to really not like sanders. Out of curiosity, if he were to win the nomination, how would you vote in the actual election?
All political campaigns are bloodsport.  Especially primaries.  You have multiple people running for the exact same position and you probably agree with 90% or more with the other guy’s policies.  However, if you want to be elected to have to make the other guy’s platform seem radically different, find a random quote from 25 years ago and twist it until he’s saying he hates all black people, and make sure people know he hates his mother and all children for good measure.
Very well put. Regardless of who wins the nomination we need to galvanize as a base against trump. I personally would prefer sanders but obviously Biden has his heart in the right place too.
And they've had plenty of time together as senators. I'd be shocked if there wasn't any shred of camaraderie between them (even if five years in the past with this quote)
Yeah there's clips out there of both Biden and Obama praising Sanders as well on the same virtues.
reasonable take
Bernie still says Biden is a good guy in interviews today. He just says they disagree on policies and that him and Biden have more in common than with Trump.  I want Bernie to win, but damn it if Joe gets the nomination, he better not lose like Hillary did.  Joe Biden is horrible on the debate stage, he will make Trump look like a young man running around him.
Hell yes we can! More than that - we must. We have to stand together as a democratic party. Bernie and Joe are both amazing and they both have same values and similar ideas, they vary on their record in the past, their experience, their plans of implementing policies and , well, the policies themselves, but they are both PROGRESSIVES. As a progressive i refuse to have this term stolen for exclusively Bernie's supporters, i refuse for it to be stripped away from people like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and Joe Biden who had done so much PROGRESSIVE things. We must stand united, NOT smear each other because this is how Trump won in 2016 - he was using Bernie's talking points against Hillary! So please, DO NOT smear any democratic candidate no matter what. Do not give our enemy an advantage. We stand together.   &#x200B;  That being said, i am talking about candidates - when it comes to the supporters, well... I am HEAVILY  disappointed in A CERTAIN FRACTION of Bernie's supporters. I'm not gonna refer to them as Bernie bros or whatever, but it is certain they are toxic, disrespectful and will sink to any level to smear Joe Biden. And some of them are already unable to answer the question "Will you support Joe Biden if Bernie loses the nomination?". That to me is UNTHINKABLE. You dont have to love Joe, but Trump is 180 degrees from progressive values, 180 degrees from progressive agenda, 180 degrees from our common ideology, Bloomberg, YES, even Bloomberg would have been better. Hell, even Bush would be better if he could be reelected because at least he wasn't defending nazis and confederates. To not support the democratic nominee whoever he will be AGAINST TRUMP is to me just unbelievable.
not exactly anti-Sanders here, but Sanders himself wouldn't attack Biden; it's the bandwagoning supporters of Bernie.
Errrr, he's pretty much explicitly said that Biden is serving corporate interests and billionaires at this point.
Unfortunately, sanders has let the whole "rich people and those who look rich are the devil hard stop" get out of control, and now he can't reign it in. A part of his base is going wild and no one can really stop it.
Except he’s doing that thing where he implies he’s in the pocket of billionaires and is corrupt.
Doesn't he say that Biden's old policies gut the middle class though ?
That’s fine. I just hope you support the dem candidate no matter who come November. We have to beat trump.
And how much progress has Bernie actually made for working class people?
stop  just stop brigading I’m a bernie guy myself but you make us look like jackasses
It’s “his turn” because more democrats are voting for him in the primaries. Jesus.
What about when Bernie Sanders said gay marriage shouldn't be a thing?  https://time.com/4089946/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage/
What they said in the past doesn't seem to matter... It was under their administration that it even became legal, and Joe sure supports it now. He has the record in the vice presidency to back that up. People's views evolve. Sorry.
What did he mean by "civil side"? Whats the other side?
Literally no one cares who you vote for. We’re good without you. Go away.
Beautifully said, Bernie.
Just FYI,  this is the PM this asshole sent me.  *"Yeah, go back to Chapo, Mr. Too Pure To Be Smart. Trump & Pence are the same as Obama and Biden? Get the fuck outa here with that bullshit." You are so right I should Go back to where I came from where Chapos dreams of a socialist utopia flourished.... Australia... Ps, I said they were comparable, as in yes you can compare them. You know what I got for that hateful assertion? Banned, so much for free speech hahaha enjoy getting ass fucked by your elected officials for the next 4 years tho*
I’m not sure why or how you’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t like Sanders. I was very into Bernie in 2016, so into him that I voted third party rather than Hillary. I’ve deeply regretted it since.   Four years later, I find myself to be thinking a little more pragmatically and am less enchanted by some of the broad, sweeping policies and promises of Bernie’s. Furthermore, I take concern with the way that his campaign is running. As a former Pete supporter, I saw a lot of mud thrown at a wholesome, pragmatic, and progressive candidate by Sanders supporters over really inconsequential shit.   If Bernie were the nominee I would vote for him in a heartbeat, though I don’t think I would actively campaign for him.
I would vote for Sanders in the general because I'm an adult.   My biggest issue with Bernie is how he attacks other Democrats like Biden or Pete. He doesn't attack them on policy, he attacks the very base of their character, by implying they are corrupt and bought out by billionaires or corporations.  This sort of rhetoric isn't true, but it's also extremely damaging for people who actually believe it, because it turns them off from voting at all in the general election, and makes Trump's victory more likely.
If Biden wins, Bernie supporters need to get behind Biden 110% and vice versa.  I do not feel that a lot of Bernie supporters will do that .   I feel like they are falling into the same trap as they did for Hillary for in 2016.   A lot of Bernie supporters in 2016 did not vote or voted for Trump to send an anti-establishment message.    They cant do that this time
Sanders is already stepping up the attacks.  He’s bringing up things Joe said in the 1970s to make it seem like Joe’s one step away from overturning the gains of the Civil Rights Movement.   The foot soldiers take their queues from the campaign staff.  It’s not like the Bernie Bros are acting completely independently of Bernie’s campaign.
Well yeah that's a disagreement on policy...
There’s definitely some extremist about; as a non extreme but solid Bernie supporter I want to scream ‘Russian bots’ but I know some people are just extreme, and it sucks.
[removed]
That’s the main goal. It’s too bad it’s unlikely that Bernie will win, I really support his values and beliefs. But come election time independent voters and moderates won’t be willing to vote too radical :/
There are at least two post offices with new names, so I’ll say “a ton!”

I came to that conclusion from your comment, obviously I must have misinterpreted it. Also have you seen the problems Pete has had with race? That isn’t important to my original question, but I am curious. Obviously I would like to be as pragmatic as possible, whatever gets trump out of office is what I’ll do. I just want as much change as possible. But not at the risk of losing the election. So I just don’t know at this point man.
That seems like a pretty good argument for Bernie being more electable.
Unfortunately this is the reality of today politics. If you don't smear and attack your opponents you have no chance of winning.
Not really. It's an accusation of bad intent and fundamental political corruption.  I mean he literally says that Biden is serving at the behest of 60 billionaires. That's more than policy.
I don't dislike Bernie...I think he's a decent person. But he's had numerous surrogates launch extremely dirty attacks on Biden...and he's even apologized for Teachout. I've been critical of Biden on the busing issue, even though I do understand at the time the polling in support for busing among Black voters in Delaware barely broke 50% and sometimes had more negative polls. I've had family  members even say they had mixed feelings on it, and they were the ones who would have theoretically had their children benefit from it.   TLDR: It's a complicated issue, even though I think Biden was wrong. But I've seen white surrogates of Bernie call Biden a segregationist like George Wallace based on the busing issue and then scoff at Black voters for voting for him....and it's like "hell nah, it's not even close to being on the same level." I mean, look at Bill de blaiso...did you hear what he said about Black voters and Biden?  Frankly, Biden's surrogates could fire back but they don't (for example, the video of Bernie blaming Obama for only 10% of white Mississippians voting for Democrats was so, so insanely tone deaf or saying guns are different in Chicago than Vermont..yikes).   So I don't get why you are upset at this very, very mild retort that some Biden supporters may use in response to people screaming Biden's corrupt and a segregationist.

You can always vote for down-ballot progressives.
On the contrary. He generates dynamic answers instead of shoehorning questions to fit them into a 39 year old pitch. Combine that with a stutter and yes, you get someone who sounds like a human being in their 70s.
Oh I know, but maybe just maybe, they'll realize that the Sandman himself evolved his positions over time.
He didn't endorse gay marriage openly until 2009
Do you have any more recent pictures that aren’t from the 60s/70s/80s? 🙄
The point is, people change and evolve on the issues. Just as the electorate as a whole has. We should celebrate growth, not demonize it.   https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/us/politics/as-gay-rights-ally-bernie-sanders-wasnt-always-in-vanguard.html   https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-gay-marriage_n_569fcc4de4b0a7026bf9e06f   https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/sanders-has-evolved-same-sex-marriage-too-n454081
Yep federally recognized marriage sure must be a basic human right huh? And besides do you think if he gets into office he'll just start legislating against them?
Yeah, but did you not read the “go away” part?
I did see some backlash about Pete’s lack of support from minorities. I wouldn’t classify them as a problem with race. He’s still a young man, working hard to solve problems and who can’t control everything about his city or what happens in it. Despite his shortcomings as a mayor, I was really sold when he held a town hall after the officer involved shooting and really listened to the people. He didn’t try to deflect or defend himself - he acknowledged that he was partially to blame and was apologetic and genuine.  I personally think that Biden is more likely to accomplish more change because of the coalition of supporters behind him. Meaningful change is only accomplished by holding the house and trying to flip the senate, if Bernie wins a polarizing general election I imagine that the 2022 midterms would not be favorable to democrats in swing districts as a backlash to the general.   Good luck in your decision making process!
No, its a good warning for Bernie supporters to not abstain or vote for Trump for being brainswashed by trolls or Trump rhetoric trying to say Bernie is being treated unfairly to try to divide us
He's not saying that Biden is propped up by a handful of billionaires because he's been bought (although to some extent I think that is what he's implying, which he shouldn't). He's saying that the ultra-wealthy have desires that are anathema to everyone poorer than them. They looked at the field to decide which candidate would best serve their (as in, not our) interests and chose Biden.
I just got done watching bernies Super Tuesday follow up video where he said something to the effect ‘ I think Biden is a very decent guy, I look forward to debating with him about the issues, avoiding personal attacks and focusing on only the issues’ I definitely summarized the last sentence but the first sentence is word for word
I mean if 60 billionaires are helping fund your campaign, aren't you serving them to some extent?
Well I'm not upset, I'm just saying that is a difference in policy. Your points about Biden's perspective on segregation may be valid, but they don't have much to do with Biden and Bernie's difference in policy in regards to supporting the interests of billionaires.
As long as he works in acknowledgment to the people’s consensus he’d be fine, remember this is an election against trump, not ourselves
Well now sanders problem is that he *isnt* changing in order to appeal to moderates. Change and compromise is a positive, not a negative.
[removed]
That's just not true,  In a 1972 letter to a local newspaper — which was recently resurfaced by Chelsea Summers at the New Republic — Sanders wrote that he supported abolishing "all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc.)" as part of his campaign for Vermont governor.   Sanders has carried many of these positions to this day. He was one of the few federal lawmakers to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal ban on same-sex marriages, in the 1990s. And while he told Time's Jay Newton-Small in March that he has no current stance on marijuana legalization (but backs medical marijuana), he characterized the war on drugs as costly and destructive.  In 1983, as mayor of Burlington, he signed a Gay Pride Day proclamation calling it a civil rights issue. He was one of just 67 members in the House of Representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act, a politically tough decision he prides himself on and points to as a key progressive bona fide. Sanders opposed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell in 1993, another President Bill Clinton-era policy, and supported civil unions in Vermont in 2000.
[removed]
His campaign has had almost no money despite that. It doesn't seem like it's anything other than the typical donation that caps at $2800.
That's a different question that I'm happy to get into, but either way that isn't a policy critique.
LOL I replied to the wrong person. Sorry!  But for real..Biden's camp was notoriously broke. He couldn't even campaign in several ST states because he had zero $....he literally had no on air ads until like the day before when some last minute Super PAC cash came in. it's all well and good to say "no billionaires,' but frankly joe doesn't have the network of young voters that Bernie has..he needs to do fundraisers.   And I am not fond of Bloomberg (although I will always give him serious props on gun control)....but I'm desperate to get out Trump. If Bloomberg wants to spend another billion bucks getting Trump out by running non stop ads in FL, AZ, etc. and spearheading voter registration...I welcome it. The RNC has a war chest, and we can't bring a knife to a gun fight. I don't understand why Bernie is refusing that cash...sometimes you do have to compromise.
But Bernie came out of the womb with his 2020 positions fully formed!!! Please don't look at his Immigration and gun control record tho  /s

Are you like this in real life? Like you show up at places where you’re not wanted, shit your pants, and when people tell you to get out because you stink so bad, you go “no?”  That’s no way to live, son.
Fun fact: there are places outside of reddit
Ha talk about a fucking echo chamber   This dude is being educated with memes on Reddit   Damn
We had this in the UK as well.  The Labour Party got destroyed in the General election and a bunch of people couldn't believe it.  The echo chambers are strong and the best place to find people with different ideas is to knock on doors.
Because 15-year-olds and Russian trolls don't vote in US primaries.
omg that is sooooooooooooooooo on brand lmao
Reminder that this is an echo chamber too. Step outside sometimes and see things from other people’s point of view. Or else we’re no better than the people we’re dissing.
> redditor who only visits the most toxic subs on the entire site is surprised to find out he’s miles deep in an echo chamber
Fun fact: r/politics is rigged! They ban people who disagree with Bernie all the time. It is nothing but a stream of far left/anti-moderate/pro-Bernie opinion articles and everything else, including things supporting Warren, gets downvoted to oblivion.
Here is some helpful data.  The problem with the youth vote strategy is there is twice as many 30 to 100 year olds as there are 18 to 30 and they vote twice as much.  So its a 4x advantage.  This idea that a bunch of people showing up in one place is indicative of how the voting will go is really misguided.  80 year olds don't need a rally to get them to vote.   https://www.sos.state.mn.us/election-administration-campaigns/data-maps/historical-voter-turnout-statistics/
Lol one short visit to the Pete sub will tell you that that is utter bs
And that's when the tendies hit the floor.
This is what happens when they downvote and abuse anyone who doesn't agree with them, they then don't get to hear from anyone else.
Someone just discovered what a "bubble" is.
I can’t get news on Reddit.  Nothing but how amazing Bernie is and how everyone else is awful.  That couldn’t possibly be the reality of things.   Something shady going on, obviously.  Or maybe he is perfect and everyone else is truly a sell-out and cares only about billionaires.  The news on here is like a Fox News for Bernie.
This is asking for the tendies copy pasta.
Also when you ban everyone from all of those trying to support other candidates it happens that way.
Especially since a lot of people on Reddit are not America n. Source: I am Canadian.
At this point, it's like NYY and BOS fans arguing.  There's my team and your team.  That's why I like Joe, and why he pisses so many people off. He's not as much of a team. I love Joe, but not obsessively like I liked Obama or people like Bernie.  I actually think that is healthy, and a better way to view a politician.  As a person.
So happy to see Bernie losing, his fans are annoying and Bernie is not going to ever get their lofty plans passed anyways.
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Bernie to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was polling well in North Carolina???? This is so fucked.
This was clearly a joke. Dude posted several other obvious troll comments.  I laughed pretty hard, because it perfectly captures the mentality of your average Sanders voter.
It's like these people never went to school and heard about the Saturday Evening Post predicting a huge Alf Landon landslide vs FDR based on their telephone poll. If course only rich people had phones at the time so this group was not representative of the whole. Same with Reddit. It skews really young and therefore to Bernie.
Bernie supporters are pathetic and they dont even vote.
already saying its rigged and the results aren't even in yet lmao
Reddit is so absurdly left-wing compared to the general population.  And the right-wingers mostly stick to themselves in their quarantined subs.  /r/neoliberal, /r/tuesday, and /r/moderatepolitics have kept me sane here.  Interestingly enough, /r/politicalcompassmemes seems to have a pretty good balance of all types able to meme amongst each other peacefully.
Oh those kids, bless their little hearts!
**rigged** _adj._: a quality of disliking a situation or process
Well yes. The online astroturfing campaign and Cambridge Analytica like outfits funded by dark money are rigging the narrative. They are manufacturing consent.
That or it's because almost anything to do with another candidate gets buried.
Reddit is a hive minded place
[deleted]
Trump had similar upvotes on reddit in 2016. Turns out it was mass bots. Just thinking if same for Bernie. Especially over last month it has gotten worse
Biden voters a sitting by the radio sipping lemonade as they listen to Bing Crosby.
Ugh. "Rigged elections." Where have we heard that before 🙄
That logic seems a bit silly and unfounded...but I gotta say Bernie has a MUCH bigger community supporting him on reddit than Joe does..which is weird considering how well Biden is doing in the primary right now. Perhaps it’s all the young folks that support him vs us boomers who don’t really use reddit to the same degree?
don't forgot to report post like these.
psssssst, there's life outside your apartment. go outside and *talk to people, dude*
Not only that but at least that first one will ban people who say mean things about Bernie.  I don't know about the other candidates.
Supporting anyone but Sanders on reddit gets you treated no differently than being a Liberal in /r/republican.
What is this "outside" you speak of??!!!
this looks like a joke to me
Didn't they learn their lesson in 2016...?
Yeah, Biden doesn’t do great with the young, white, educated male demo aka Reddit.   Let’s hope he can try to energize them if he wins the nomination
I hate when elections are rigged by the voters so that the person who got the most votes wins the most delegates. Stupid voters.
Sjows the iq level.of bernies....same as trumpies

> the best place to find people with different ideas is to knock on doors.  I found this to be the best part of campaigning.
So Biden, I take it, is more analogous to Lib Dem for you and Bernie is closest to Labour?
i.e. Twitter
Biden specifically talked about that after the UK Election too. He knows that socialism doesn't do too well outside university campuses.
And alt-accounts don't work in real life.

I actually disagree on that, in recent days at least half of this sub came from Amy and Pete and the like. We all had our own preferences but instead of deluding ourselves we recognize Joe is the best choice to get behind, unlike S4P where Sanders is god emperor and every other candidate is “pure establishment corruption” bullshit  People here are still civil and can easily have discussions about the merits of other candidates respectfully even if they don’t support Joe, I’ve seen that numerous times so far. Not the case on S4P
As a moderator, I welcome Sanders supporters to post in here. The problem is that so many come to argue in bad faith. When we remove their trollish comments, it gives the appearance of an echo chamber.
Yeah I agree. That’s why I’m active on many political subreddits from politics to the_donald so I can gab many different perspectives on different issues
It is but it is explicitly labeled as Biden.  /r/politics is supposed to be neutral.
Seriously.   I've supported Bernie since 2016.  You know where I learned about things like CTH?  *Other campaigns' subs*.  I was disgusted by the sub because that isn't representative of what Bernie stands for.   I get that it is advantageous to your #1 if you paint the entirety of Sanders' campaign as a bunch of internet trolls but it just simply isn't true.  There is a reason it is a different sub- because that shit doesn't fly on S4P.  This is a manipulation game and it's been drilled out in ridiculous levels since Pete announced pulling from the race.   Biden is my number two,  but that doesn't mean we're not all on the same team.   Politics has polarized and people equate it to sports fandom.  You'll find that in any camp,  and people who are polarizing should be condemned- in any camp.   Any other year we'd be ignoring the trolls or blocking them.   For some reason now it seems appropriate to say they represent the whole of a campaign, which also alienates a *lot* of reasonable people.   I'm reporting or engaging any pro- Sanders troll wherever I see it and they're getting deleted or removed swiftly.  I urge you to do so as well instead of giving them a voice.
Usually I don't visit any political subreddit, but this whole Bernie thing has been spammed into places that have nothing to do with politics. It's annoying really how Reddit is going all Vote for Bernie with no shame.
If Bernie doesn’t get the nomination you’ll be amazed at how that subreddit will change overnight.   Hillary went from pure evil. To the best person ever as soon as true sanders campaign was suspended
Id go with "biased" or something like that cause god knows the words "rigged" and "colluding" are being overused by Bernie and Trump folks right now. When anyone else uses the actual rules it's "collusion" and "The Establishment!" But Bernie shouldn't even have to consolidate anything , for example, Warren should just fall on her sword and endorse him now , cause THAT would not be "collusion" but Pete or Amy endorsing Joe totally is.  And the low individual moderate support averages before SC were totally not cause the moderate vote was split! That was just cause Bernie is objectively lovable !
I got banned for mentioning he only got 1 bill passed (it was actually 3 which is not much better).
Reddit’s been doing this forever. Last 4 years with republicans and now any candidate not named Bernie.   People should have took a stand long a ago.
Not just banning. Who wants to make a comment in one of those subs that isn't pro-Bernie when it will just end in a bunch of downvotes and angry replies? They act like jerks to anyone with a differing opinion, so people with differing opinions stop posting.
RIP r/the_donald
As funny as this is, lets keep to the RoTR, lol.
Ha, somehow I missed that one. I know about "Dewey defeats Truman" though. Which year did that occur?
r/politicalcompassmemes is one of my favorite subreddits because A it’s hilarious and B people don’t actually give a shit about what the other’s political opinions are and all just laugh together

Thanks for looking it up. It seemed suspicious, even they aren't oblivious to how people typically view a BS bro to admit this in a comment.
Photos, screenshots, and jokes aren't all memes. A meme is a very specific thing.
"And yet you participate in society. Curious!"  "I am very intelligent."
Kind of.  Bernie is Corbyn's Labour.  Biden would be New Labour (Tony Blair).  Pete would be Lib Dems.  Bloomberg and Klob would be Cons.
Hopefully. We need to make sure our elections stay secure, though.

The CIA confirmed that Russia is trying to help Bernie’s campaign. The appropriate response is vigilance and critical thinking before you upvote or repost.  Their explicit goal isn’t clear and it might just to get Bernie supporters to not vote in the general, or hate everyone else so much that they vote for trump.
Bernie’s a Democrat? Somebody should tell him that.
It is what it is.
> People here are still civil and can easily have discussions about the merits of other candidates respectfully even if they don’t support Joe, I’ve seen that numerous times so far. Not the case on S4P  But I think that's u/Dahuey64 's point. Biden/Pete/Amy/Beto campaigns naturally attracted civil people on reddit. But that doesn't mean there's a large amount of people out there that aren't willing to listen and respond in a civil manner to arguments.       Although, I would argue that the majority of people in the US are more akin to this sub than S4P. But that's because the majority of people in the US are not on reddit :)
Excuse me!!!!! That’s super rude.   I can have a total civil and respectful discussion on s4p  Oh wait. No I can’t. I was banned for refuting a bullshit lie about Pete.
Sure, there's differing levels of civility in different spaces. The point is that this is still a space where everyone largely agrees with each other and it's valuable to get perspective from outside of that space every once in a while or actually take other viewpoints seriously.
I really hope we can maintain the civility.  Before Biden's surge, the worst I saw on this sub was people using the name "Gloomy" for Bloomberg.  Now, there's been disgusting memes (which /u/ctrlaltdelmarva had complained about and had his thread locked for) and in this thread, there are people mocking them whole "tendies" spiel.  I hope we can maintain the ideals of respect, dignity, and unity that Biden is trying to restore to our politics, and not stoop to the_donald-esque levels of toxicity.
I'm Canadian so I have no vote or anything but as an external viewpoint do you see people actually rallying around Biden and going out to vote for him in greater numbers than Trump. I don't see many people truly excited about Biden, to me he is a slightly different flavour than Hillary.  Or is it more of a policy thing and you just disagree with Sanders fundamentally.
Folks, let's be cool to Bernie's people tonight.
Let’s promise to be better. Let’s set the example that we support our candidate, not tear down opponents.
Agreed. I actually admire the hell outta their passion. We'd be well served to have one or two over here.
I admire Pete's ROTR, and I know Joe does too. Let's be our best selves.  I've supported many candidates who have lost various elections, and kindness goes a long way.   We're only going to win this together.
Most Bernie supporters are sane, decent people. It’s the rest I can’t stand.
Yes, this. Exactly this.
I am not US citizen. But in my country (Czechia) I've been voting for a party that's been loosing since 2013! Hate from political opponents plays big role in what's keeping me voting for different party.   Don't be hateful, bitter or negative in any way towards Bernie's supporters. Acting as such is how you loose them, not win them for your cause. Respect and gratefulness is the way to go!
>Let's be cool. 😎  You forgot this: 🍦
Bernie Sanders supporter here from Louisiana. I want to coalesce around Biden and vote for him, but I wanna see how he does in this next debate. If he does well, then I'll vote for him in the primary. Yet, most assuredly, I will vote and campaign for him in the general.
This is the worst time to be a supporter of a candidate. Watching it slip away when there's nothing you can do to stop it. Warren, Hillary, Russ Feingold, Mary Burke, Tom Barrett, it hurts.
We also have to unconditionally forgive their bad actors for the mean and cruel things they have said to us.
So I'm probably more conservative than liberal.  If the republican party was sane I'd likely be voting for them.  But I just wanted to come in here and say that it's very likely that Joe gets my vote.  I know the Bernie bros go crazy over the notion of pulling in moderates to vote for the democratic nominee.  But I really think Joe's going to take this election.  I think there are a lot of people out there like me who want a candidate who's a bit closer to the center, and who has a legitimate shot at working across aisles get things done.
All Biden supporters are to hold your Bernie brothers and sisters close, protect them and greet them as your own. Protect them and treasure them.  They ran well and this is what happens during campaigns.  Nobody, not one single soul, should be hard on them.   Period.  If any of those that would harm them, report them and those people aren't followers of Biden's or the Democratic party.  Stand up for them. Shield them. Help slay their trolls that would harm them.  We're stronger together!
Thank you for this.
This right here. Bernie supporters have more in common with us than either of us have with Trump supporters. The time for the competition of ideas among our side is soon to draw to a close. Then we need to mend fences, declare truces, and come together to defeat quite literally the worst president in my own lifetime.
I agree. It’s not just the internet. I know some people in real life that are disappointed. We are more alike than different.   Whoever wins, let’s beat Donald Trump!!! If Bernie makes a comeback I will do what I can for him like I would for Joe.
I'll keep my mouth shut, but I won't be offering them any condolences.  And Bernie had better give some serious consideration to dropping out, and soon.  If he lies to his supporters like he did in 2016, giving them false hope that the superdelegates would flip for him and dragging things out until June, it is not going to give his supporters time to lick their wounds and unify with the Dems before November.
As put by   *gulps*   Melania Trump, Be Best.
Avid Bernie supporter here, who sees the writing on the wall. It's over for us. We ran a hell of a campaign for the betterment of our fellow man but in the end it is what it is. I have no problems fully supporting Biden now, and have much less reluctance in voting for Biden than I did Hillary in 2016. It's time for unification and turning the White House, Congress and the Senate blue.
They'll come around. The ones saying that they'll not be voting for Biden will cool off hopefully
This is the truth. They need some time to grieve. A lot truly believe in him and his movement. We can’t bring them in and help unite the party if we are nasty to them in the coming day/week. We must not be toxic.
Thanks for these (mostly) warm and welcoming sentiments. NGL, still reeling a bit from the live results coming in.  If I had to vote tomorrow? No, I doubt I could swing around that fast to support Joe. But there’s plenty of time between here and November and I’ll be around quietly reading the sub and trying to get excited again.  Congrats to Team Biden for some strong results tonight.
In other words let's not have any malarchy in here tonight!
Thanks for keeping us in line! I've been doing a lot of arguing with Sanders supporters today on r/politics, and while I haven't been rude or anything, at a certain point, relentlessly trying to argue with them doesn't really do much good. I'm glad that people on here encourage us to be our better selves. I can see how in communities where it is the opposite, people can get really ugly really fast.
Bernie supporter here. Most of us have come to terms with where we are already after super Tuesday. Keep in mind that for some it's more painful because with primaries scheduled the way they are you may never get to vote for him.  Bernie or bust people talk about from '16 isn't 2020. You'll still see it, please ignore it. There will always be some in every election but this group is *seriously inflated* with fake personas and we face the same attacks as everyone else online.   Remember we are not a bunch of 20 year old college students who'd rather wait in line for ice cream than vote. We are just largely under 45 and in that age group it really is the most diverse. So try to remove the visual of a college student if you have it.   Biden will need us all to win. If you campaign for him try to learn from the Sanders organizers. Come November the voter suppression will be a factor and in places like Nevada they rode on horseback to canvas where there were no roads, in rural Texas and PA they've often been the only presence, in CA they knocked on 1mil doors. We'll all be there to defeat Trump, so keep in mind what we can contribute and let's work together.
I'm a Bernie supporter and was just banned from /r/sandersforpresident for saying that people should still vote Dem and primary Biden in 2024 (or hope that he retires) with a progressive candidate. Absolutely incredible how much that sub has devolved to a cult.
Don't be afraid to fight their lies with kindly placed facts and sources.

I suppose I can respect that. I was a warren supporter, then moved over to Bernie because I can't have children unless I get rid of my student loans before the age of 55. Anyway, I have to say that my biggest concern with Biden is that he may not be the savior that cnn has made him out to be. I respect what he has done, and I will vote blue no matter who but I feel like this will be 2016 all over again. I can hear burisma, and hunter being shouted like emails and I am deeply worried that the party may compromise on Biden only to realize that the GOP will fight like the dirty scum they are instead of the respectable opponents of decades past. It will be bad, and I hope you guys are right, if he wins the nomination. I think we should all say godspeed to those who are fighting for democracy, because we will all need it come November.
I *want* to agree with this sentiment.  But I feel that any remark, no matter what, would be seen as an attack on Bernie, if posted on Politics.    Politics isn't Sanders⁴Prez, but they act like it is.  And I am not going to pretend it wasn't invented to discuss *all* US politics, not matter what the last few months felt like.
"And his name is Trump. You might as well use it; he's going to try to kill you either way."
No malarkey.
I appreciate this post. Primaries are basically over, but they're not over over so I'll hope for a 'miracle' for the hell of it.  In the meantime -  Can you all give me a stance or two that Joe has that makes you all passionate about him? A strong policy that I can get enthusiastic about? I'd rather not go third party again this election! I'm in Alabama, so because of the EC & education level in my state my vote is worthless unless it's 3rd party. However if there's something Joe stands for that gets me excited I could proudly vote for him
Bernie has not dropped out and to the best of my knowledge Russia hasn’t stopped supporting him  I do think you have to make a judgement call on Bernies supporters who are sincere, you do want to bring them along - but you have to have a critical eye. The history is the history.   I will feel 100% differently when Bernie drops out and I’m sure I’m not talking to a nefarious actor - until then, there is an asterisk next to them.   You promote Joes policies, his character, his record - but talking about the impact of Bernies policies is also fair game imho. He has Marxist policies, and until he concedes we should keep telling people the difference between Joe and Bernie
Bernie's people being a bag of...kids is what brought me here in the first place. Early voted for Bernie in 2016 and early voted for Bernie again in 2020. Both times I quit /r/Sandersforpresident and /r/politics because of how incredibly annoying, toxic, and conspiracy mongering they have been. I love his ideas but I do not love his people.
I think Joe is going to incorporate a lot of ideas from Bernie to do more to make college affordable, increase access to quality healthcare, etc. As Yang said last night - Liz, Bernie, are all going to have a voice in joe’s administration
Biden Bernie
I remember the exact same posts in 2016. Kumbaya and all that. But the Russian/Conservative interference in this process is strong.   It is hard as hell to penetrate those bubbles created, and countering the actual fake news.   I don't even have a half-ass suggestion to counter this, just throwing what I believe the main problem we face as Democrats today.
I agree with the sentiment, but it's quite hollow when it becomes popular only after Bernie is no longer a political threat. Many in this subreddit could have done a better job being fair when it was costly to do so.  I have long favored Biden, but I greatly dislike political manipulativeness that's admittedly a necessary part of campaigning, so it rubs me the wrong way that this plea for relaxed behavior would emerge only today.  Particularly, because your plea is packaged with giving Trump the Voldemort treatment.   While I think Trump is a very bad president, possibly the worst one ever, whoever follows him is going to have to be president to the entire country. Will we see similar hypocritical calls for patience or sympathy with the inflamed emotions of Trump supporters post-election, following the demonization of them we will surely see in the following months? (Even literal demons can be demonized, and Trump supporters fall far short.) Perhaps worse, will we not even bother for the hypocrisy?   I would like if people could avoid making the same mistake twice.  Empathy and openness to others' perspective should not be a tactic. Partisanship needs to be avoided all the time, not just some of the time - even when the partisans on the other side are terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad people (or seem like it, from within one's own perspective).
Peace and unity
I will vote for Biden in the general if he wins the nomination but I do not think that he will beat trump. A Biden nomination is a nomination for four years of getting nothing done and no change. Sanders is the only candidate that is offering up a vision for actual change, Biden just wants to maintain the status quo, which if you haven't noticed, sucks ass and crushes the hopes of most average Americans
Genuine input here, so hear me out:  If you think that Bernie voters are going to come over to Biden, you sorely misunderstand why they vote for Bernie in the first place. They do not view things like you do.  This isn't about who is their preferred flavour of Democrat, this is about rejecting ineffectual centrism that always capitulates to the whims of big capital at the expense of people. This is about breaking the US-system that has dominated for decades, and resulted in two parties that basically represent the same thing.  To Bernie voters, there is no real difference between Biden and Trump in outcome, only in their style. Biden is the civil, friendly face of American hegemony and capital, and Trump is its nasty face.  You have to understand this: Bernie supporters aren't going to go over to Biden, *they simply won't vote*. I've been following the campaign closely, but were I eligible to vote in the USA and Biden was the candidate, I wouldn't vote either. Bernie has, by far, *the largest* bloc of voters who will not support *anyone* other than their candidate.  And, as a result, Biden will lose to Trump.
I like how you didn't include "So do we" until after the wanting a better country part, and didn't try to set it up after "they believe very strongly about what ideas their candidate stands for".
> Bernie's people are passionate. They are intense  They're also violent and hateful and don't like America. These ones should NOT be welcomed.
That’s your opinion, Trump has been like every president in my life basically except openly crass. Throwing my vote away is supporting someone who doesn’t align to any of my political beliefs. You won’t scare me with none sense like this. If we ever had a chance to build an independent party now would be the time. Sanders would easily get 20-30% of the vote. Then both parties would be forced to be more genuine.
I'm a Democrat, but I think it's up to you guys to convince me to still vote in the election. I do not like Joe and I do not like Trump, and I am not voting for the lesser of two evils again unless a solid group of people can convince me otherwise.   Why is Joe worth my vote? Because of Trump? If that's the only good reason, I really am not voting for president. I'll vote for the house and senate.
ROTR!
Giving a vote to someone before they compromise on ideas is giving them the ability ignore you. Have something to run on besides I’m not Trump and maybe you guys will win. Or just get Trump to be your vp!!! Bernies unwavering 30-40% of people that want to vote blue is how you win,  but we will vote Trump or Independent if you don’t compromise and run a progressive platform.  It’s that simple, just like 2016. I hope y’all start really living in reality.
It's just so painful. Bernie spoiled me with his lifelong consistency to being brave and standing for what's right *before* it was popular and/or widespread, especially in the political arena. A man who fights for the future today. We'll end up voting for Biden but it will be somewhat bitterly. To me, there will never be a man like him in public office again. The progressive peeps we have now don't have to be forward or brave as the ideas are in place, they just need to be strong. But going back decades, there he was, advocating for the future. It makes me so incredibly sad. I'm completely spoiled. He gave me hope again, but it's not going anywhere. Its crushing.  I'm here to try to learn more about Biden (Bernie stole my heart in 16). The contrast between them is so hard. I'm not trying to offend, but it's tough (not to try not to offend, but to depart from the hope he inspires).  Edit: Stemming from this election cycle I'm really wondering if a third party could get off the ground these days. While moderate Dems and more progressive ones have a lot in common, there is also enough contrast for a sad divergence. I don't know anymore.
Belonging is perhaps the most important of the Rules of the Road. We all belong in this movement, no matter who we originally supported, no matter who we feel is the best choice. At the end of the day, the left along with our Never Trump brothers and sisters from the right (as Pete likes to call them, future former Republicans) must unite and defeat Trump.
shoutout ROTR! <3
Joe does too? Is this part of the ROTR? https://twitter.com/BoKnowsNews/status/1237387463246708736?s=20
Honestly they're even a bit more closeted than trumpers irl or just not as vitriol in the wild. I have yet to meet a Sanders supporter that wasn't kind about it in public or in the work place. Even with me and my Pete stickers and hat. Ironically enough the ones I know personally are what I consider low information voters. You try to engage them about other candidates and what their policies might be and it's clear that they have made no attempt to look into any of it. Sometimes they don't even seem to know what it is Sanders is running on either.  Or even more frequently they say they are a Sanders fan but it becomes clear that they don't intend on voting in the primaries.
And they are ultimately going to fight like fuck to beat Trump. They’re just going to need a minute before they’re willing to gear up for the next fight.
This implies a skewed or cut off distribution - boo to that implication.
I'm sure they feel the same about those who by extension supported the war in Iraq.
Thanks for sharing! I truly hope we can all unify behind Vice President Biden and help him win in November!   PS — Czechia is a beautiful country! I visited more than 10 years ago and still consider it to be one of my favorite trips ever.
Hey now this is some wholesome stuff right here. Thanks for sharing.  It's my hope on top of hope that this election and the Dems (and our republican and left wing brothers and sisters in arms) can bring back some light to America in the world.  I'm the only one in my family born in the USA. I remember when we'd visit family in Europe, people would really love on our country. They made fun of us being stupid and silly, but it always made me proud to be from here when I heard other people say good things we've done in the world.  I really want that back. I want to know America still stands for something. Thanks for reminding us how important that is this election cycle.
Side bar, I visited Czechia last year! Did all the Prague tourist stuff and even spent a few nights in cesky krumlov (my favorite part). You have a fantasticly beautiful country, amazing food, with beautiful people! My wife and I absolutely will be coming back.  Na zdraví!
Hopefully Trump won't be reelected like Zeman...
Welcome to the discussion!  My wife's family are of Bohemian descent, and we rented a little black Skoda and toured your country for 9 days a few years ago. Breathtaking place, and the people were all so friendly.  Probably our favorite foreign country we've visited.  Where about are you from?
This next debate is going to be interesting.  Cant wait to see how it unfolds.
Bernie gets to be the "heckle" candidate again , which is his strength. Basically, why didn't you get M4A, Why didn't you do this, that, etc, while claiming only he could get those things done.  The reality is he can't get them done and he knows that and it's disingenuous and borderline unethical to continue to claim that he could get free 4 year University (Joe is trying for 2 year community college), free healthcare, etc.  Unfortunately it will work as it did with Trump promising to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. It will hurt the party and Biden and increase the Bernie or bust movement but ultimately won't matter in the Dem primary. Bernie is done. It's Biden v Trump.  I've already seen a massive amount of "Biden = Trump" in this thread and others and believe the Sanders campaign is coordinating that message as a whisper campaign.
Howard Dean :(
So many people dropped out recently and all those voters are finding their way to Team Joe.  Hope Bernie voters can do the same when the time comes.
As a fellow Pete supporter I got some of this too, in nasty private messages after Pete dropped. I get it.  But yeah, we actually do have to forgive those things, at least the ones made by actual Americans and not just (Russian) trolls. Because passionate people do say stuff they regret later. I sure have. Be magnanimous. Be like Pete, basically.
READY AND WILLING. reporting for duty, sir!    I will delete all the screenshots i've saved of some of the worst things said to me over the past months. all will be forgiven.    now lets go get the Don together!!
Or at least just acknowledge that their bad actors are a small, vocal minority and nowhere near the majority of Bernie supporters. The vast majority of them are passionate and have the same goals as us
You should be proud of the campaign you supported, and of yourself for giving a shit about making life better for Americans. Bernie has done a hell of a job in the last 4 years getting America to talk seriously about progressive politics. Making positive change is a slow process in America, but it’s always worth it.
🗽🇺🇸🌊 that's what I like to hear -- time to put aside differences and save America
And we need the intelligence and passion of Bernie supporters to win the next fight
This has to do with lives. I'll probably be downvoted(scared I will.. hi mods please don't!), but it's bigger than any of us. (hopefully y'all won't block/ban me aka please don't it won't help me to come around to vote for Biden. I just have to say this. My heart is urging me.)  I'm sincerely worried about Biden's frailty and if he were the nominee I'd feel guilty to vote for him. I've spent hours upon hours reviewing footage both edited and unedited alike and debated Biden supporters hoping they can defend him. They have yet to. This is serious. I might give Biden a chance, but his behavior is increasingly close to Trump's. I came to my own conclusion after having panic attacks about this. Biden will lose. The status quo kills and he does nothing, but alienate Bernie's supporters that are tired of dying and struggling to survive day to day. I suffered during the Obama years too. Biden won't change anything meaningful for me.. that's why people are Bernie or bust. Open your hearts and minds to believing in an America that protects us all. I'm scared of Biden and it doesn't seem like anyone can defend him at this point. I'd feel selfish to vote for him or Trump morally. I can't vote for a man that looks as if he is deteriorating in front of my eyes; I find that so cruel. He needs to enjoy himself and relax.. I can't imagine how much the presidential office would do to him. I don't want to be a part of breaking a man down. He's human. He deserves to be well as long as he can be. (I bet someone is gonna ban me after this.. sigh. Good luck voters. )     I'm still open to discussion. I'm open for people to defend Biden. I'm terrified. Please help.
This is great. Right now there are a lot of us who don't want to vote for president at this moment. I know it can sound ridiculous, but some of us feel like the DNC needs to hear our voice. And some of us feel like we will be heard by not supporting the candidate that the DNC wants us to vote for. Please do NOT put us into a corner and make us feel stupid. Bernie supporters are frustrated and we need some convincing that Joe isn't just a shell for the DNC.   We want someone real who has always fought for our rights, and I would love examples of how Joe does this. I want to be convinced to vote for him, honestly, but he honestly just feels like a Republican disguised as a Democrat.
I think it's cause your posts were starting to be hostile to people that don't agree with you that mexico abortion comment was uncalled for dude. I hope you're better than this
I think a good chunk of us are from all over at this point. I made good friends with a yangganger the other day in here, lol.    I don't even think most OG Joe supporters think he's some kind of superman Jesus figure either.    But he's a good guy, that the democratic base can clearly turn on a dime to rally around.    So while I'm sad it's not Pete this year, I can be excited as fuck to run Trump out of town in November. Honestly... kicking out an incumbent with infinite money and zealot-like support... that is a fucking FEAT... i feel like that is something we can all be excited and pumped for. LESGO!
Former YangGang ngl Joe was not my top pick. Yang and Warren were. But hes the nominee and nothing is more i portant then beating Trump so here I am.
Loool nice reference
Expand ACA. I know Bernie people wants M4A. But expanding ACA is a step in that direction, and has the advantage of being actually achievable.  And, of course, stop putting kids in cages. Get the neo-nazis out of the White House.
The way I see it, a vote for Biden is a vote to let RBG retire. That's what I'm passionate about.
Sad that you got downvoted, since this is the only way that Biden will gain the support of Bernie supporters.
I get it, but I'm not worried. Here's why.  1) Biden isn't Hillary. the main reason Trump won was who he was running against, namely a uniquely unpopular, polarizing candidate.   2) Trump hasn't expanded his base. Like, at all. He thinks if he can keep his party in line he can win the same way. But there are going to be way fewer undecided voters this time out, and the expanded turnout is a very good sign for us.   3) Biden, not Trump, is the one running against a uniquely unpopular, polarizing candidate this time.   4) and there are *definitely* enough people who are going to be persuaded by the argument "can you really stand four more years of this?" You're already seeing it in the turnout, just like you saw in 2018.
I only hope that whoever is chosen can face off against Trump.
It goes without saying that we all want a better country. This is a post about Bernie supporters, not us.
disagree. We should forgive. its the right thing to do. and we do the right thing here, friend. be cool.
if you're so lazy that you can't even type joebiden.com or look up a speech on youtube then you just want attention. Bye
If you think that a public option is even remotely better than the shitshow we have now, then vote Biden.
Biden is likely to repair the institutional competence of government and US standing with international allies, both of which are very important but often neglected, since campaigns focus on promised legislation, which I think is unfortunate. He has proven competence as a policymaker, and is likely to attempt moderate, politically pragmatic, and evidence-backed reforms in any areas he can. Unless you think he is bad at identifying worthwhile reforms or that you have a better grasp of political expediency than a longtime expert, you should want to vote for him. If you think he's bad at identifying worthwhile reforms, you'll have to describe why for others to engage with your point of view.
https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/  Here's Joe's positions. If you want a quick example, Biden wants a $15 minimum wage for america.
People said this exact same thing in 2016 and then Trump put a literal rapist on the Supreme Court bench who will sit there for the next 30 years. You want him to choose another when RBG passes away?
So proud that this campaign has embraced ROTR.
Bernie voter, Warren preferred person here.... I will ROTR. Cheers Dems! We are the party go good trouble! Civil rights! The ACA, and.... THE MOON SHOT.  Also if anyone has a time machine,... Can we have Al Gore 2000, he was right.
YESSSS!!! rotr 4 lyyyfe! <3
If you do choose to throw your vote away to an independent candidate or vote Trump because your candidate doesn’t win the nomination to a party he’s not a member of, then don’t you dare think about complaining about the next four years of Trump.
What I was hoping is that Trump would be the end of the Republican Party, which would cause the Democratic Party to grab a lot of conservative voters and shift right and a new Bernie Party (name pending) to form to the left of where the Democratic Party is now.  Unfortunately, Republicans have coalesced around Trump in spectacular fashion. He has something like 94% approval rating among Republicans. There is also little sign to my knowledge that the Republican base is shrinking.  Therefore there’s simply not room for two left-wing parties. If Bernie’s faction split off, then Republicans would sweep every single election. That’s the unfortunate reality of our current system.  I would point out that you have a rose-tinted image of Bernie. While he’s certainly an impressive public servant, he has many flaws. He seems to be utterly incapable of compromise, which is honestly nearly disqualifying for a politician. Compromise is an essential part of effective governance and politics. Look at how quickly Bernie’s supporters attack Biden for simply stating he will try and reach across the aisle. Since when is compromise a dirty word? If you want literally nothing to be accomplished in four years for the sake of ideological purity, then a “my way or the highway” approach is fine, but if you actually care about effecting policy to improve the lives of Americans, compromise is a necessity.   I can point out some more major flaws with Bernie if you’d like, but this comment is getting long. Let me know if you’re interested and I’ll type out some other concerns I have. That might help to disillusion you that Bernie is somehow in his own tier that no other candidate will ever be close to. Can you not see how you’re idolizing him in an unhealthy way?
Unfortunately a third party will never work until we have a complete overhaul of the election system. First past the post doesn’t allow it through it’s very nature. If we switched to a parliamentary system maybe, but until then there’s only room for 2
I know it sucks, but you shouldn't give up hope of ever finding another politician who you like as much as Bernie. It's kind of like a breakup. You think you'll never find someone who you like as much as your ex, but you usually do.
I don’t think we’ll see third party candidates this cycle just because everyone knows how important it is to unite to defeat Trump.  Also, I hope the kindness of Joe’s supporters on this sub make it a little less bitter when you cast that vote for Joe.
> Bernie spoiled me with his lifelong consistency to being brave and standing for what's right before it was popular and/or widespread  Take heart that the reason these things became popular wasn’t some cosmic accident. It was because of Bernie, and passionate supporters like yourself, making the case for what you believe in.  In a way Biden and Bernie are very different, yes, but in a way, Bernie is still in this race. The Biden of today (running on a platform that’d make him the most progressive president since FDR) has been shaped immensely by Bernie’s influence on the party and the race.
the progressive movement can have a huge impact if the democrats win in november. Any legislation that is passed will require progressive votes. If the republicans win the progressive movement will have zero impact.   Biden is proposing a public option that is free to the poor. The progressive movement can strengthen that.   Biden is proposing free 2 year college and more student debt relief, the progressives can increase that.   Biden is proposing zero emissions by 2050, the progressives can push to move that date up.   The progressive movement will be stronger and actually have the chance for the first time to change the country if democrats win. I support medicare for all and free public college, but  I'm extremely hopeful for the progressive movement.
It is tough, because as someone whose been around the block in many elections, I can count the number of times I have voted FOR A CANDIDATE and not just to stave off some disaster in the Supreme Court on less than one hand.  But here is the thing, whatever you may think of Joe Biden, ALL of us would benefit from from such tremendous unity that not only is Trump ousted but everyone who still supports him loses all legitimacy.  Seriously, if everyone who still has the sense to be concerned about Trump comes together, we can kick this whole  business to the curb.  And THEN we can have productive arguments about the progressive vs moderate wings of the party--if that means splitting up, so be it.  Biden is a compromiser by nature.  That's good when he's building coalitions to further democratic  goals, and bad when he thinks he has to meet segregationists and anti-immigrant jingo-ists halfway.  It is better if he has less pressure from the right and if we all stand up together, we can do it.  Plus it would be damn satisfying to hand Trump his ass.
Biden voted for the Iraq war, against abortion access, gave a eulogy at storm Thurmond’s funeral after working with him against desegregation, against same sex marraige, has told the insurance companies and Wall Street it’s business as usual, will veto M4A even if it passes, tells voters they’re dumb asses and “I don’t work for you,” and he gets physically aggressive with them. That’s just off the top of my head.  Edit: can’t believe I forgot how he barred witnesses from testifying against Clarence Thomas in the Anita Hill trial.
Please Biden voters, do NOT go to any Warren sub and try to poach supporters. I know you guys don't do it anyway but just a reminder.
DO NOT FUCKING HARASS THE WARREN SUPPORTERS. Can't be stressed enough. You do it, you're a massive Asshole and you should feel bad about yourself as a person.
Don’t worry Warren supporters like me will come to you guys. Enjoying the positive energy, hope for more Bidenbro memes. Seeing Biden and Obama smile makes my heart happy.
This is why I like Biden. There's some class and respectability with how he presents himself and reasonable caution where there needs to be. It's cool to see it bleed through from his supporters
Former Warren supporter:  You won't win them all over, but I know for a fact the vast majority of Warren supporters will vote blue in the end.   The Warren faithful have been through hell (As other campaigns have) Trying to stay positive in a sea of negativity online, and stayed strong. The best way you can count them as allies is to respect them, respect their views and do what Warren herself did: Listen. Don't just preach.
Can’t upvote this enough. It’s critical that we give them space and just welcome and be respectful to those who stop by this sub.
When my candidate dropped out I was really bitter. It felt like supporters were gloating. I'm over it now, but anyone who gets in the face of someone who's candidate just dropped out and says, "vote blue no matter who," while that person is still grieving deserves a nasty yeast infection.  Just my opinion.  The ones who show up here cheerfully saying, "I used to support candidate xyz, but now I'm with you guys," are amazing and inspirational and much better people than I.
I really appreciate this sentiment. This hit HARD even though I knew it was coming.   I've been supporting Warren since her run for Senate in 2012 so the silver lining is that she'll continue being our senator. (MA here)  I won't mention the other progressive candidate and his supporters who have been urging her to drop out for months, saying she's a traitor and a snake.  And now they're aggressively mad her supporters aren't hopping over to that side. So I really appreciate Biden supporters being sensitive to Warren supporters.  One of the many reasons I support Joe going forward.
I really wish she had a Democratic governor. I would love it if she could become part of the Biden administration, but Gov. Baker will give her seat to a Republican if she left the Senate.
I'm a warren supporter. I have not seen a single Biden supporter do anything in the warren sub other than thank her for running a good campaign. Meanwhile I see several bernie supporters try this annoying crap, and one called me a chud for saying I'm leaning towards Biden now (had to google it, apparently a CTH pejorative for moderate dems). That tells us all we need to know. You guys have been nothing but respectful
I’m a Warren/Biden person. I’ve been in the Warren sub seeing it get mobbed all day by Bernie people. I haven’t seen a single Biden person doing that. Good on ya.
This. It's a very sensitive moment for them, pliz no spam
I lurked form like 10 mins but couldn't come up with anything constructive.   I think the Warren supporters might split 50-50 while Amy and Pete supporters came over as a block.
Pete’s rules of the road
The only thing you should be doing is venmoing Warren staffers money to help them buy drinks (they're all tweeting them). It's up to them to decide who to support-- they really had an incredible organization and even though I've been on the Biden train from Day 1.... it's still sad.
Definitely appreciated the space when I was recently in the same state of mind. Happy to see the RotR adopted here as well.
Let the Bernie supporters annoy the crap out of them, and they'll come over naturally.
Man, this is why I feel a-ok backing Biden as a Warren supporter. Y'all are decent folk and I appreciate your attitude. I dont agree with Joe on everything but by God I'm willing to help out
Warren used to use my office as a place to park when she had events in our city in MA.   She is a genuinely nice lady.  I’m a Biden supporter, but she’s a class act.
Biden would do well to give her a job writing policies or legislation or something...her comprehensive housing policy was really good and badly needed....
Is it okay that I posted this in reaction to a comment in r/enough sanders spam?  > As a biden supporter, I politiely ask you to consider Joe should that eventuality arise.
I like this, at the Sanders sub there's a tone deaf post inviting them and here we are like just leave them the fuck alone. Let them decide.
[removed]
I'm sure her supporters had a backup considering she was nowhere near winning any primaries. Nothing against her I like her a lot it just didn't work out this time.
As a refugee from the Warren sub, I wanted to thank you.  ALL of you, but especially the mods.  THIS is how you win support!  Many of the people in the Warren sub are grieving right now, because a candidate they love has dropped out.  They don't need someone badgering them about who they will vote for now and doing so will only drive them away.
It’ll probably just happen anyways and reddit won’t have much of an effect tbh
I feel bad now. Before I claimed to have not heard much about her, but like what I had heard. Now I’m starting to think it was a dick move for Sanders to announce instead of either staying quiet or endorsing her. I wanted to hug her at her announcement today.  Would’ve made a good president, but still is an excellent human.
Please don't make a problem when there is no problem, mods. It's really not happening.
Gotta say; it'll definitely be quite the show if a man like Joe Biden wins the presidency.    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ-YjGmpO4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ-YjGmpO4Q)
Thankfully as far as I see no Biden supporter is doing this but let's get the message out early that we are 100% a unifying and welcoming community so no Biden voter strays off the path
We'll ban anyone who does it too.
reminds me when Pete dropped out, we immediately got inundated by Bernie supporters. more than a few of us kindly reminded them of numerous "rat fuck" and "corporate shill" tweets and messages constantly directed our way.
That's what separates the Biden fans from Bernie fans.
Yea.  Let the Bernie bros do their usual toxic vulture harrassment on other subs (after a candidate drops out), instead of us.

As a former Warren supporter who is now 100% behind Biden, I couldn't agree more. Have been reading through his policies and there's a lot to like, especially the public option and ENDING HOMELESSNESS.
[Yet I like him for this video. He didn’t take any bullshit and it’s great](https://youtu.be/fbEJpr4A9mQ) Weird how we can like Biden for different reasons.
[removed]
I'm genuinely sorry it didn't work out. Warren was such a strong campaigner. In the end we have to be all in together right? So we'll for sure be on the same side no matter what. o7
I haven't always agreed with Warren (or with Biden,for that matter) butI've always respected her as a politician. She has real accomplishments in her career and is an intelligent,policy driven legislator. She ran a great campaign. She was theonly candidate who didn't have a sudden increase in super only to fizzle out. She has a months long trend of growing super slowly driven by her knowledge, plans that had specific details, and her passion for her beliefs. It's depressing that she ultimately feel in the polls for being honest,both about paying for M4A and that it wouldn't happen immediately. In a better world it would be Warren,not Sanders, who would be one of the final two candidates (in convinced Tulsi meant to drop out but forgot,and thinks she already did). I'd rather risk losing to a Warren than probably beat Sanders. I don't louvre her policies as much but we would benefit from a rigorous and civil debate of ideal. We would get that with Biden-Warren. We aren't going to get it with Biden -Sanders.
I’m an undecided Warren supporter and I’m stopping by! Hey guys!
Absolutely!   Coming from Pete’s camp one of the things that drew me to Biden (along with Pete’s endorsement) was the community and ROTR.  I’d lurked on Bernie’s sub enough to know that it wasn’t for me, and the comparison with you all was refreshing enough to draw me in without active recruitment.
I have literally never seen any Sanders supporter say anything like this for the last few years. Being kind, welcoming, and sympathetic will get you so much farther than being nasty.   Thank you!!
[removed]
This is my experience as well!    I was a Kamala supporter.  After she dropped I just wandered in the desert.   Rep. Clyburn's endorsement, along with Joe's showing in SC, brought the picture into focus for me and now I'm TOTAL JOE.  But I had to go through all the stages of mourning before I could make the jump!  Warren supporters will find their path.  Some will go to Bernie, but I hope most choose Joe.
Speaking only for myself, I think we could have done more to consider the feelings of those candidates who dropped out earlier. I've tried to really make up for that by extending positivity to the Pete, Amy, and Warren folks (who I actually voted for after a lot of agonized deliberating). Hope y'all feel the love too.
> The ones who show up here cheerfully saying, "I used to support candidate xyz, but now I'm with you guys," are amazing and inspirational and much better people than I.  Some of the people saying that are just lying though. When you look at their post history they've just been Biden supporters the whole time. Playing optics.
[removed]
🐊🐍🐊🐍🐊🐍🐊 we welcome all our reptilian friends :D  (Biden supporters use the crocodile emoji on Reddit)
Agreed completely.
Cabinet posts are also overrated, being a senator is usually better
I think MA has a special election within 160 days or so, IIRC. So the Republican Governor can only have his pick in until the election. I think the Dems can win that election. I think Warren being part of Biden's administration would be really cool (would love to see her as VP to unite both Dem camps).  Also in MA, there is a young Kennedy trying to challenge Ed Markey, John Kerry's successor in the Senate. It would be a shame to lose someone who is passionate about energy and climate change. Warren strategically moving into the Biden administration would let Kennedy shred any GOP challenger in the special election, while maintaining Markey in the Senate.
If Charlie Baker does that, his career is over and he knows it. He'd never hold office in MA again, and he's far too liberal to dream of a career in Trump's GOP. I wouldn't worry about that one bit.
She could run for Senate leader.
CHUD literally means  Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dweller (it's from a horror movie lol)  Yeah... they are a friendly bunch right?
Keep in mind that it might have been a troll.  I've seen someone on r/ conservative encourage people to spam Bernie or Bust after the Iowa debacle.  I think its not all actual berniebros that are responsible for this behaviour. I feel we might be underestimating the number of trolls.
Yeah I’ve gotten nasty pm’s from some. Honestly I think if Bernie got the nomination (I don’t think he will) and normal mainstream democrats started supporting Bernie they’d freak out. They enjoy being counter cultural. I think Joe will pull most people together well, it feels like a relief to have the ups and downs of February behind and we can start building a coalition against trump.
[removed]
I feel like it was a sensitive moment for all women, even as a Biden supporter when I woke up to the news I sat down and cried for a bit. Elizabeth Warren makes me proud to be a woman, her loss is everyone’s loss in the end. She’s 100% right that this fight isn’t over and I personally wanna see her as VP, breaking the second highest ceiling in the nation would be massive.
Don't do it on reddit, I would suggest if you have a friend who supports Warren and they bring it up, be nice to them and tell them why you'd want to have them support Biden. When it's a friend they know you're not a vulture but actually give a shit, so it's different. But if they don't mention it to you, don't go to them at least for a few days.
The subs are really bad indicators, just remember that a ton of Bernie supporters larped as Pete supporters and declared their "switch" to Bernie.
The most recent poll from today does have it as a pretty even split, I think it was 43-36 in Sanders' favor for who gets Warren's voters.
It's what got me to be a Pete supporter the short while between Yang dropping out and Pete dropping out.
haha send $20 with a diamond emoji... drinks or ice cream on Diamond Joe
You can write legislation in the senate! It's already her job, not trying to be a wise guy
probably man, it's a different ballgame outside Warren's sub. Just be as polite as possible. Also spellcheck :)
If we leave them alone, the Bernie supporters will drive them all over here anyway.  Just let nature take its course.
[removed]
First of all thank you and second of all if you feel up for it you are always welcome here.   Second off... just so you know, I'm not a mod haha I don't want people to get the wrong impression. The mods DID ask people not to bug Warren supporters but I don't want people to think anything I say is a mod-approved thing cause it's not, it's just me.
I understand and respect this is the Biden sub, but as a Warren supporter I genuinely feel like she was the best person to be president. My heart is just shattered because god, what an incredible human being. Just such an intelligent, collected and passionate woman. It feels like Donald Trump is controlling the Democratic Party in a sense because we focused more on who could beat Trump rather than who could best tackle the needs of our hurting nation.  But I’m supporting Biden going forward. I already voted for Liz and will cherish that for a long time. But I hope he brings her on as VP as a way to bridge the divide between progressives and moderates. I think that’s the biggest challenge we face now going forward.  Thanks for being good people and not poaching. We feel a bit in limbo and kinda homeless, but many people on Twitter recognize Bernie is a sinking ship. He should never have run this election - i could only dream of Warren and Biden being the final two in this race.  But forward we go! Persist! Dream big, fight hard America.
No one is saying there is a problem man, and BTW not a mod. Warren supporters I think appreciate we are on high alert for malarkey.
I love your username!
Ur here 😳👀
I believe it would be beneficial if we stop saying bad things about anyone's fans, even Bernie's at this point. We're going to need them too down the road so don't gloat or get personal. Combat nasty name calling and personal attacks with facts and polite rebuttals if you want to be the best surrogate for the civility of the Biden team. Your restraint will shine through to all the eyes reading along.   You diplomacy and civility will illustrate the lack of diplomacy of the other side if it is missing. I believe we need to put our own egos and hurt feelings aside for the good of the country.  It's important to show grace in defeat and triumph because grace is the opposite of Trumpism.
And Biden from Bernie. Among many other things
What is that?
You where referring to Biden as "our candidate" months ago.   ???
That clip reminds me of the 2008 election when McCain shut someone down after they called Obama an Arab.
[removed]
Same here.   And the sincere follow-up from the Biden campaign has really been soothing.   He didn't say thank you for the endorsement and then move on (I worked for a Gubernatorial candidate in my state who dropped out with an endorsement and that is what happened to our folks), he has repeatedly given credit and thanks to the Pete, Amy, and Beto campaigns for their contributions to his Super Tuesday win.    This tells me that Biden isn't looking to be the King of All, but a leader of a talented TEAM, and he's willing and happy to surround himself with good people with whom he happily shares credit.     A stark contrast to the populist cult of personality technique that dominates the Trump administration and...let's just say "other campaigns."
I was always torn between Beto and Kamala, though I liked Warren too. So after Beto dropped out, of course I went to Kamala and she dropped out a month later. So I just was kind of a neutral observer after that, apart from a few strong dislikes. I think we will see some amazing things from Kamala. She is so brilliant, to watch her cross examine anyone is a thing of beauty.  For now, though, eyes on the prize, let's go Joe!
And then they go post on the JoeBidan subreddit?  If they are going to be duplicitous, that doesn’t seem like an effective strategy.  I also don’t know if someone being sympathetic to Biden but ultimately for Warren until she dropped is really that nefarious.
>When you look at their post history they've just been Biden supporters the whole time  Some of us are just indecisive though
Why do we do that again?
Warren also honestly has a skill set that makes her a really good Senator, this isn't to say she wouldn't be good at running a department, but the Senate needs super detail oriented people with new ideas more than the executive branch does.
Dunno. She’d be pretty awesome as head of the SEC
But those first 160 days are really important. I imagine that RBG will probably want to retire basically immediately after Biden gets sworn in.  I hope that the Democratic supermajorities in Boston change the law to require Baker to appoint a Democrat as the interim senator.
He's term limited iirc.
Schumer is not retiring anytime soon. He just got the job in 2017.
Very true. I like Bernie and will be voting for him, but on certain subreddits and Twitter apparently I'm not die-hard enough for those Bernie fans. It's really, really odd to be lectured and told off by people who are on the same side,  and makes me think something fishy is going on. I seem to encounter this on social media.  As far as IRL goes, my husband gets a little too heated when talking about politics, so I have to remind him to chill out. He's never been an asshole about it, but when he starts talking about things he's passionate about, his voice gets really loud. I also told him to stop bringing up Sanders with EVERYONE we hang out with. Like can we please have a double date night where the husband's aren't debating about Capitalism vs Socialism.   Other people are entitled to their own opinions and beliefs and can vote for whoever they want. People seem to forget that things aren't black and white. There's asshole Bernie supporters and nice Bernie supporters. I've been trash talked by a Buttigieg fan and called names by Warren fans. But then I also have really great friends who love Buttigieg and very liberal friends that I love dearly who went for Warren, and you know what? That's okay! I'm so happy to see people engaged in politics and critically thinking about who deserves their vote.   And on the flip side, my most favorite student told me recently that his parents are Trump supporters. He told me their reasoning, and while I whole heatedly disagree with their beliefs, they still managed to raise a bright, talented, funny, and compassionate kid.   With all that said, I'm sorry some Bernie supporters are jerks. It really bums me out because it doesn't feel good to be like lumped in with douchebags and it doesn't represent Bernie's message of taking care of those in need.  Anyway, good luck to Joe. And my condolences to Warren supporters, I hope we haven't heard the last of her as she is an incredible, intelligent, hard working woman.
Yeah lol I've been posting here and getting some messages from bernie supporters begging me to reconsider. Like... if you're reading this, chill out guys. I assume it's because they got banned from this sub for bernieposting in the comments
Shoo.
Oh trust me, I know that Bernie has been on the right side of history. Whenever there was a civil rights protest, he was there. When congress was going to war in Iraq, he made a long speech until everyone left against it. I respect him tremendously for that. My problem with him is how divisive he is and his lack of coalitions. It especially hurts him because he wants such radical change. Even someone as well connected with the establishment as Biden would struggle to pass medicare 4 all. Bernie will have his bills go through the Republican wringer worse than Obama.
I agree it's everyone's loss. She ran a hell of a good campaign and in the and she fell I the polls because she was honest about paying for M4A,and that it wouldn't happen overnight. In a better world it would cone down to Biden and Warren so we could be guaranteeda good nominee,and we could get a rigorous debate on policy and ideas. We won't get that now,sadly. We need to have these debates. It would have been great for a woman to beat Trump. I don't think Warren will want to be VP (plus her Senate replacement be named by a Republican governor). But I think Biden will pick a woman running mate. What do you think about klobacher?
That is so pathetic. Also kinda nasty
Still waiting on the 538 Primary models.   Warren dropping out might have a lot to recalculate.  Warren had some Pete people switch over after New Hampshire but it is hard to tell in this internet world.
Yeah but you need to write the rules too which is how the sausage gets made...I feel like she needs to have a role in implementation.   It's not enough just to get the legislation through there wise guy...
That sub is their space. They need time to grieve. I felt that way when it looked like Bidenwas out and Sanders would be the nominee.  I hope they choose to support Bidenand I know well all welcome then,but bruising isn't the easy to build a coalition. Respect their sub.
Whoops. I’m usually good about that.
[removed]
Got it.  The fact that it did come down from the mods is good, though.    I have been lurking in here today and so far I like the atmosphere.  I am heavily leaning Biden's way right now, both on a practical standpoint (Biden has an enthusiasm problem, IMO, but I think Bernie has even bigger flaws against Trump) and because I think that Biden has a more realistic chance of getting something done if he wins.
@JoeBiden responds to Bernie’s “establishment” claims: “Bernie, you got beat by the overwhelming support I have from the African American community. You got beat because of suburban women. You got beat because of hardworking, middle-class folks.”
Leaning into this is super smart.
YES!!!   I love this!!  Effectively, he is showing that Bernie is discrediting voters and reducing them as establishment herd. LOVE THIS.
There really is no difference between Bernie yelling about 'the establishment' and Trump yelling about the 'deep state' at this point. It's a meaningless catch-all boogieman term for "anyone who doesn't agree with me" from paranoid old men and their cult-like followers.
Wish he would have closed this out with proceeding to put on his aviators and turn to enjoy a two-scoop ice cream cone.
Bernie gonna lose Latino vote (at least in Florida) praising Castro
Suburban woman here. Can confirm.
Meanwhile, Bernie is going full fraud by throwing a hail mary with an ad blitz using Barack Obama, whom Sanders would consider a "corporate establishment" candidate to convince young and black people that Obama likes him...even though it's using video from 14 years ago.
Bernie also got beat by his own attack dog supporters, who spend so much time denigrating other candidates that they pretty much destroy any possibility that Bernie can pick up their supporters when they drop out.  Let's see how the Warren supporters react to their candidate being called a snake.
Has a candidate ever won by bashing his own party so much?  (well, his party every 4 years when he needs it)
Bernie must have the worst advisors ever. Someone should tell him that lumping everyone who votes for someone other than him as “the establishment” isn’t a good thing. He’s divisive and many of his followers are online bullies and trolls.
Damn that is called staying on task and drilling in. Great messaging.
Morning Joe was *loving* this response. And I don’t blame ‘em!
He isn't wrong. At all. Bernie needs to broaden his appeal, or he will never win the *Democratic* nomination.  Bernie supporter for the time being, but I love Joe and love you all. Joe drove the turnout I was expecting Bernie would, and it was one of the most amazing political momentum changes I've ever seen.   I hope every staffer and volunteer is proud of what they did to contribute to that marvelous ST performance. That was nothing short of remarkable, and bodes incredibly well should Joe turn out to be the nominee!
Joe spent $625,000 in all 14 states on Super Tuesday, and won. His campaign was broke, not bought by billionaires. Bernie, maybe Diamond Joe is just the better candidate?
maybe after Bernie loses twice him / his voters will get the message
The backbone of America, keeping us safe. Appreciation cannot be overstated.
A message Bernie and his supporters need to hear but refuse to acknowledge because "rigged":  ***"The direction of a democracy is determined by the voters who show up."***
Sanders got beat because more than of his "revolution" supporters didn't vote.
Bernie got beat because he's going after young people and non-voters. Both groups of whom virtually didn't vote on tuesday.
Biden SPILLING THE TEA.
The establishment always wins.
DAMN. RIGHT.
\#truth
It’s like a rap battle. I can’t wait to see Bernie clap back and vice versa.
Can someone explain to me why Joe uses the “beat him/her/it/they” language? I understand he’s trying to emphasize his win and Bernie’s losses, but when he repeats it like this, is just sounds so caustic and violent even if he doesn’t mean it that way. Just trying to get up to speed with Joe!
I wish Biden would endorse UBI and VATS and ask Yang to be his VP. That would be a dream ticket that would annihilate Trump and Bernie in one move.
FUCK BIDEN  Joe  BidendeezNUTS

Sanders bragged about never working for a corporation. How many Americans have worked for one though? He's criticizing probably a majority of families.
But that’s what happened 4th 5th 2nd media collusion and losers corralled 1st. Biden was no ones first choice it took collusion and smears I’m man stepped down from his post due to smears. He was a news pundit. If you can deny alll this welcome back to 2016.
That's what I've been saying from the get go: Bernie is Trump, just in different clothing. Imagine if Joe said half of the delusional, paranoid and sometimes just outright mean things Bernie, Trump and their followers say. The media would eat him alive. Why is Bernie given a pass?  ^(Edit: I spelled paranoid wrong yikes)
It's exactly the same. I was telling someone this the other day. Bernie Bros on reddit and Trump fans are two sides of the same coin.
>Bernie yelling about 'the establishment'  dude been in gov forever , complains about "the establishment"  ok.jpeg
Gotta love how Bernie is now running a misleading ad with Obama praising him and when Rachel Maddow asked him if Obama is the establishment he says no but that Biden is lol.
The "corporations" and "billionaire class" didn't vote on Tuesday - regular people did, and they clearly chose Biden.
When I hear folks attacking "The Establishment" I am like "what problems do you guys have with the Congressional Black Caucus? What beefs do you have with the CRA and VRA?"  It's a bit facetious but it shows how meaningless the label is and that it is nothing more than "othering" for contrarian posturing.
Bernie fans:  "Bernie is the anti-Trump!"  Also Bernie fans:   Purity tests   Conspiracy theories   Intentional spreading of false information   Dunning-Kruger Syndrome   Cult-like devotion   Gaslighting   Confirmation bias
These monikers almost always backfire on candidates.  Trump supporters got a ton of mileage out of Hillary's "deplorables" comment.  Biden supporters should do the same with "the establishment".
Bingo. It's quintessential horseshoe theory.
So full disclosure I am a Sanders supporter, I am here just to see what kind of things are said about Bernie around here. I am seeing a HUGE number of comparisons drawn between Sanders supporters and Trump supporters. We need to remain united as democrats and refrain from driving the wedge any deeper.
Sounds completely right!
Don't forget manufacturing consent and MainStreamMediaConspiracy
Do we actually know who the "establishment" are who Sanders thinks is killing his campaign?  Is Joe part of the establishment? Is Obama? Is every billionaire in the nation regardless of political interest/party?  Choosing a vague group and saying "they are the ones to blame for this mess" is just conspiracy theorist thinking.

And the Jewish vote too.
I think deep down Bernie knows he is done and has gotten desperate
Warren when Sanders tries to play nice to get her endorsement:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LqcQii6Y_CU
Trump kinda did.
And it’s hard to explain it to his supporters because they’re so binary (you’re either 100% for Bernie or 100% against) and uncompromising.
the momentum shift really was crazy. i saw many people predicting he may drop out after super tuesday lol
I’ve been in certain subreddits. The establishment is screwing Bernie twice in a row...
I mean Biden has ran for president twice and also lost twice. He is making an exceptional run this time
The only thing  Sanders supporters hate more than Joe Biden is finding the time to vote for Bernie.
Who would have thought that non-voters would not vote?
The trick is to try to avoid using your primary opponents name where possible as to limit republicans capitalizing on sound bites. What is actually unusual here is Biden name dropping a primary opponent in an attack. But he did it because it was defensive from Bernie being Bernie and trashing everyone who isn’t him as corrupt.
Me too... Yang gang
I ain't a Yang guy but UBI's always been a policy I liked.
I like Yang, but I really don’t understand how UBI doesn’t result in various companies charging more, since they know how much more money people are making. I’m talking about things like rent/landlord.   I asked in Yang’s sub a while back and did not get a clear and satisfying response.
[removed]
He sure can get through a primary though.
I'm from the Silicon Valley (which by the way, very very progressive/liberal)  which has man big tech companies. I don't agree with Bernie's approach of antagonizing corporations when many can just move jobs and operations offshore to a friendlier country.  I think there is a fine balance between getting corporations to pay more taxes while also working *with* them, so they can continue to keep jobs here.  Btw:  Obama was on good terms with many tech leaders.
Bernie never had more than 30% support from Dems. It’s not collusion or smears, it’s that a vast majority don’t want Sanders to represent the Democratic Party.
> Why is Bernie given a pass?  The same reason Trump is made out of teflon: an utter lack of shame. He just ignores what doesn't match his world view.
Idk if i would go quite to call them the exact same. Both are certainly populist and with that carry many of the problems of it, but i feel that Bernie still wants to do good for America while Trump does not in any way want that
He doesn’t get a pass from me!
Bernie is only given a pass by his kind...just as Trump is given passes by his kind
We're going to build a big, beautiful ~~wall~~ health care system, and ~~Mexico~~ Wall Street is going to pay for it!
I agreed. The worst thing is that when I bring he is a populist they say "there is nothing wrong about that" 😒
Just wondering what “mean” things has Bernie said?
.....have you ever even read biden's voting history? he literally voted to overturn the protection of women's right to abortion...he voted to keep schoolbuses segregated....i'm no bernie bro but your statement couldn't be more backwards....i literally can't believe how illiterate the american populace is......we're doomed
I've been saying the same thing for months. Let's see:  Purity tests - check  Conspiracy theories - check  Intentional spreading of false information - check  Dunning-Kruger Syndrome - check  Cult-like devotion - check  Gaslighting - check  Confirmation bias - check  Did I miss anything?
100% both of them support white supremacy and affordable healthcare. Very true!
Dude's been in Congress longer than I've been alive but he's not the establishment yet apparently Pete Buttigieg is an establishment insider...
Bernie's worldview is odd.  Biden is the establishment, Obama isn't, but Pete Buttigieg also is... it makes no internal sense whatsoever.
Absolutely hilarious how Obama isn't "establishment" yet Obama's vice president is. OK, Bernie.
That's always the snag that Bernie Bros hit in their argument. They can talk about the billionaires and corporate interests but at the end of the day this is all decided by the votes cast of regular people and those votes are why Biden is winning this primary and looks pretty well on track to continue winning it.
I wish I could find it right now but there was a great clip floating around a while back of Whoopi Goldberg going in *hard* on a defence of Biden and the 'establishment' against the accusation that they're irrelevant and uninspiring and never help anyone.
Not to mention both groups will vote for trump to "send a message" to people they dislike
I prefer to think of myself as the Democratic Elite.
[deleted]
Sanders deputy campaign chair was on CNN defending their gaslighting Obama ad by getting argumentative and demanding the host to deny they weren't Obama's words. This tactic is from Kellyanne Conway's playbook. I hear his surrogates constantly insisting that only Bernie and those who support his 2020 versions of policies care about their fellow Americans, just like Trump sycophants think that only his policies can make America great again. To their respective supporters, it's more about the person than the policies or the ability to actually get anything implemented in the next 4 years.
I do hope you are this diligent in your policing of the tones of other Sanders supporters, for example the ones pushing the lie that Joe Biden has dementia.
Agree with you completely. A lot of people try to divide and create the impression that there is a huge divide between Biden and Sanders. A strong public option can eventually become M4A. Biden is also for free community college (albeit 2 years instead of 4). I've even heard on these boards someone suggesting that Sanders and AOC should create their own party. Nonsense. We are all democrats (even though we may not agree on everything) and we won't defeat Donald Trump if we are not united.
I agree completely as a Biden supporter. I think a lot of people are sick of being called “Basically republicans” by a large share of Bernie supporters.  We see comparisons between rhetoric used by Bernie supporters and Trump supporters. “Anti establishment, the system is out to get us and your the system” kind of rhetoric. But that’s not all Bernie supporters and that IS a narrative Trump is pushing.   So we really do need to dismiss that shit and work together. Whether your candidate wins, or mine, we are both working towards the same big picture goals. So let’s shape the narrative and kick Trump’s ass
It’s not like you guys got off your butts to vote for Bernie in the primary.
Whether or not you choose to stay home is entirely up to you. My toddlers also throw tantrums when they don’t get their way and often lose out because of it. You’re no different.  Calling Sanders supporters cultists is not productive. But neither is Sanders supporters calling Elizabeth Warren a snake, accusing her supporters of “voting with their vaginas,” suggesting that Buttigieg somehow cheated in the Iowa caucuses, or generalizing all Biden supporters as “the corporate establishment.”  Sanders needs to stop casting aspersions and stones. We’ve already got one asshole in national politics who would rather divide us than unite us. And that’s the core problem with Sanders: he seems more willing to divide us (“Clyburn’s politics are not my politics; Joe is a corporate shill”) for his pursuit of ideological purity.
Stay home then.  We don't bow to terrorist.  Look at the state of S4P sub.  Its so cult like
If the shoe fits then lace that shit up and wear it. If you can’t handle legitimate criticism of your candidate then you’re in a cult.
Not like you're not going to do that anyway.
If Bernie supporters don't want to be called cultists, they need to stop acting like they're in a cult.  Swearing that your candidate is the "only" one who can win and the "only" one who supports this and that, and then ignoring any fair criticism while attacking the ones who make it is pretty much the same thing cult members do to defend their cult gurus.
Dude. What he said about AIPAC being a platform for bigotry was extremely fucked up, flippant, and out-of-touch.
Someone else mentioned this, but both Trump's and Sander's campaigns are underscored by anger and discontent. They both tout being "outsiders" who will clean up Washington, and that approach is earnestly not something new (Ted Cruz does the same thing, and the Republican party hates him)  The reason why Ronald Reagan's and Obama's legacies are so positively viewed by their respective parties is because they have always been known as people's-persons.  Whether you agree with their policies or not, both Obama and Reagan have been considered like-able and personable, and at the end of the day you still have to work with your enemies to get things done.
Trump just listened to Fox News and regurgitated whatever they said.  That IS the GOP, so they loved it.
Right?
Let's say your landlord, who is also getting a UBI, decides to raise the rent because he knows you now have more a month. You have three choices. 1) roll over n get robbed n pay. 2) move 3) sue for price fixing and/or extorsion. The idea is that most landlords wont do this. They will continue with business as usual because rates are dependant on the competitive local market, not on a specific unit owned by a landlord. Landlords who guoge will find themselves tenantless because they now have the money to relocate or fight. The fundamental principle is called bottom up capitalism. Its described in Yang's book at length. Its an easy read and I recommend it.
Yeah the violence against women act was a real establishment regressive move on his part. Imagine believing this LOL  Really great outreach program by the way. This is why Sanders has no friends.
[removed]
What would you think if he ran third party, there are hints that he is possibly think of that. The fund raising emails hint that he’s not going to roll over.
After 38 years of voting as a Republican, I just voted as a Democrat in a primary. Don't let me down, Joe!
Honestly, I've always been a moderate Republican. I was proud of my very conservative wife walking into early voting staffed by her friends and asking for a Democratic ballot.
Nice. He won’t.
Welcome to the coalition, friend!
Thank you!   It’s inspiring to see   The ability to change your mind is a superpower
Same here. Or in any case I’m ideologically conservative. In the future I’ll probably vote for moderate Democrats and Republicans (if available) on a case by case basis.   This time, however, I’m very excited to have a moderate Democrat to vote for. I also would have voted for Mayor Pete or Klobuchar. But Joe was always my first choice and I’m glad he seems to be on track to be the nominee.
Another Republican here who will be voting for Joe, how exactly did we end up with this president again?  Frankly it's embarrassing.
May your name be Legion!
Thank you and welcome!
Excellent!
Very interesting. Thanks for sharing.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎
I’m a progressive for Joe! Let’s build that winning coalition and get Trump out!
My dad is in the same boat as you. Let’s all win together.
Voted Republican until after 2016 and know consider myself a moderate Democrat. This will be my first time voting for a Democrat as president of too!
 But what're your current thoughts for November? Those can change, but that would matter
Welcome! Glad to have you in the coalition.
Happy to have you on board!
Feels good, don't it?
People who are rational Americans realize that Joe will be better for everybody whether Republican or Democrat, and for America as a whole.   Republicans are brainwashed to think they are better off with another four years.  Man, if they get what they are asking for they are going to regret it!
Welcome home
Awesome and thank you!!
Big tent 🤗🤗🤗
Only with Joe can we get a White House free of Malarkey!
Heck yeah! Gonna make that coalition that will actual election a candidate instead of bernies crapshoot
democrat.
This is why we need Joe!  You (and others like you) are exactly the type of person we need to win the general!  Thank you so much!
Thank you
Good on ya friend   I'm a moderate Democrat who has crossed party lines in previous elections.   Us moderate who care about character and decency need to stick together.   Country over party forever
Lesser of two evils. I’m with it.

What made you change your mind?
I really appreciate you. I’ve always been a Democrat, although moderate, and was essentially raised to not like Republicans despite growing up in the middle of Kansas. However if there is one positive thing that I can take from Trump being president it’s that I have grown to respect the hell out of conservatives who have stayed true to their values, and not fallen in line with Trump’s bullshit. It’s helped me grow out of the red vs blue mindset and to realize that things just aren’t that simple. I can respect anybody who is open-minded enough to know when their party has gone too far. Welcome aboard.
I am curious, I have seen lots of disillusioned Bernie voters claiming they have very real and not made up conservative friends and family members who said they will vote Bernie over Biden, what's your take on this?
Welcome to the coalition! We’re glad to have you
I think there is hope, I have a number of conservative friends who could vote for Biden, but not Sanders. Then there is my dad, he was a Trump donor and now is an outspoken critic.
Talk about damning with faint praise...
You don’t see a difference between Biden and trump???
The Bernie Bros haven’t even subsided yet and already the Trump trolls are invading?
We all need to do whatever we can to keep Trump from getting reelected. Even though we personally benefited from Trump's financial policies (until last week), we cannot vote for him. He is a terrible human being.
I would also like to hear more about your decision.
Bernie and Trump are one in the same. Only difference is you would not have the financial tax advantages and families will make even less than they are now for the “free” incentives.
Where do you think your father's change of heart is coming from?
You’re right, there’s a time and a place and this isn’t it.
Glad to see you willing to cross the lines.  I’m also still not convinced that the (up until recently) success of the stock market has as much to do with Trump as it does the foundation Obama laid down combined with institutional inertia that’s resisted Trump’s best efforts to screw stuff up (such as his constant efforts to start a trade war with China).
But people knew he was a terrible human being in November 2016.
Its far more than just trump thats wrong with the republican party tho.
I have a conservative uncle with the same sentiments. People like you are more hell bent on getting Trump out of office than anyone else.
[removed]
See my last sentence above.
He is very anti-racist, now anti-Trump and anti-Republican. Read my story about him 😀.
We did and didn't vote for him.
We new in general terms that he was awful. We now know just how specifically awful he is as a President.
My hope is that while conservatives then knew he was a terrible human being,  they now realize he is also a terrible president.
Not generally true.
I also will not support any Republican that supports or will not renounce Trump.
I never said I did and I didn't vote for him.
Oops sorry, I commented at the same time as you! Well good for you for keeping an open mind. Hopefully many will follow your example.
Where to read?
Oh yes they did. If you were still with Trump after the Mexican Rapists speech you knew damn well what he was about.
Its definitely a step in the right direction, and i applaud your being open enough to change. Can i ask what you make of mcconnel and other republican leadership? Not including their support of trump
Oh I thought you did, because your title says you voted Republican for 38 years.
Alright, there are plenty valid criticisms of Trump, but that one was such obviously overblown nonsense. It was so clear that he was saying “their rapists” not “they’re rapists.” Anyone who says otherwise was looking for reasons to hate him that they no longer have to make up.
Eh I'd wager the majority of voters didn't actually see that speech.
Zero respect for all of them.
Voting as a Republican, but not strictly...I voted Libertarian in 16'.
I respect you for coming over to the side of reason. It gives me great hope to know that there are republicans who can see Trump and company for who they really are. I welcome you to the Biden coalition with open arms. 😊
How do we know that you aren't a plant, a la Alvin Greene?
538 updated their forecast.. Wow.
At least bernies supporters can proudly say:  “no one” is more popular than Bernie.
Don’t get complacent that forecast can go down also.
I actually had to check the real 538 page to see if this was real or a meme.  Holy fuck.
**JOEMENTUM**
BE NICE TO OTHER CANDIDATES' SUPPORTERS  We're about unity, and we're not going to become a news headline. Treat them like human beings.
94% chance of getting a plurality as well.  Biden is the presumptive nominee at this point barring something major like a heart attack.  ...actually, considering events earlier in this cycle that doesn't seem to count as something major.  The hopeful part of me thinks Sanders will drop out after Flordia to unite the party, but the realistic part of me that backed Biden because Sanders can't unify people isn't sure that will be the case :/
It’s over Bernie, we have the high ground.
Lol at No One...
That's still a 1 in 8 chance of malarkey! Let's not be too passive.
Yikes. It was Bernie's primary to lose, and he looks like he did everything in his power to make sure his chances are as low as possible.
Reddit is going to like this! Hopefully they don’t quarantine this place soon after this post!
💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊🐊!!!
make sure to vote!
I thought this was just another repost of that meme
This comes paired witha  94% plurality chance. In that 10% "no one" case, Pete's, Amy's, and maybe Warren's delegates should be able to bridge the gap.  EDIT: oh, and Mike
Accompanying article: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/after-super-tuesday-joe-biden-is-a-clear-favorite-to-win-the-nomination/  > So basically, Sanders has to come back quickly when the momentum is currently against him in a bunch of states that are not very good for him — or it will be too late. It’s not impossible. But the chances are low. The model gives Biden an 88 percent chance of winning a majority of pledged delegates, with most of the remaining outcomes being “no majority” rather than a Sanders majority. It also gives Biden a 94 percent chance of winning a plurality of pledged delegates, and Sanders a 6 percent chance.
Don't discount GOP/Russian ratf\*ckery.
Let no one claim that Gabbard isn't providing a useful role for this Primary— notice how she makes the x-axis nice and black in the graph. I don't see any other candidate highlighting the x-axis for us as well as she is!
Don't get complacent, Michigan is a must win.
Injecting this straight into my viens 💎🎩🐊👌
[deleted]
as a bernie supporter who is rooting for biden's victory over trump if he gets the nomination--please be kind to bernie supporters. we're in this together.
Talk about the comeback kid!
So the Malarkey Bus was correct? We are taking off? ZOOOOOMMMMMMMM TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!!!!
Vote, donate and volunteer. Things are looking good but we are not done fighting until we beat Donald Tump.
Tulsi's chances are holding nice and steady.
Mmmmm yes, that's some good ice cream.
unless bernie can win Michigan, this is practically over
COMEBACK KID
It was pretty clear that Bernie had hit his ceiling, which was pretty low, then picked up some soft support when Biden started falling.  But Democrats have unified behind Biden and Bernie now has no chance.
This is why I hate all of the false hope articles about Sanders turning things around. I wish that could happen but it ain't gonna happen. There are a ton of big states coming up in the next 10 days and Biden is going to win all of them. The sooner Sanders supporters accept that Biden has bested him(I'm still unsure how but such is life) the easier the transition to the general will be.
As a statistician...  It's hard for me to place much predictive value on any model with swings this wild. Biden is the front runner, and it might even be 88%, but I think even Nate would concede that it has massive error bars around it. A week ago everyone was freaking out because it looked like Bernie was coasting to a win. If Bernie pulls off an upset in Michigan (like he did in 2016) and Missouri (where a post-Super Tuesday poll had him down only 4 points), the model will swing back again.  I highly encourage people to act the way we did the day before Super Tuesday - keep donating and volunteering if you can.
JOEMENTUM
Just got back from casting my vote for Joe here in Michigan.  Was in and out of the City Clerk office in about 10 minutes.
They did list a lot of variables and unknowns though.  No time to get complacent.
I'll be right back, I need to see what TYT is like today
Something tells me politics subreddit would not like this news one bit.
BE GRACIOUS WINNERS  I'm saying this for myself as much as my fellow Diamond Joe supporters, but now is the time to take a deep breath before dunking on Sanders supporters. Now is the time to unite.
We need to work hard to get a good result on Tuesday. IF we get that result, we need to put the pressure on Bernie to concede. If the math doesn't work for any candidate, the tradition of conceding should be followed.  We don't need any more of that bush league egocentric running until the end and hurting our chances to win in November.
Now isn’t the time to get complacent. Yeah this forecast looks good but it’s predicated on people getting out to VOTE. Just because it looks like Joe is gonna win doesn’t mean you can skip voting. Remember what happened in 2016. Go vote!
What a difference a week makes, especially since one week ago, I was out campaigning door to door for Pete here in South Carolina. Thankfully our local Biden Bunch invited me under their wings- their supporters were super welcoming.  I'm not quite sure where "no one" fits into this picture though? Contested convention I guess?
Gabbard: “so you’re saying I have a chance!”
Damn
You say you want a revolution Well, you know We all want to change the world You tell me that it's evolution Well, you know We all want to change the world But when you talk about destruction Don't you know that you can count me out Don't you know it's gonna be All right, all right, all right You say you got a real solution Well, you know We'd all love to see the plan You ask me for a contribution Well, you know We're doing what we can But if you want money for people with minds that hate All I can tell is brother you have to wait Don't you know it's gonna be All right, all right, all right You say you'll change the constitution Well, you know We all want to change your head You tell me it's the institution Well, you know You better free you mind instead But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow Don't you know it's gonna be All right, all right, all right All right, all right, all right All right, all right, all right All right, all right
>That deficit could get worse because there are some signs that late-returned mail ballots in California will help Biden.  When does CA and the rest of the ST states release/certify final results?  Really hoping we're not looking at a month wait like with Iowa.
Diamond Joe rides again!
We were always the majority. We were just gorged with good options. Dont mistake that for leading at 30% as leading in general.
LETS GO
NYT still refuses to update their forecast
Remember that things go up and down fast, Joe was ahead before the first state and then dropped hard after the first state. Then after SC he went back up, it could always swing down again.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎💎💎💎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Let’s. Fucking. GOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
This is exciting.
and I wouldn’t be shocked if they massaged the algorithm a bit to be more favorable to Bernie
does this mean no Giant Meteor 20202?
Some VP once said “This is a big fucking deal.” and a hot mic picked it up. I wonder how that VP views this projection.
Holy shit I’ve never seen a swing that big since my wife dated that one dude
Should these guys really be taken seriously after how bad they botched super Tuesday?
Remember when 538 gave Hillary a 71% chance of winning?

Badum tssssh

And "no one" is less popular than Biden. I think I understand how Bernie math works now!
Oof, apply Obamacare directly to the bern!
LMAOOOOO

Bad joke bad joke. Go put on your dad hat and sit in the corner.

It's also important we get Bernie to drop out as quick as possible so we can pivot to the general. That means we need to crush him in votes in upcoming states ASAP
[Absolutely. It ain't over 'till it's over.](http://i.imgur.com/SXbrpvY.gif).   I'm not truly celebrating until I see Trump lose on November 3rd.
Donating another 25 right now
Never get complacent. Too many cases to cite
To your point, some of these forecasts gave Clinton about a 99.9% chance to win on election night.
Same. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.  These past few days have been freaking nuts.
Many people are still in grief. It's been a crazy few days.
> barring something major like a heart attack.  I mean that didn't stop Bernie at the time
Idk that he'd drop out after FL considering he has to already know now he'll lose it.
> Biden is the presumptive nominee at this point barring something major like a heart attack.  He's the likely nominee. I think "presumptive" nominee is reserved for someone who has won the majority of delegates but not become the official nominee yet. Basically the nominee elect before the convention makes it official.
I think his odds will go down to <1% after Michigan (March 10th), in which he'll start getting real pressure to drop out.   On March 17th after the Florida wipeout, I think he'll actually do it.
well staying in to get political concessions isn't the end of the world
The only thing I'm kinda worried about is the coronavirus (older people not going to vote and that benefitting Bernie). It could be a black swan.  Edit: I obviously hope I am wrong. Playing devil's advocate here.
Or a third brain aneurysm might do it. Actually, anything can happen at this point, any three of the contestants could drop dead.
Berners: You underestimate my power! Aaaargh!  Biden: *chop chop*
Would you say Biden has.... *high* hopes?
An upset, to be sure, but a welcome one
No one was winning 3 days ago
1 in 15.  Plurality is a win according to Sanders himself.  Still, that's something.  Joe himself was in the single digits in the forecast at one point (though it's worth pointing out *never* as low as 6%).
When you become the Democratic party front runner you should probably avoid the "We're going to destroy the democratic party" rhetoric.
Reddit will back Biden once it's obvious Bernie has no path to victory.
Lmao it's basically the same just without the bus!
I was just thinking that even after Bernie was out in 2016. They went hard after Hillary on here. Remember pizzagate!
Oh yeah, I'm sure Barr is already hard at work "discovering" new evidence about Hunter and Burisma.  It's gonna get ugly.
I can direct you to the closest needle exchange. Be safe.
Maybe we can find out from the Republicans in 2024.
Much as people (myself included) have gotten annoyed this cycle, we are all on the same team.  Let's get this spray-tanned disgrace outta our White House.
[removed]
Remindme! 10 days
Right? It's nice to look at but I think it may look a little better for Sanders after Tuesday.
If Sanders pulls an upset today CONGRATULATE him and his supporters.
This times 100! We're all on the same side, and we're all going to need to come together to beat Trump. Regardless of their past transgressions, lets invite people in and show them what Joementum is all about.
ROTR. 🤝
Agreed! 🙂
And conversely - if Bernie is mathematically out after tonight - do not gloat, do not harass them, do not go on their subs.... They believe in Bernie and his message.  Let’s let them process this loss if/when that time comes.
YOu know what is CRAZY the exit poll in Missouri. I dont have the exact numbers but most people there would trust Biden in an emergency over sanders, but most WANT medicare for all, to me this shows some of Bernies ideas resonates with voters just not Bernie himself, at least in missouri
Bernie supporter here.  Thank you for this post.  Regardless of the result, our goals are far more similar than what the GOP holds, and we need to end Trump's Presidency.  Good luck tonight and let's win in Nov.
The best I can give them is silence, sorry.
Thanks for this.
Exactly why we are winning!
If you have nothing nice to say, just don't say it!
Leave them be. If they come here say hi.   Give them space.
This is How you beat Trump. So tired of being emotionally dragged around by seeing democrats eating themselves.
Bernie supporter here.     I'm sad for my boy, but I'm on board with Joe to get the piece of garbage out of the White House.  I appreciate the kind message.       That being said, I will freely admit that many of my Bernie brethren are riding the "DNC rigged the primaries hurrdurr" theory.  If we want Joe to win in November, we need to bring at least some of them over.  Please continue the kindness; it's probably the best way to get some to see the light.
This makes me feel good. As a Warren...now Sanders supporter, I see the writing on the wall and appreciate that if Joe wins, his supporters will welcome us progressives with open arms. Let's win in November.
Let's end the toxicity.   They wouldn't do that to us if (when) the situation is reversed but turn the other cheek.   Progressive ideas should be welcomed, and together we can win in November.
Bernie Sanders supporter here.  Thank you for this post.  No matter what other Bernie supporters say, I will respect Joe Biden and his supporters.
This is how we win.  ❤️❤️❤️
Sanders supporter here. Pretty sure we're fucked in the general now - but you have my vote regardless when we get there.  Yolo.
Looks like you guys dont have to worry about that :P  But its nice seeing how civil it is here. pol is a toxic cespool of temper tantrums right now.  grats on the wins guys
You're good people. As someone from outside the US, I see the toxicity that's hurled at Biden supporters (and really anyone who doesn't support Bernie) and I can't imagine extending an olive branch like that. But that shows the character of the supporter that Joe Biden attracts.
Agreed! We need unity.
Agreed. In the end we are all going to have to get together and support whoever the nominee is, even if Sanders. Best to treat each other with respect and only make criticism that is in good-faith.
Pete’s rules of the road
Narrator- "He didn't"
Bernie supporter + staffer here! Thanks so much for this. I’m really hoping Joe himself can become a little more welcoming to the progressive wing of the party in his messaging if he wins. It really disappointed me to see him on TV saying he’d veto M4A if it passed the house and the senate, and that he knew there weren’t weapons of destruction in Iraq from the beginning but voted for it anyway. I hope (if he wins) that you guys, his base, can help to gently encourage him not to ignore us. We saw how trying to win against Trump while shunning the left went for Hillary and I know no one wants to live in Trump’s America any longer than we have to.   And before you have to say it- rest assured, I am fully intending to vote blue no matter who + encourage as many people as I possibly can to do the same. The issue with shunning the left though is that you’re also going to lose a lot of enthusiasm from the youth and people that are non/ semi voters because they’re under the impression that their vote doesn’t count. I work for Bernie as a campus organizer and I’m telling ya, most people under the age of 25 are absolutely under this impression. This is why it’s such a volatile voting block, in my opinion. Biden will need to try to do some appeals to them that are more than just “back to normal,” because “normal” for most 20-somethings has meant a lifelong procession of war, recession, crushing debt, low wages and then Trump takeover.    Hope we can work together at the end of it all. Good luck tonight.
Biden has won. It's time to go to Joe.
> This is going to be a fantastic night for us and even with a major upset the door is closing on Bernie, a little kindness can't hurt.  Kindness is the way to go! Remember, Bernie and his supporters are NOT your enemies. They are just different regiment fighting against same enemy. And at one point, all regiments has to unite in order to defeat our common enemy. That time might be now. And how can you get other regiments to follow you and help you? Be kind, supporting, welcoming and overall positive towards them!  And also passivity. I can't stress this enough. This is no time to hunt for Bernie's supporters. It is time to welcome those who DECIDE to join us. Be welcoming to them, be supportive, but the time to lead active campaign is over. Now it's time to welcome those who decide to join us!
Sanders supporter here, this is very appreciated but it looks like Biden has the night. Can't wait for Sunday's debate! I really want to see Joe shine at this one as he may be going against Trump soon enough. I just pray if he gets the primary that he has it in him to debate and not stumble. Just being honest, the way he's been acting and stumbling the past month has me concerned about his stress level and stability.
As a Bernie supporter who is ready to vote for joe, thank you for this, let’s all come together
Ok let's see if yall can actually do it. I voted for Bernie and I hope he wins. I am absolutely antagonizing you, mainly because I want to see if you really are more civil than me and if you really mean what you're saying. Frankly, Biden is a strong candidate and I respect you for supporting him. I just think Bernie is a better choice. Good luck tonight.
100%
Bernie supporter here, folding into Bernie like we expected Biden and warren supporters to do if Sanders won. We don't have time to hold grudges, we all want the same thing to defeat trumpism and remove fascism from America!!
Wait, you mean I shouldn't suggest he is a mentally compromised corporate shill?  I thought that was what we were doing now...    I guess I'll put all those memes away and act like a reasonable human being.

LOOKS LIKE THATS NOT HAPPENING 🐊🐊🐊🐊
I can't help but admire this
the hates so silly  Im in az, voted bernie 2016, voted (early) bernie 2020 , originally supported mayor pete (actually moved back to bernie the night before iowa)  Joe "empathetic, decent as hell, lifetime of service" biden? , no question i'm on board.  My values might be a smidge more left than center left but most bernie supporters are pragmatic, donald frickin trump is the president people. Bigger fish to fry
I will congratulate, but I will not support.
No.  I just won't say anything about it.
they have the worse reddit so i wont be congratulating subreddit. they banned me for no reason.
I will!
Honestly... today’s results have been devastating to so many people.  Hopes for healthcare and a new deal died today.  It feels so hopeless when your own party just continues allowing millions to die.
I fully expect upsets in MI and WA, but even if it's a clean sweep, hell yes, leave the toxicity to them.
This sub is night and day with some of the other political subs I see. Keep it classy. It's how we will win in 2020.
I like the idea, but I wholeheartedly apologise, I’m not going to pretend his followers have not been absolute dicks. Fuck woke bros for shitting on Pete for being “too gay” or “not gay enough.” I’m done with this round- version 2.0. Maybe LGBT voters are few and far in between, but I’m done being degraded by people telling minorities that they have our best interests at heart. No, I know my interests. I won’t vote for Bernie, I’ll write in before I play any role in ushering in a toxic man who attracts toxic supporters.
I will just not make fun of them, but I don't feel like I can congratulate them. Their campaign was pretty dirty.
Tell them to git gud.
As the Lacedaemonian once said... "If"
[removed]
Like hell will I congratulate them.  Will I do what they do when they lose?  No.  But I wont congratulate them.
>will have to come around too      No. I'm done voting for the lesser of two evils. I'll vote in any election in which there is a non-corrupt candidate who gives a shit about the working class. That is sure as fuck not Joe Biden.
[removed]
For what?  8 to 12 years shitty healthcare?
I really did appreciate the movement to the left on a lot of issues that he brought to the party. I hope people realize that it made the change he wanted come much faster than it would have before. Bernie was a good guy, I just don't want him to be president.
I was just browsing both subs. It is weird the sanders sub is 50 times bigger than Biden’s.   While browsing the Bernie sub, I saw a lot of people that feel it was rigged. And they won’t vote for Biden.   It’s a bit crazy that they would rather just protest and let Coronavirus expert Trump have a second term.   Is Joe perfect? Fuck no. But if Joe wins. Sanity comes back. Experts that were cast off will return like the Riders of Rohan in LoTR. They are loyal to government. The experts who would have been on top of this pandemic will return I hope.   I hope there is a role for Obama. Maybe he has some things he didn’t achieve that he wants to finish. I don’t think Joe’s ego is so big that he wouldn’t let Obama back in.   Uncle Joe messes up when he speaks. Not nearly as much as Trump. But man, he is a decent man. He has admitted to some of his mistakes.   The extreme side of the Democratic Party just can’t seem to realize twitter and Reddit do not represent the typical Dem. Most don’t respond well to crazy. They claim it’s passion, great. But every good presenter knows it’s important to read their audience. And no one likes being talked to like we are dumb just because we don’t agree with free everything. That arrogance pissed off Trump voters. Haven’t they learned?  Anyway, it looks like it’s going Joe’s way. Good luck in November!
It’s 50/50 at any given moment that you’re interacting with a russian   I’m going to wait until the primary is over before I begin engaging Bernies supporters and try to encourage them to rejoin the party
Seconded!
[Always.](https://giphy.com/gifs/harry-potter-alan-rickman-6RIEW15CCWRvq)
Bernies not going to drop out before the debate, but I hope today and next Tuesday are so strongly for Biden that he decides not to drag this out any longer.
Yes. There are already complaints about Biden people in their threads, let’s not be obnoxious.
Thanks for the fellow feeling, /u/JaneSmithAgain. This is a lot to process for me.
Bring this post to the top.
Bernie is the worst advocate for his ideas. I wish he would have seen that in 2016. It would have made this primary cycle much healthier and interesting.
The idea of universal health care is a huge winner and has polled exceptionally well (in all states) for decades... even before Sanders started making headlines with his version, M4A.  Even in 1993 (almost 30 years ago, shit) Hilary proposed a bill that would provide a "health care security card" to every citizen, entitling them to medical treatment and preventative services, etc.  In the end, guess what?  They had to compromise. The problem has always been our friends to the right, the real right, who we need be smart against to get closer to the vision.  This is why Obamacare (Affordable Care Act), even in its final stripped down version, was basically a miracle to pass - it's a long game, not a short one.
Can you link this exit poll? I don’t see any out yet
If someone said they would offer F4A  (Food for All) that would poll well to.  Offering free stuff that you have zero ability deliver is cheating.
In some other polls though (not the one you're referring to) people had similar opinions about M4A, but a public option was even MORE popular. Basically, every Democrat wants to make public healthcare a thing, they'd be happy with M4A, but they'd be even happier with a public option.
I'm not an US citizen. Just interested in politics. I have no access to US news channels. Could you please send me link to exist polls?
I don’t think any American thinks our health care system is where it needs to be. We just completely disagree on how to fix it.
Either candidate would be an improvement to the current administration and I will support whoever the nominee is.
Good enough! You're staying civil lol.
Same here. I’ll talk my shit about them on enough sanders spam but I will not go harass them on their subs or threads.
Same on my end. The vocal Sanders base is horrific, to say the least. I may not hate Bernie and agree with some of his policies, but his base attacks any other candidate and their supporters, makes up excuse after excuse about the DNC or MSNBC or anything else imaginable as to how Bernie's not in the lead, and I wouldn't be surprised if Biden wins the nomination and a lot of them simply don't vote for him out of spite. I have no desire to congratulate any of them.  Edit: Made the mistake of looking more on twitter and it's just absurd. They're saying Biden can't beat Trump so instead of voting for Biden, they just aren't going to vote. They're fine handing the win to Trump by not voting and then they're just going to blame Biden for not being electable even though they're the ones that didn't vote. It's simply deplorable.
[removed]
You're winning because you have the whole corrupt DNC behind you. It's corruption and illegitimacy was exposed in 2016, and I'm sure it will be exposed again.
Joe wasn't my first choice for sure. But I feel really good how almost every other candidate, many of which I respect very much, are speaking to his empathy and respect for different voices in the party. I used to think Joe's push for unity was just talk but not anymore.
Please welcome us Bernie supporters. My younger and more virulent cohorts need to have their energy directed by getting them excited about things that will radically improve their lives. It's easy for me at 35 to do the right thing and vote for joe, but the younger ones need to get jazzed to show up and they don't have the experience to understand the consequences of their inaction. I am really looking forward to seeing how the biden campaign works to attract bernie's movement by including him and his platform.
Just being honest. This stresses me out too. Joe is not a great debater although that hasn't seemed to matter much so far.
🤛 respect.
Yes, we can!
Of course!  All my respect.
Lib
Every subreddit does that to supporters of other candidates
I hear you, I'm far more progressive than Joe. I want some form of a public option as soon as possible. I **need** our country to become carbon neuteral as soon as possible.  The hope I can give and I hope this ensures at least some sense of comfort is that to me this is very much a "passing the torch" presidency. Joe wants to put the best advocates in different parts of his government. Like Beto on guns which was his most liberal stance by far. I think Biden isn't daft to the complacency that led to Trump and will likely spend four years pulling our country back together before passing to torch to a new generation.
Always nice 2 be nice dawg.
Trump is literally waiting for RBG to die so he can take away abortion rights. It's between evil and and non evil. That's the truth of it.  This November: DO NOT give into selfishness. Vote like your little cousin is stuck  in a cage at the border.
Please don't hand Trump the keys a second time. I was prepared to back Sanders when he had a big lead.
Alien voice: “I come in peace.” End alien voice. I am from Vermont and grew up with Bernie my whole life. Love him to pieces. Came to this Reddit to see what Biden’s supporters are all about. Right now, it’s easy for someone to say they “won’t” vote for Biden because they are frustrated right now. Just keep in mind true Sanders supporters will come around. I voted for Hillary last time because Sanders told me to. I think many Sanders supporters fear that 2016 is repeating itself, but there’s not much we can do about it except vote Blue even if it’s not our first choice candidate.
Not a bad idea. Give people space to think about their choices and then approach them.
Problem is that it’s an echo chamber, mate, and the Russians need only yell something into it before every real Bernie bro is repeating it and acting as if it’s true.  Going to be hard to break them of that, and engaging after Bernie loses the nom is only going to be *much* harder. Russians will be **screaming** into the echo chamber all sorts of shit, just like they did in 2016.  The sad part is that Bernie Bros seem to think the Russians (or rather, the russian operation) are just being mean to other people – and then trying to argue they’re the only ones being mean – as if the goal was to turn people against Sanders and his supporters and thus sow division.  That isn’t the point.  The point is to get real people to act like the “bots” (Sybil, or sock puppet, would be the more accurate term, but whatever), to make them think “everyone thinks like this” and to drive them to conforming with antisocial behavior.  *That* is the point.  So many of them seem to miss that, though, and it’s frustrating.
Energizing the African American base would be energy better spent IMO. If enough had turned out for Hillary she wins. We need them motivated this year. They sure as Hell wouldn't turn out for Bernie.
Why do you think Russian want Bernie to win? Bernie would be really bad for Putin
Lmfao, you're here accusing bernie supporters of being Russian assets, and somehow the media narrative is that sanders supporters are the toxic ones. How does anyone buy this?
Maybe not - but hopefully he changes his tone and stops attacking Joe if he sees the writing on the wall.
Maddow, msnbc, stating that Sen. Sanders will step aside gracefully and join in defeating the clown and court ( Senate ). At least from what she gleaned from her interview apparently. Which sounds about right since we’re all on the same side.
I think 2016 was a decent opportunity for Bernie to be just wild enough to give attention to issues we weren't paying enough attention too. So 20' had lots of great candidates who wanted to move the party left without being devisive and bitter towards the coalition we need to win. But he tried to make them all seem like evil Republican shills and now progress on all his best ideas are slowed because he has no idea how to work with people and get shit done.
This is why I was a Warren voter.  I spent years in M4A advocacy, and Warren was the only candidate with an M4A plan, a vision, and the temperament to make it happen.  I hate that so much malarkey has become a major distraction from the issue that makes Bernie’s platform so attractive to the millions of people voting for him.  He’s hardly a natural politician, but he’s a good man and he’s been on the right side of history long before it was popular.  Joe’s both a good man and a natural politician, but he’s been wrong on a lot of issues.  Neither are perfect, both come with a lot of baggage, and it’s easy to see why they’re the ones left standing.  Looking forward to having our nominee so we can take it to the conservatives.
yep, he should have endorsed Warren.  Or at least not lie about saying, yes, in America it's going to be difficult to elect a woman president.
You go to too many crowds and you start to believe their cheers.
Reminder: Regardless of how tonight's results go, do not go into other candidate's subreddits to troll or demand they drop out
Rules of the road!  * \#1 is Respect
Went into that political sub, arrr politics, with a positive message showcasing support of Joe  Was promptly downvoted, insulated, and now getting PMs trying to doxx me   Wew lad ...they mad y'all
Bernie guy here, congrats on the hard work and the likely nomination for your guy- enjoy the night!
Yo I love that you guys are so respectful. Yang supporter here and this was one of the goals of our subreddit too.   So nice to see this in contrast with the Bernie Bros
Remember how we've all felt! There are people that have come from multiple different campaigns. We win when we are graceful. If they come welcome them in and lift them up with us all. We need every single person we can gather into this coalition. ROTR should apply they are an awesome path to decency and an end to malarkey for us all. imho
Hey just FYI people in the Warren subreddit are getting messages from some folks here telling us our candidate is weak and we should come join the Joe Biden subreddit. I got one of these messages and I’m already subscribed to this subreddit and already support Joe but it really irked me, can’t imagine it’s helping bring Warren voters over especially with her performance tonight. I have a screenshot but idk about the rules of posting stuff like that here.
I feel at home here seeing #ROTR being deployed here. Thank you for making Team Pete feel more comfortable here.
I was a HRC stan in 2016 and while we tried our best, our two subreddits really fking got into it. It was nasty and the worst and helped no-one.  I don't really see this election being any better, the salt is heavy tonight, but seriously people, do not be negative or snarky, this isn't a safe space and some will wander over here, make sure it is a supportive space and not one that shits all over the thing they've been passionately fighting for for months (or years).   I think we were all vote-blue-no-matter-who before even when Sanders was leading and we have to hope to god they'll stick to it too, but snark certainly won't be motivating and animosity certainly won't help.
Does this include r/politics too 😁
Rule 11: No malarkey
I’m lurking in other subs and like r/Elizabethwarren and they’re saying they’re getting pm’s to join r/joeBiden. Wtf guys. Fucking stop
Hello, Elizabeth Warren supporter here -- I'll be voting for Joe Biden in my state on the 17th, and I won't be sad about it. I'm all in. 💙🇺🇸🌊
Yep, don't stoop to Bernie's supporters levels.  Biden has probably gained a good amount of followers because of their toxicity
Absolutely. Remember,harassing and berating and trolling aren't what were about.
I'm a Warren supporter and tonight was pretty rough for us (even though a lot of us saw it coming). I don't know who I'll be voting for in my primary yet (still a couple months away) but it's nice seeing other candidates subs following the same policies we set. After a week of harassment for continuing to support my candidate it's nice to see!
Former Warren supporter here.  I care most about beating Trump.  That's 10000% the most important thing.  I don't think bernie can beat him.  Jumping on board with Joe.
V important. Gloating will NOT help a Democrat get elected in November and only harm the cause. Patience and understanding will actually help. It's something I'm working on 😬
Be cool tonight. Let the Warren peeps be, this is a hard night for them.   I know it’s hard but, no dunking on the Bros. Be nice. Be like Joe, Pete, Amy and Beto. They all ascribe to the ROTR ideologies.
As a Pete supporter, I'm so delighted to see this sub adopting the ROTR!
So glad to see the ROTR carried out over here! Pete recruit, here. I am sorry that Biden has been given the Bernie Bro treatment. As a Pete supporter, I know all about that and it can really get to you. Just know you have somewhere to go where people respect each other. It is so calming to be in a campaign where you can find peace instead of hate.
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
All I wanna say is r/politics is having an aneurysm rn
Thank you, upvote this into the heavens. The only way to end the cycle of toxicity is if someone chooses not to participate.   Just be chill with each other.
Biden is back in this. Biden will win.
Rules of the road
Funny I agree we stay off of pro-Bro subs. But the idea that r/pol has basically been brigaded to the point where we can’t even post pro-Biden or moderate views? Blerg.
Hey y'all,  Bernie supporter here. Congrats on the victory. Looking forward to a neck and neck race for the primary.  I'm not looking for an argument, just curious to hear why people are voting for Biden? When and if he gets the nomination, and it's Biden vs Trump, I'd like to know who I'm fighting for against Trump!  Thanks!
Trump 2016 voter here ,I would never vote for Bernie but I would consider voting for Biden
Warren supporter here. Thanks for this! Out sub has been slammed with Bernie trolls spewing insults and vitriol. It’s nice to see that some communities aren’t so toxic.
But if Trump dropped out, ya boi’s buying pizza for the whole apartment complex.
Do Bill Weld, Joe Walsh and (checks notes) Zoltan?! Istvan?! have subreddits? If so, I have some questions.
Warren lover, but Bernie strategic voter here. Gonna vote blue no matter who of course. I hope we don't end up in a nasty long primary. Anyway hell of a show guys. Good Biden speech tonight too. Can't wait till our party beats the GOP in November!
Posts like this are only confirming that Pete made the right choice to endorse your guy. Still broken up about him dropping, but Joe’s got my vote!
So, minor bit of positive news. Posters in the Warren sub were saying the guy(s) messaging people last night demanding they switch to Biden turned out to be Trump supporters.
Pete supporters would never do that :)
Tulsi has a sub?  Samoans represent!
Serious question - why is VP Biden attracting so many African american voters? Was he a strong advocate in the past for them? Serious question and I’m hoping someone can elucidate me.
It's also not what Biden's campaign or Biden is about. Practice social safety. We're all on the same team here at the end of the day, we just disagree about how to get to those goals.
We shall not have such malarkey by trolls. Part of restoring the soul of America is grace even in victory.
Too late, plenty of bernie bro's and r/politics comments already.
Wow this is very respectful,the Bernie Bro’s really are some of the most childish disrespectful people on Reddit
Even as someone who supports a different candidate i can really appreciate this subreddit and agree with the things that are said :)
I'm gonna go tell Wayne Messam to drop out; he and Sestak are conspiring to win a brokered convention on the 236th ballot
[removed]
What are Biden’s policy at least top 5? Serious question.
what about r/Bloomberg2020? can we troll that?  Edit: guys I’m kidding I won’t
why?
This is good advice. Let them stew.

Live and breathe it!
Sub-fuckin-scribed
Every "pro-Biden" post gets slammed with replies from Chapo posters. It's fun to play the game where you look at their post history and see if they post on Chapo too. Usually they do. Like how you spot a T\_D poster before you even look.
Well,  have my upvote as a Bernie supporter, and congratulations for Bidens victories so far.   Texas is looking close!
lol at this point, if you're not a huge Bernie fanboy, I reckon you not enter r/politics and post anything.
I did not vote for Joe but I think it’s awful how Biden is being treated on subs. Sanders’ wins in Vermont and Colorado are on the front page but Biden’s are all downvoted. Articles all month about how voters need to support Bernie if he leads going into the convention, and now nothing about ‘voting blue no matter who.’
"arrr politics" is a great idea. Imagine how much better discourse would be if we all spoke like pirates.
Bunker up, buddy.
Strange how little support he gets here when he's kicking the crap outta everyone in most states. Are Reddit's political subs like 99% Cali residents or something?
I was once posting in that sub with a broken keyboard.  Basically the "F" key didn't work.  I got at least one "kill yourself, Trump supporter" PM while posting there even though I wasn't even supporting Trump.  I just didn't have any 'F's in my replies and they took the typos that caused to create an entire backstory for me.
Wew vlad

Hey, thanks, it takes a lot to come say hi like this. Sorry you're having a shitty night.
Thanks. We re doing our best to make sure people don’t bridgade other subs. It doesn’t matter who wins the primary if they don’t beat TRUMP.
Hey man, that's big of you to say, thanks. Sorry you're having a rough time today, and take care of yourselves, this shit can really mess with your head if you let it.
Aw thanks Hymanator00!
You're a good dude. Thanks for the love.
Thank you
Thank you. The only thing that matters after this is defeating Donald Trump.
I mean, it's a little early to say.  Bernie still might get the nomination.  It's pretty close, imo. But overall, it has been really exciting to watch, that's for sure.
[removed]
Same from a Warren voter here. Joe is a good man, and I thank you all for following his example. I suspect he will be our nominee, and I look forward to campaigning for him in the general.
This is what I loved about Yang Gang. I don't know any of y'all IRL but always had wholesome interactions here and on Twitter.  Happy warriors are the best candidates and attract the best people.
Back in the day when the race was like 20 people, I know Team Pete always really liked talking to the Yang Gang, because it felt like we and you guys were the ones who most had our heads in the right place about treating people from other campaigns with respect. Really glad that so many of you are sticking around still fighting the good fight.
I cannot overstate the EXTREME number of Pete supporters who joined up with Biden SPECIFICALLY because the Biden camp was welcoming, was gracious, and didn't hunt them down like a lion going after a wounded gazelle.
Send it via modmail please
If you're someone who has done this, or doesn't see a problem with doing this, you suck. Biden would be ashamed. This is not what his campaign is about. Rules of the Road people.
I'm so sorry you're getting that shit, I've been trying to keep an eye on y'all's sub and chase off anyone who looks like they might be poaching. Please know that we'd be as pissed at them as you are and most of us don't feel that way.  And please accept my sympathies on how your night has been going. The election news is rough enough, but I've seen all the brigading crap you've been getting tonight and so much of it is unbelievably nasty, you shouldn't have to deal with that just because of a fucking vote.
Come on, people..
We will not tolerate that. Please report their usernames and messages to us. The easiest way to contact us is by clicking "Message the moderators" in the sidebar.
Sorry about that. : (  Hope it was just a bunch of trolls, but still that's lame and shouldn't be tolerated. From my end, Elizabeth Warren is a highly intelligent, highly qualified candidate and we are lucky to have her as a politician in our country.
Fellow Pete supporter here! Feeling so welcomed and proud to support Biden.  I felt like Joe himself really represented ROTR today when he pulled back from talking negatively about Sanders in his HQ speech. Really beautiful and amazing stuff.
Also Pete supporter. Just wanted to say hi! #rotr
Team Pete roll call here.  Just stopping by to say I agree whole-heartedly!
It's just a such a good idea, I'm surprised Biden didn't already have something like that
Most of Bernie’s supporters did end up voting for Clinton in the General.  And Bernie ended up campaigning for Clinton.   Right now, they’re angry because the loss is so sudden and the wounds are still raw.  And I expect it might for a few more weeks if Bernie goes negative.  However, I expect that at the end of the day, Sanders will endorse Biden.  And most Sanders supporters will be ok with the result.   But we just have to let them come to terms with it.  Denial and Anger are the first two “Stages of Grief”.  Eventually they’ll get to Acceptance.  We just need to back off and let them work it out.
Yep, stay away from them... They're in A really bad mood.
Rules of the road! Give them space to grieve. It’s what we’d want in their place.
There's so many insane, delusional posts on politics in EVERY THREAD that gets gold so it is at the top and visible... and you read it and you just shake your head at the nonsense.
[deleted]
Probably best just to avoid that sub altogether.  lol
"The DNC is going to alternate young voters of more people support someone other than their champion!"
Don't go there no matter what
r/politics is just a Bernie echo chamber
This philosophy is foundational to all of our explicitly-stated rules, naturally.
Don’t discount the possibility that those could be berners playing games.   The coalition built here have all been on the other end of the loss and been picked clean by bros. I would hope none of us would do that to Liz Supporters.
We don't tolerate that. Please report these incidents to us by sending a message to the moderators. We'll take care of them.
A thousand times this! I started with Harris, then supported Warren, and now am Team Biden.  Supporting Sanders again was never even a consideration with his toxic campaign and supporters.
you guys get such fucking bullshit for literally no reason. for why, because you voted a slightly different flavor of progressive than someone else did? Sound the alarm.  I know it doesn't help much, but god, it's such utter crap, I'm sorry.
I know you've had a rough time of it lately and tonight especially, but you're welcome here. This is a hell of a coalition we're building among the democrat campaigns here.
Yeah. They are melting down in there.
When the Script Doesn't go as Planned...
Not only that, but on r/politics right now some Bernie fans are giving Biden a second look.  Talk about a win-win.
AND...Bernie is the one who had a Heart Attack...
Lmao
The same shit will happen to Trump supporters who are clamoring for a 1-on-1 debate with Biden.
I'm a Bernie supporter but like Biden too.  I don't think anyone really won that debate.  I expected Biden to falter,  but thought he did better than I expected (at least when not having to list off more than 4 talking points). I'm glad Bernie is shifting Biden a bit more progressive which is my biggest hang up with Biden.  I also liked how they're both committed to supporting the nominee and they honestly look like they like each other personally.. just have some fundamental differences in the way they want to achieve the same thing.
O MY 9 SUPER PACS
Bernie looked a little sick tbh.   NO ONE running looks all that good, but they seem rather okay for their ages.
[deleted]
Biden was amazing last night. My kid was for Buttigieg, but he has been quoting Biden all day.
Did this post get linked to by a pro Bernie Discord or something?  There's like 10x the comments all from Sanders supporters trying to concern troll.
... Lose? Sorry, I'm not here to brigade or anything—I'm subbed to this sub because I'm open to the likely possibility of Biden winning the nomination and I feel I should familiarize myself with his policy as a result—but that didn't feel like a win. It wasn't the smackdown Bernie's supporters wanted, not by any means, but it didn't feel like a win for either side. Biden came across as reasonable, if a little sleazy at times, and Bernie came across as Bernie does: revolutionary and angry (though he did seem to try to tone that done a bit). I support Bernie, but I acknowledge that he won't be the nominee barring some extraordinary circumstances. I'll support Biden very, very reluctantly in a general election. Regardless of my position, though, I think calling that debate for anyone would be an extreme call.
I don’t think we need this kind of toxicity rn
nutty idea, between the two, the loser becomes the VP running mate.  now you got both of the popular candidates on the same ticket, uniting the dem party.
It's time to unite the party so whoever wins the Dem nomination gets my vote. Biden is not my first choice. I'm a Pete supporter. But if Bernie wins, he gets my vote. Same for Biden. How can the Dem nominee win the presidency fighting two battles, one within the party and the other against Trump?
I would think winning a debate when all people ask of you is to not "stumble" or wtv is pretty easy.  I'm an european, not gonna vote, my opinion literally has no value but here it is anyway.
Biden: You have 9 superpacts.  Bernie: No I dont.  Biden: You want me to name them?   Bernie: Go ahead.  Biden: Whatever.

How in the world does anybody figure that Biden won that debate? Serious question. The man lied through his teeth.
[removed]
Now I know you guys are delusional.
[removed]
[removed]
Yeah in the debate thread there are many that are refusing to vote in the general and pointing fingers at “moderates.” My head is about to explode...
...are they? There are two Biden hit pieces on the front page, while Bernie gets praise for pivoting to his stump speech and hardly answering corona questions.
/r/politics shouldn’t be considered a serious/objective source for any news considering the influx of unchecked Bernie brigading that consistently goes on—I’ll refer you to Super Tuesday and next to zero mentions of Biden wins. I engage there from time to time to dispel Biden/DNC conspiracy theories/utter fabrications, but outside of that it just can’t be relied on for unbiased information.
I saw #BidenWon trending on Twitter for a while as well.
I was saying this on r/politics just a couple of days ago. Biden is at his best in a 2-person debate
This is hilarious to me. Unless your state didn’t vote yet, fine. Support Bernie.   But if your state voted, the only second look you should have is between trump and Biden.

...and was well enough to campaign 48 hours after being discharged?  [“I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the Presidency,” wrote Martin LeWinter, an attending cardiologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center](https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/12/30/bernie-sanders-releases-medical-history-after-heart-attack.html)
I mean Trump looked bad in every 1 on 1 debate ... so, the smart $ is that trend will continue.
> I'm glad Bernie is shifting Biden a bit more progressive which is my biggest hang up with Biden  It's pretty amazing how left the whole platform has shifted since 2008, and I honestly have to give Bernie some credit for that. $15 minimum wage, college tuition, public option (though this was others issue before). He is definitely having his impact.

I was wondering about all those Super PACs when Joe mentioned them, so I looked it up. Here are some links in case anyone is interested  Joe:  [https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate-outside-spending?id=N00001669](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate-outside-spending?id=N00001669)   Bernie:  [https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate-outside-spending?id=N00000528](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/candidate-outside-spending?id=N00000528)   The largest PAC supporting Bernie has spent about $700K so far. And PACs have spent over $5 Million against Bernie.   For Joe, the largest PAC has spent almost $12 million!, and less than $1 million against.   I am surprised since Joe said yesterday that he was trying to get big money out of poilitics. I understand for the general when Trump folks go full court press, but why against Bernie who for the most part does not have any PAC support.

it was just a meme i came across lol, and as the other guy who replied alluded to, any non-Biden supporter who gets offended or something is almost certainly someone who just isn't going to vote Joe no matter what.
The type of voter who would loudly announce they are never voting Biden - after going on the Biden reddit and getting offended by some meme - was never going to reliably vote for Biden anyways. There is a small vocal minority of Bernie Bros that are a list cause, they were never Dems, they reliably sit out elections or vote for Jill Stein. Energy spent on them is wasted. Focus instead on the Obama Dems we lost in 2016, and the #nevertrump Republicans. Those people vote. They are reasonable members of the political conversation and they can be persuaded using the core principles that our candidate stands for.
Yeah we just need to keep letting the people who openly hate us walk all over us, and someday we'll accrue enough niceness points with them that they'll give us votes!
I understand your sentiment but I don't think this meme is really that bad. IMO it's not attacking Bernie personally or calling his supporters names. It's simply stating that they had an expectation of what they'd get and they clearly didn't get it based off of polling information.  If you can show how this post violates the rules of the road though I'll down this post.
Nope.
You say "we" but your post history shows you entirely pro Bernie and anti Biden.  So by "we" do you mean Berniebros who don't like their faces rubbed in the fact that they keep losing and being wrong?
Is your kid under the age of 5?
Exactly my sentiment
You have no clue what toxicity is
We did that when America was a baby nation.  It worked out HORRIBLY.
A double octogenarian ticket for 2024?
Yeah Bernie's supporters did a hilariously terrible job of lowering expectations for Biden before going into this debate.
Yeah that's why you don't lower expectations of you opponent before a debate.
I don't disagree - I don't think Joe needed to do a lot in order for it to be considered a win for him (though imo he did pretty good). It's more that the prevailing sentiment among Sanders' supporters was that Joe would get stomped in a 1v1 with Bernie and have his supposed "cognitive decline" and lack of stamina exposed, in addition to getting routed on policy. They were positive this was going to be Joe's downfall, but the result was the complete opposite.
I also wanted to hear Biden finish, so here they are:  It’s a mix of PACs, superPACS, 501(c)4s (dark money), which are all functionally the same thing, but are regulated differently (e.g no donation caps or disclosing donors).     Sunrise Movement  Dream Defenders  Center for Popular Democracy Action  People’s Action  Our Revolution  Democratic Socialists of America  Make the Road Action  Progressive Democrats of America  Student Action
the one in which the majority of the democratic party lives, i guess

Lots of bernie bregaders tonight. Y'all mad about somethin'? :D
It helps that he won
[deleted]
Those are the same people who either didn’t vote in 2016 or voted for Trump. Nothing will satisfy them.
Don’t worry about r/politics. It’s somehow even less real life than Twitter.
If the primaries so far are any indication, those people probably wouldn't have bothered to vote anyway.
I've seen that since Bernie started to run. The DSA announced that they were not going to endorse anyone but Bernie.
I got into a couple of discussions, wasted a bunch of time trying to convince them blue no matter who.  And then I checked the profiles, all fucking Chapos.   If somebody posts in ChaposTrapHouse they are a lost cause.
There are so many foreign trolls their but the problem is they are brainwashing American voters...  We should take overtake the trolls in that forum. Its not technically a Bernie subreddit, the subreddit is suppose to be about politics in general . I'm not saying to post anything negative there . I am not even saying to post anything pro Joe there (yet).  I am saying to post there pro whomever the  Democrat nominee is and remind people how important it is to vote.
To be fair, a lot of Bernie folks I know only register as a Democrat to vote for Bernie. Most in that category would have never voted for a corporate democrat. At this point, I think it is obvious that we need more than 2 parties. If disenfranchised people vote for other parties they could get public funding and we could have a better discussion on issues.

I voted for Bernie in 2016 and voted early for Bernie in 2020 but the stupid Alzheimer's attacks on Biden from Bernie fans outraged me and converted me to a full Biden supporter. The attacks were extremely disrespectful and I did not want to be a part of any group that would freely spread such bullshit.
Bots. The comments are much more even keel, for r/politics anyway
http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fjlamt/debate_coach_biden_had_his_best_night_to_date/
You're right, it isn't objective, which is why it was interesting to me to see something that wasn't pro-Bernie being discussed in a relatively civil manner.
Quite a few states haven't voted yet.  Being on a Biden sub, why not be encouraged that some Sanders voters are thinking of switching candidate support?  **edit to also add: Shouldn't this also be encouraging as party unity in the general?
I seriously doubt me stating that some Sanders supporters were swayed over at r/politics to support Biden is going to have any impact on their actual vote.  And I sincerely hope that the threat of Trump picking more SCOTUS and federal judges would be enough incentive to just VOTE BLUE.
I'd bet money that Trump skips the debates
Specifically, it's a mix of PACs, superPACS, 501(c)4s (dark money), which are all functionally the same thing, but are regulated differently.  &#x200B;  Sunrise Movement  Dream Defenders  Center for Popular Democracy Action  People’s Action  Our Revolution  Democratic Socialists of America  Make the Road Action  Progressive Democrats of America  Student Action  &#x200B;  Bernie supporters, if you want to win support, stop gaslighting.  We're not stupid.
He was referring to “Our Revolution” and the DSA’s PACs
He should've listed them. I was watching the debate with my Mom, both of us went 'List them!' at the top of our lungs.
I know! What the hell happened there  EDIT: Why did it get deleted?
"Come on, give me a break."  "Lets not make this a back and forth about our politics."  During a debate....
Our Revolution
53 support groups is quite a bit of support
Do I smell a Bernie brother?
> speaks with passion  A passion for bad ideas is not passion worth having.   Biden 2020, fuck off Bernie Brother
That is the problem and why Trump is going to win again. Without Bernies supporters, Joe will lose.
Going to lay it out pretty clearly as a hardcore Progressive and Bernie support, so here's a pretty true but still biased way of how it is for us.  \>Talks about walking all over, as he walks over. No... You need to make real change to appeal to more people, there's not really any reason for me to vote for Biden over Trump. Like that's just the basic fact of it. Biden is a fine guy, he's smart enough, I especially liked how a few debates ago he still is aware of things like enumerated rights etc. But that doesn't give me any real reason to vote for him. It's literally just he could fill a SC spot (which Obama failed to do), and I guess he helps make us look more stable again? I mean that's an improvement I suppose, pretty low bar. My vote will never mean anything in this party, I still try, but I am well aware of how things are decided. As long as the Progressives continue to support the Democrats in the current fashion, we will continue to be completely ignored. So a slow death by medical debt or a death by fascist dictatorship, what's the difference? At least if Biden loses >maybe< the Democrats finally fucking accept that you need to appeal to us non-base people instead of telling us to fuck off every election.     I understand it to a point, because Young people don't really go out to vote, it's impossible to deny that and primaries are just the latest example. But this viewpoint ignores the General Election, and it ignores many Independents.     Independents are often Independents because they don't like something about the system. Continually trying to campaign on it has resulted in only Obama being strong enough to defeat a Republican 1 on 1. (I specifically say 1 on 1 because Bill Clinton would not have won the election without Ross Perot.) Biden is now crushing this primary not because of him suddenly being more electable, but because of a Kingmaker endorsement in South Carolina and major parts of the Moderate Wing just going his way and endorsing him right before ST and a total lack of unity from the entire Progressive Senate and people such as Jesse Jackson, refusing to endorse at opportune times like Biden had. Good on Biden, but that's not how you win a General Election. None of this shows that he's strong. That isn't going to get Independents to vote for him. They. Want. Change. This continues to be ignored, and it will continue to lose elections until the Democrats want to learn.
I am a Democrat first and foremost. I like the former vice president and believe removing Trump is a priority. My disdain for neoliberalism is secondary to the needs of the United States. Remember that for a long while Biden was the second choice of most Bernie supporters.
Haha, Comrade. He is a 25 year old physician who voters.
I didn't. But personally if I was a Biden supporter, I wouldn't celebrate it too much either or make this meme.
I mean it definitely wasn’t worst case scenario for joe but its really hard for me to define last night as a win for him
[removed]
I think the best explanation for people giving him the win is that he was pulling ahead before the debate and the debate itself wasn't a blow out (but i wouldn't call it a toss out either since I think Sanders was always a bit better than Biden).  Also that italy dig was very unnecessary, and might be proven short sighted if the US tackles the coronavirus even worse which from where I'm staying is a possibility.
[removed]
[removed]
You know who won the debate by looking at the subs. They are angry as fuck and we are celebrating.
This post hit my front page, I've never seen this sub before, and I'm not downvoting everybody, so I don't think I can count as a brigadier.   Idk about other supporters but I'm not mad about anything. Bernie wiped the floor with Biden, simple as that.
Trumpeatingpopcorn.jpg
Or Russians
It’s Twitter but instead of hot girls who don’t know what they’re talking about it’s passive aggressive nerds with no social skills who don’t know what they’re talking about.
I've noticed a lot of my posts criticizing Sanders are being deleted.
Third party weirdos. They have the same problems that have plagued Bernie's campaign - too many fringe ideas, unable to build coalitions, and trying to build a grassroots movement from the top down by running for president instead of local elections.
Bernie supporters are treated fine, especially when compared to how lots of supporters of literally anyone else have been treated by them.
Go vote. Polls don’t matter. 538 predictions don’t matter. We need wins. We need margin of victory. Go. Vote.
Also, just be aware, voting is always important. My state, Connecticut, isn’t up until April 28th, but there’s a town referendum on whether to appropriate money to build a new water tank. Therefore, I will be joining many of you in voting today. Electing Joe Biden is extremely important, but everything matters. Vote every chance you can. It’s how we are truly able to exercize government of, by, and for the people, rather than just showing up every 2 years to vote in the big ticket races or even only every 4 years to pick the president.  Also, I will take this oppertunity to urge a Yes vote on the water tank referendum if you happen to live in my town. Go Joe! But also, Go Yes!
Yes! Winning a state means pretty much nothing. It’s literally all about grabbing as many delegates as possible, which means every vote everywhere matters
Good point. The polls assume we will vote. Its pointless if we don't. The faster we win the faster the party can heal and focus on Trump
So true, every single vote sends a strong message for uncontested Convention.
just got out of my polling place in Michigan. I was literally the only person there to vote...
Yes!  Vote on the issues too.  Vote on local candidates.  Vote on referendums.
Sharing a story I shared the other day on ESS:  On Sunday, a friend of mine passed away from cancer at far, far FAR too young of an age.  We weren't even truly close. I met him through my brother in law and only ever interacted with him through Facebook after the wedding. But he was always so funny and interesting, his takes were always passionate but smart and measured. He was older than me and seemed so much more wise, even if it was only a 5 year difference. I tried to heed the free advice he offered up in his posts.  The very last thing he posted on Facebook just a few days ago has a core idea we can ALL agree on, even if many of us won't agree with the first part:  "I'm just putting this out there now. I may vote for Sanders or Warren in the Washington primary this week, but **I expect to vote for Biden in the general election and really hope you will, too,** should he become the nominee. This nightmare must end."  In the thread, he defended voting for Biden in the general against multiple folks slandering Biden's name. He liked the progressive politics of Bernie and Warren but he was not a purist. He understood what was at stake. Maybe better than any of us since so much more was at stake for him.  **Anyway if you needed any more reason to vote, do it for Eric.**  I'm devoting the rest of my fight against trump to him. To give him the outcome he should have lived to see: trump getting his ass handed to him.
I am in Florida and I would love to go out and vote sooo bad!!! But I have to contain myself till next week.
Personally I am motivated to vote for Joe in part to make the country's rejection of Sanders as abundantly clear as possible.
Not voting has given us the most far right supreme court in ages. Vote.
We can’t afford to lose a single state. Trump already showed his cards: attack the Dems and confuse the moderates by calling Bernie a communist. We need to win the White House and Diamond Joe is the way
YES! The more lopsided victories the better, so we can unify the party and turn the heat on Trump!
Not meaning to be contrarian here, but I only voted for Biden because of 538 predications. If it wasn't for 538 I would have voted for Klobuchar, but I saw that only Biden and Sanders (and maybe Bloomberg) had a shot so I voted for my favorite of the two.
Early voted for Joe in Florida like three or four days ago baby, me and mom
If 2016 didn’t teach people nothing will
Margins **matter**
I did!  😁
But I want to play Pokemon Go. If only there was some way to combine the two
I had to remind my family in Detroit and Ann Arbor to vote for Biden today. I felt like a call center!
We need health insurance reform, and legalized marijuana   I hope you can bring us home Joe!
Margins **matter**
That being said, being over >99/100 to win a plurality (the standard at which Sanders said all should be held to) means that it's looking pretty good.
I’m 17 and British so that might be a bit hard
[removed]
> Electing Joe Biden is extremely important, but everything matters. Vote every chance you can  Hell... If you want to vote for Bernie or write-in Andrew Yang go vote and do that! What matters is democratic turnout and we need to set a strong foundation for November.
They're putting that on the primary ballot and not on the actual election day ballot?
[removed]
Heal...?
I think it usually picks up after 3-5pm when people who work the day shift head home.
Early voting in Florida is in swing March 7-14 for Presidential Preference Primary elections. [Here’s the link](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/election-dates/) to the website. Additionally, each county supervisor of elections can open early voting March 2-6 and in March 15th! I know in Duval county, Mike Hogan opened it up starting the 2nd, if I remember my sample ballot correctly.
Imagine being in one of the states in May or June!  It will pretty much be decided by then, but I will absolutely vote on May 2nd!  Or before if I decide to mail it in early.
Can I ask why you want the country to reject Sanders? Seriously. We can have a rational conversation.
THANK YOU. Anyone who refuses to vote because their candidate didn't win should just go slap RBG, and while they're at it - women everywhere, in the face.
How is Joe going to bring in the left to vote for him?
It's the exact same for me, by the way (even to the point of Klobuchar being my favorite candidate).  I'll also add that if the polling and delegate situation were reversed with Bernie having >99% in the model and uniform double-digit polling leads, and I lived in one of today's states instead of a ST state, I would (grudgingly) vote for Bernie for the sake of party unity.    A contested convention is the actual worst possible outcome IMO.
Same.  Here’s hoping our girl gets a cabinet position.  She’d be a great Attorney General!  Or VP, but my money is on Kamala or Beto.
Thank you for being you! We appreciate it!
Joe doesn't want to legalize marijuana.
Hey, vote Lib Dem or Labour next time!  Assuming Labour gets new leadership.
I don't know what he said regarding that subject. Do you have an article I can read about it?
just a alt right troll. ignore and move along.
It’s not on either. It’s a special referendum today. Our primary is on April 28th. We also usually have our annual town budget referendum in early April. I doubt they’ll combine that with the primary election, and this referendim wasn’t combined with the budget referendum or anything. This question was the only thing on the ballot.
Y’all really got nothing worth doing, huh.
If Trump wants to talk about nepotistic corruption, let's.
And Biden will be like *”Look at what the fuck his kids are actually doing”*
Would you prefer... festering?
true.
I prefer voting on election day because my polling station is literally a block from my house and I remind every single of my friends to go and vote that day on social media with a pic of my polling station.
[https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/fdp1km/to\_bernie\_supporters\_coming\_here\_to\_ask\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/fdp1km/to_bernie_supporters_coming_here_to_ask_about/)     Bernie cannot win the general election. His electability is a mirage.
Sure, I'm happy to share my honest opinion.  I dislike Sanders as a candidate. He's old, in poor health, divisive, revels in conflict, and attacks Democrats (not exactly endearing him to Democrats). He's a Washington insider (30 years in Congress with little to show for it) who likes to pretend he's an outsider, a millionaire who likes to pretend he's not, a non-democrat who decided he would run as a Democrat the day he decided he wanted to be president (happy to try to take the resources of the DNC rather than run as an independent, while also trying to shit all over the DNC); in other words I find him to be a dishonest hack. I think his absolutist stances are ridiculous. As a doctor I think his stance on Medicare for all is actually very poorly thought out and will accelerate negative changes occurring in the healthcare system. His protectionist/isolationist stances would worsen our retreat from the national stage. He's an ideologue and I don't trust him to have the cognitive flexibility required for good leadership.   His supporters are also disproportionately jackasses, and I think there's a reason for that - leadership can either draw out the best in people or the worst in people, and Sanders (like Trump) draws out the worst in his supporters.  So, I don't like him and I think he would be a bad president - and I won't vote for someone I think will be a bad president. I wouldn't vote for him in the general, and I'd like to be able to vote for a Democrat against Trump. But I won't vote for one old loud divisive millionaire ideologue jackass that I don't trust over another old loud divisive millionaire ideologue jackass that I don't trust.
If his team can operate an effective anti propaganda campaign while relentlessly attack trump at every angle it could convince the undecided left that he’s the lesser of the two evils. (Disclaimer: Not saying that Biden is “the lesser of the two evils”, I’m playing the devils advocate)
I’m a Conservative party member, I voted for Boris to lead the Tory party last summer. Lib Dem’s are barely a party at this point and labour are socialist (not Bernie moderate socialist, 1970s economic failure and dangerous socialist)  UK conservatism is basically the Democrats. Trump is too extreme for most Tories and I don’t like his policies
That's a good way to ensure low turnout.
Well they ain’t voting
I would prefer actual healing, which historically is not the Dem's strength.  Biden, Sanders, and Warren are making it even harder than usual.
Makes sense. My polling station is the same, literally a five minute walk from my driveway to a church. But my early voting place is a nice public library, and I like going in there a lot more.
Just stating a fact here. They are only a year apart in age, which voids your age argument.
Thank you for responding. We have very different views but I don't think either of us are up for being moved from our position. Your most surprising view to me is that he is dishonest. Whilst I can understand opposing his policies and not liking what he stands for I would have thought that it is apparent to all that he is at least honest and consistent. Can I ask if you believe that Biden is more honest than Sanders? Or it is a lesser of two evils scenario for you?  And for those that downvoted me, I literally just asked a question. The toxic supporters is an issue for all candidates, Sanders and Biden included.
>revels in conflict  Citation missing, and a leader who won't shy away from conflict IS A GOOD THING. You don't want a pussy like yourself in office.  >and attacks Democrats (not exactly endearing him to Democrats).   Loyalty to a party is stupid.   >a millionaire who likes to pretend he's not,  Barely one, with an unimpressive financial situation. Further, no he doesn't pretend that. You forgot citations again.  > As a doctor I think his stance on Medicare for all is actually very poorly thought out and will accelerate negative changes occurring in the healthcare system.   Experts and every other first world country disagree. Just say what you mean, you're upset about your bottom line because you're a bottom feeder.  >His supporters are also disproportionately jackasses  You should look in a mirror, if you can get your head out of your ass.  >and Sanders (like Trump) draws out the worst in his supporters  Trump appeals to trash. Sanders appeals to the best of us. Don't be mad at me for being a better person than you and trying to lift you up while helping the people you want to shit on. You're too stupid for your own good so of course we have to be stern with you, it's not like you're going to help yourself or anyone else.  > I won't vote for one old loud divisive millionaire ideologue jackass that I don't trust over another old loud divisive millionaire ideologue jackass that I don't trust.  Looks like you're going to have to since people like yourself fucked up the primaries so badly so far.
Conservatives may be more closely aligned to Democrats, but Boris Johnson is still a problem.  He’s Trump-Lite.  New Labour was where it’s at.  Clinton and Tony Blair were bros until Clinton left office and Bush had Blair by the balls over Iraq.
Well, they put sandwich board signs up around town, and sent an official notice in the mail to everyone, so I guess whatever happens happens.
Local issues tend to be done like that.  My school district loves to have bond issues on special election ballots.
Shit, you've seen how many former competitors in this race that have endorsed Biden? We're bringing this country together so fast, you'll have whiplash.
They asked why I dislike Sanders, not why I like Biden. My first choice in the primary was Pete Buttigieg, partly because of his age. Biden's age is a negative factor for me, but he has none of the other problems I have with Bernie.
>And for those that downvoted me, I literally just asked a question. The toxic supporters is an issue for all candidates, Sanders and Biden included.  This is dishonest at best. Sure, all candidates have toxic supporters. An overwhelming majority of them are coming from one candidate. Every non-Bernie supporter has noticed this. Even Warren talked about it on Maddow recently.
If he were honest, I feel he would run as an independent rather than trying to leech off the DNC/Democratic establishment (while simultaneously railing against it).  Other areas of dishonesty: that young people certainly will show up and vote for him (not actually happening), that a magical voter surge will somehow override roadblocks in Congress (unrealistic and not happening), that everyone he dislikes is "the establishment."  In the 90s he stated he would never run as a Democrat, and it would be hypocritical of him to do so. That's fine, take that nonsense elsewhere then and stop running to be president while pretending to be a Democrat.  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/bernie-sanders-2016-democrats-121181
*And for those that downvoted me, I literally just asked a question. The toxic supporters is an issue for all candidates, Sanders and Biden included.*  This is the Joe Biden subreddit.  What do you think would happen if a Biden supporter went into a GotV thread in S4P and asked why they wanted to reject Biden?  Upvotes?  Of course it'd be downvoted, probably quite heavily.  I didn't downvote you but I wouldn't call that toxicity.  Toxicity is Warren's most recent tweet about coronavirus (which doesn't mention the presidential primary) being brigaded with nasty comments, almost entirely by supporters of one particular presidential candidate, and I don't think I have to tell you which candidate's supporters it is.  The fact that we both know exactly which candidate's supporters it is, without looking, is the problem.
Why does stuff like this get downvotes?
By all means, continue, perhaps my opinion of Sanders and his supporters as angrily ranting will be changed by your angry ranting.
New labour were better than the socialist labour but they still went on to commit war crimes. Also Boris is way more like the Democrats than Trump, he’s not a trump lite because of hair lmao
Hahahahaha yikes okay  You sound exactly as entranced as a Bernie bro or Trumper, come on man
Holy fuck how did someone so stupid become a doctor? Please quit before your lack of concern, intelligence, and competence kills one of your patients. You know, a patient you didn't already want to kill for being poor.
I understand. I would argue that some of what you are calling dishonesty is misjudgement but I appreciate your viewpoints on all of this.
Look at my previous response on this. Everyone needs to understand more about where everyone else is coming from which requires rational discussion between supporters of different candidates. Think what you want of Bernie and his supporters, you need a lot of them to vote for Joe in the general if he gets the nomination. Downvoting anyone who disagrees is not the way to drive unity. This is absolutely also true of Bernie's supporters.
It’s not just his hair.  He’s a fervent supporter of Brexit which itself is a movement based on the same nationalist ideas that Trump stirs up with his wall.  They’re both populists.  Jeremy Corbyn is bad, but that doesn’t make Boris Johnson good.
Voter turnout is *up* this time compared to last time. But sure yeah whatever. Believe what you want, man, I'm not gonna stop you.
By all means, continue, you're so convincing.
Fair play to you for civility. I'd love to see more like you and wish the most prominent folks for every dem candidate in this race had been civil and honourable
Actually, Biden really doesn’t need Bernie supporters to win in November.  He needs the real Democratic base along with moderate independents and Republicans.  Those “undecided” voters that CNN likes to trot out.  There will undoubtedly be Bernie supporters that do the right thing and vote for Biden in November, but plenty will stay home in protest.
Nationalism is way stronger in Trumps policies than in The Tories. I’m a Brexit supporter, but not because I want to “bring back the good ol days”, it’s because the EU places too many restrictions on us, and it’s transformation into a political union with unelected officials making decisions that do not have UK interests in mind is not what we signed up for IMO. Tories don’t hate Europe, we simply disagree with the EU, there is a difference
More votes can't hurt.
[removed]
No, but we don’t need to be held hostage by a group we don’t need to win.
the IRA are non existent at this point and a suitable and sustainable situation has been established in the Irish Sea.
As long as both sides uphold their end of the bargain and don’t leave Northern Ireland in the middle, sure.
Name a more iconic duo
Omg I chortled. Thank you to the Joe Biden community for making this former Pete supporter feel so welcome. I can't explain how much this is helping to mend a broken heart. Take us home, Uncle Joe.
I love this. Let’s meme this into reality.
Not gonna lie, if they actually made this ticket and campaigned as "PB&J", they would have my immediate and unconditional support. I don't care if their healthcare plan is outlawing hospitals and their economic stimulus involved Monopoly money!
I think it would be a great match. I think Joe needs someone young and energetic with policies slightly left of his own (and I say that as someone to the right of Joe). But unfortunately I think he'll choose a VP with more diversity points.
Reminded me of Obama-Biden.      Biden-Pete were cute together!!
"Oh I get, it's very clever"
OMG
[How could you forget?](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/biden-obama-32.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1200)
Many times I heard Pete talk about picking a vice president and how important it is to think about what would happen to the country if he died in office.  Not a fun thought but an incredibly important one.  You need a vice president that can be ready to govern on day one.  This will be paramount in the decisions going forward for the country for Biden and Bernie supporters.  Optics be damned I am looking for a seamless transfer and unity.  This is it.
oh I can think of one...
Son & Father☺️
I love Pete but I don't think the ticket will have him as VP. Diversity is important for us and since we have an older white man as the lead, it would be vital for a young, female minority to be the VP. Either Kamala or Stacey Abrams for sure. I'd gladly vote for Pete in 2024 however.
Lol
This made my day 🤣
I don't think that will happen though. Not as VP. But Pete will be something 👍
[removed]

I love this.
Biden and Beto...or as I call them: Bideto
Biden doesn’t support the gays though
Amy and joe
Kings of the Deep State
Yes, I agree! With really only one exception, I've been made VERY welcome on #TeamJoe and I love it! The same goes over on the TeamJoe2020 Slack. The people there are awesome! It really means a lot to me that they instituted Pete's Rules of the Road here and there. They didn't have to do that. It was very thoughtful and welcoming.
[deleted]
I think a Buttigieg / Pence debate could be really excellent actually. I mean, Joe already is winning with a diverse group of supporters. Joe needs college educated whites in the suburbs, and Pete could appeal to that need.
He probably should but considering who they're going to run against they don't need to.
For whom? If he wins the Primary, diversity points mean a lot less in the general.
Of all the potential VP picks, I obviously like Pete, but would have Pete levels of excitement for Stacey Abrams.
Unfortunately that's correct.  I wish he'd pick Pete for VP though.  Would make things interesting and help tame the hard left swing we otherwise might experience in the future.
Biden is the one big dem candidate that can get away with a non POC vice. He already has the black people vote.
Kamala is the worst - I really hope it's not her
It will be Kamala

Thank you for the request, comrade.  jillanco has not said the N-word yet.
They would probably really go after each other. Pete could point to exactly how Pence statewide policy affected life in South Bend and what he did to mitigate the negatives
Pete was the one getting those Republicans to jump ship, especially in the midwest... Where Joe absolutely has to win. Biden/Buttigieg could very well be a winning ticket.
She would be great too, she's very bright.
I'm of the opinion that Abrams is too unknown nationally to be a significant boost to Biden, and I don't know that she can make the southern states flippable right now.   The Midwest and possibly Texas are the prizes that decide 2020.
Perhaps, but the party still wouldn't like the optics of it. I think it would be a POC for the optics of diversity, not necessarily for the vote. If anything, it would be a progressive leaning candidate in hopes of making it easier for the Bernie bros to vote for Biden in the general.   To my knowledge Kamala is not a progressive like Bernie, and I don't think Abrams is either.  Is there a POC, female and progressive candidate?
Fuck that no way
What is this bot?
Not that I love that ticket, but I have a friend in DC who works on campaigns and told Me the secret
If you ever use the n-word it knows and tells everyone.  It is a quick way to weed out racists from a conversation.
She’s so unlikeable. I rather Stacey abrams, if warren and Biden can compromise that would be ideal.
Lmao sounds like Alex Jones and all the undisclosed NASA scientists feeding him info
Alright.   But I also want to be mindful that one can have productive disagreements and conversations with racists as well. It’s the exact mentality that “I can’t listen to a word you say because  you said something I don’t like” that’s destructive to a functional democracy. I understand the n word is almost as bad as it gets, but even so why do people need to be characterized immediately? This was meant to dismiss and cancel.
Andrew Yang endorses Joe Biden for president!
Yang Gang member here, I've been teetering to Joe Biden anyways lately, this is the final straw. Let's go give 'em hell, Joe! Y'all think Yang will get a good cabinet position?
Our memes are about to get way better. 🔥   Edit: with a quick look at Twitter I don't think this will get us Yang voters nearly as much as toxic Bernie Bros dragging Andrew through the mud. 😐
I've always liked that Yang fellow. I liked that he brought attention to a real issue people aren't paying attention too. I hope he actually runs for something again in the future.
this is my new home. lets do it
Hopefully his supporters come with him
Yang did the math, knows Joe is the best path forward!
I hope Andrew stays active in politics. Appreciated his fresh views and reasonable thinking on a lot of the issues
I respect the fact that he didn't endorse right away, to bring attention to UBI and to launching the HumanityFirst initiative.   And I respect him for recognizing tonight that the time had come. Smart guy, interesting ideas, good political instincts. We haven't heard the last from him.
Biden has not necessarily earned my vote, so I did still do Yang in IL (early voter). However, I do think I'm slowly being convinced Biden is the better option in the end between running candidates.
YANG GANG **assemble**
So we have a new banner within our coalition now? I loved the yang supporters throughout this whole election.
Really like Andrew Yang. I hope he has a place in the Biden administration.  He really understands root problems and not just the symptoms of a situation.  And is a data guy.  Seems to have a decent relationship with Joe.
Yang gang coming over in force now. Y'all got a discord?
Fun fact, I bought a MATH hat from his website after reading through his policy list (and because it’s a cool hat). I still have it.  UNITE!
February-September yang gang  September-February Pete  February— now Biden  Let’s win this  Gen Z FOR BIDEN
Fun fact: Yang's campaign manager said Yang chose to endorse Biden on the fly, live on CNN. There was no backroom deals or what not.  Like Yang himself justified on-air; his decision is based on the math and need to unify the Dem party fast.  And probably also because he has an existing friendship with Joe and Joe was calling almost every week and talking with Andrew himself on phone, probably begging for his endorsement haha.
The math candidate joins on when Biden's victory is all but a statistical certainty
Yang has some of the most intelligent and cool supporters I've ever met. If they join him & us in the coalition, I'm stoked!
Welcome, Yang Gang. Love y'all, always have!
YOOOOO I love my boy. Can't wait for him to be high up in Joe's administration
A very bright, bold person with lots of new ideas. Mr Yang will have a bright future. Mayor of New York City might be a geat way to demonstrate his proposals. Wouldn't it be something if it became affordable to live there?
Avengers assemble!
YES!!!   YangGang, it's time to move humanity forward!!!  #BidenYang2020   P.S. If you check our Yang sub, it's currently been infiltrated by Bernie bros disguised as fake YangGangers, so please laugh and discard them.
That's actually very surprising to me. Anything better then Bernie
Yang Gang!!
Bernie supporters were really hoping for this endorsement the last few days. Hard to pin Yang as establishment. As someone in a entrepreneurship network that Yang is part of, I’m happy he’s backing Joe.
[deleted]
Yesss, welcome Yang Gang!
Always room on the Biden bus.
Now there is just one more candidate that we need to endorse Biden - and that's BS
This night keeps getting better and better.
Malarkey tried to sneak up on Yang and he said GTFO!
Man, that's crazy. He looks eerily similar to the next Secretary of Labor.
I suggested Warren should just keep her head down and look after herself, heres hoping Andrew Yang doesn't cop wrath now - he'll be labelled a republican in about 4 seconds of course!
I’m so happy!  Edit: twizzlers and martinis for all!
WOO
question is now... how long until the big guy (B.O.) steps in and endorses Joe as well.
 Biden/yang is peak ticket
And Biden’s first policy proposal is $1000 to every adult as stimulus to fight the economic impact of the coronavirus
Joe Gang!
🎉 🎉🎉
I like Yang a lot but we have to remember he's doing that because Biden has no statistical chance to lose any more.
"This process is very important for voters to make their voices heard and see what the direction of the party is." - Yang in February  I respect holding onto an endorsement and releasing it mid-momentum, after more folks had the chance to make their voice heard. He did the math!  Serious question though, how did his supporters break after he suspended his campaign? I felt they skewed more Bernie?
I love that UBI is still in play...
Not the most enthusiastic endorsement but I'll take it.   He basically said it was the math, lol
Math for all kids.  Kids all cry
I'm not seeing anything online you have a link?
Who's updating the poster again?
Yeeeet
HELL YEAH
My love!
Former Yang Ganger here. So glad to hear this I knew it would go this way.
YEA
Mayor Yang!
I'm still a bit upset as a Bernie supporter over how these last few weeks have gone but I can guarantee that I will be there on election day happily voting for Joe. Any Democrat is better than Trump. I'm interested to see if Yang gets offered a position in the Biden administration, I think he would be great.
‘I wager a hundred dollars on the winning horse!’
I’m 100% here now
I’m a Yang Supporter who has felt lost since he dropped out. I’m all for Joe now.
Why did the Democratic party decide to throw up the election during the primaries?
Yang gang reporting in for Joe!!!! Love them both!
Yang Gang checking in where do I go to set my flair :)
I love Andrew Yang...hope Joe gives him a cabinet position...
Lmao Donny is definitely going to win another term. Unbelievable because he sucks but the people have spoken! Going to have time to groom and market another candidate though, so that's a positive.

Is this a meme?
[removed]
Absolutely. First Secretary of Technology here we come
We need mayor yang though
I think everyone in this primary process will, except Bernie. They all have something of value to contribute, and none of them will hurt the admin.
The Yang gang was a force in this primary. I was in awe of the unity and enthusiasm y'all showed on reddit and twitter. I am so happy and relived to have you and the Yang Gang on the Bye-Don Team.  - Hugs from a Betocrat who supports Joe Biden
Oh hell yes there's Humanity First flair here
I wouldn't mind Yang in the FTC or as a tech czar. Something like that. No matter what he needs to be promoted as a leading party figure. He's a bit of an uncut diamond but his relentless positivity could nake for a formidable political presence.
Dont worry, twitter isnt real life
You have no idea. They were attacking Yang nonstop and then went full vulture mode when he dropped out. And then started attacking him again when all his supporters didn't magically switch over
What you see on Twitter is less than meaningless. Any group of 50-100 people can create a narrative about anything that is totally disconnected from reality.
*Multiple* real issues that people tend to not pay attention to. UBI is definitely the focal point but he's about a lot more than that
I believe he’s considering a bid for NYC mayor.
Welcome, happy to have MATH on our side!
Hugs, Yang gang friend!
Welcome. I certainly was inspired by Yang's campaign. He has a bright future in the Democratic party.
Welcome! Glad to have the power of the Yang Gang on our side
Happy to have you! I respect Yang a lot as a person, and he has some good ideas. The MATH is in our favor.
Hope he gets VP tbh
[removed]
Been here before Yang even endorsed 😎 proud of Yang for following the MATH!
Joe was my second choice for a while and I immediately supported him after Yang dropped out.
Yang's MAGA supporters will either go back to Trump or write in Yang in the general. Some will vote for Joe. Can't say about the Dems.
He has some great, smart supporters. Honestly it was kinda bumming me out that there weren't too many around here. Hopefully that'll change today!
Been here bro
I really hope he could be a wildcard VP as I think he'd bring something unique to the campaign that no one else could (he appeals to young voters and Republicans and has a very online campaign whereas Joe appeals to older voters)  I don't think he will but if he doesn't I hope he gets an admin position
Thank you! I’m proud to be part of the Biden bus and I’m proud to always be a Yang supporter. He’ll continue to make us proud!
You voted, that’s all that matters. Compare records, proposals, etc. So long as you’re happy with how you voted, that’s what matters. It’s always your choice in the primaries and the general.
Welcome! Pete was my first choice but I waited to vote an then Pete dropped out. But I've been very impressed with Biden, I feel like he gets Yang's "Humanity First" idea, and has embodied it with his political career. That's how he got so many endorsements, and how he's winning over so many voters

YANG GANG
Here!
Bidens memes will now get a whole lot better
Here! I brought crawfish.
Bernie Bro here, congrats on the big wins and can't wait to vote for the Dem nominee with y'all. I'm a progressive who views Trump's 2nd term as the biggest threat to the progressive movement ... we can't let Trump continue to stack the Supreme Court and court system with far-right operatives
Welcome!
Welcome aboard, we need everyone we can get for November.
you rock.
Welcome!! Thanks for the trust in party unity over politics!
We might not agree on solutions, but we all agree on the same problems. Climate change, economic inequality, universal healthcare, etc.
We need you..we r not the enemy. Plese spread this with tour fellow bernie bros. We are i  tbis together
Welcome. Bernie ran a helluva race. And he probably pushed biden left. His run was not in vain.
Thank you, and welcome. Despite the rivalries and divisiveness typical of a primary, in the end we are all on the same team. Now is the time to unite behind Joe, and yes, Bernie's voice and platform must also be heard.
I am also a Warren / Bernie guy here to rally with Joe. Lets win in 2020. This election is far too important to be divided.
Come in, we will hug you until you feel better then we can all, as a team, get to work!
I’m a Bernie supporter too, the writing’s been on the wall since last week. Time to kick the orange clown to the curb.
Absolutely agree! Before you shed too many tears, [take a look at Biden's position on issues](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/). You might realize he is more progressive than S4P might lead you to believe.
Welcome, we have cookies!    Seriously, though, Trump is the biggest threat here, and we are happy to have you on board.
Fighting side by side with a friend!
Thank you! This cannot he stated enough. Even though I disagreed with so much of the Sander’s campaign, I would’ve voted for him no matter what if he had won this process.
ONE OF US   ONE OF US   ONE OF US
Welcome aboard. You don't have to stop loving Bernie to vote for Joe.
While it is gut wrenching I did not get my preferred candidate I'm fully on board to get Biden elected. I want RBG to retire and live out her days in peace. That women is one of my heroes. Let's get this shit done in November. United we stand, divided we fall.
Welcome. anyone willing to support the nominee is cool with me And not someone I consider a BernieBro in the pejorative sense.
Now you just need to convince other Bernie Bros the same thing. Tell them to go out and vote in the general election. I’d like to think we’d all vote for Bernie in the General, go convince then to vote for Biden. I don’t want 4 more years of trump.
You’re totally right! For those who think the slower pace to progressive programs that Biden represents, they have to look past that and see what trump represents. The left will absolutely be heard in a Biden admin! I’m a Warren to Biden convert, I believe in Joe.
Welcome to the team!
Damn right. Welcome!
Get in here, you. 💙🇺🇸
Welcome! We are going to win together!
Welcome! Bernie ran a hell of a race. I’m excited to see him be Biden work together to take down Trump.
United we stand, divided we fall.
I voted for Bernie as well but will happily vote for Biden.   There’s going to be a lot of anger the next while just like there has been the last week or two.   A lot of Bernie’s supporters are young and may not have participated in politics before. So losing is a new thing. As for me, I haven’t voted for a winning primary/general candidate since Bush 2004 (there’s a party switch in there after 2012 in case anyone was wondering). I’m used to it.   So, for those of us who supported Bernie in 2016 this is like reliving that again. For me though it doesn’t hurt as bad this time. I had never been a fan of Hillary and having to hold my nose and vote for her in 2016 sucked, but Joe’s a good guy even if I don’t agree with all his positions and I won’t feel conflicted voting for him. Certainly not with Trump as the opposition.
People fail to realize that Joe may enact a more progressive agenda than Bernie.  Because Joe can deliver the Senate, and Bernie can't. You can see this based on who is motivated to vote.  Any Dem President with a Dem House and Senate can enact a ton of progressive legislation. If an angry Bernie got into the White House, he wouldn't be able to get anything enacted. Even most Democrats in Congress dislike him, to put it mildly.  Moreover, we "centrists" are mostly not less progressive. You can see this in the exit polling showing people support M4A but support Joe over Bernie. Because "centrists" are in reality pragmatists who are concerned about winning first. 2/3 of the party is very loudly demonstrating they know their swing voter peers and know Bernie would lose in the fall. The fact that the thinking of 2/3 of the party is completely foreign to Bernie voters only says that we're living in bubbles and the internet is broken.  Joe just wants his lifelong dream of being President. He's talked about 1 term. He said the other day he is "only a bridge" to a new generation of young leaders. He's going to let them run policy. And they know if they don't enact a progressive agenda, then they'll have no place in the future of the Dem party.
Well said
You da man
We are so happy to have you!
Welcome aboard.
Welcome.
No longer are you a Bernie Bro, but now a "Bernie Brother" let's beat Trump!
I honestly think a 4-3 supreme court in favor of conservatives is THE BEST composition possible.    But I'm more conservative than most who will vote democrat.  I just really don't like the whole "living document" idea, and the notion of the supreme court acting as a pseudo legislative branch.  Ideally you have liberal law makers, and a conservative supreme court.  Lawmakers push a progressive agenda and the court tells them when they're out of line.
Welcome!
My G
Welcome and let’s get ready to take back our country :-)
I hope all your brothers are as rational as you =)  This fight is bigger than Biden and Bernie.  It is about the soul of our nation.  4 more years of DT and we America will no longer be as we know it
If you think Trump is a bigger threat to progressive values than Biden, then you are mistaken, friend. History shows that leftist political movements are undermined by the empty promises of centrist incrementalism. This progresses until the majority of the population are deeply unsatisfied with the status quo, and that's when fascism slips in. It has happened time and time again. The Spanish civil war is a perfect example of this. The greatest threat to this country right now is the promise to bring us back to "normalcy." It is going to end very, very badly. Bernie was our last shot at changing the course of history through electoralism. It is time to start investing in dual power, and finding alternative ways to defend ourselves against the tides of neoliberalism and fascism-- they both lead to the same place. And we don't have time to meander on in the face of climate change, ecocide, perpetual war, growing income inequality, the prison industrial complex, colonialism and imperialism. All of these things have been propped up by the neoliberal agenda which Biden has played a central role in fortifying for five decades. He and his ilk led us to this ugly moment. *Let this radicalize you rather than lead you to despair*. Find a local leftist group, learn skills to share, partake in mutual aid, support actual leftist candidates if you have the option, build community, but don't cave to the pressures of mainstream political discourse. It only leads to disaster.
love the positivity in this thread, but do people really think that Bernie can't win? I just feel like if all the people on the fence just went with Bernie, we wouldn't have to worry about Trump getting a second term. just my 2 cents though

Unity over politics sounds horrible tho..  in a all the kids jumped off the cliff kinda way.
Hear, hear!
I can’t wait until all of our Bernie Brothers in arms are able to unleash their full fury on the worst president in history
As a current Bernie supporter who wanted to give Joe a chance, I wouldn’t recommend people his page. It’s literally 0 actual policies and just talking points. That was one of the worst websites I’ve seen in regards to what he wants to get done
Couldn't even view his policies without donating.... wtf
Aye, I could do that.

Hey you, Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me?
Joe has admitted that he isn’t willing to change anything though. We are just setting ourselves up for another trump in the future. Telling a room of donors “nothing will fundamentally change” doesn’t sound very progressive to me.
The "living document" interpretation was literally what the founding fathers envisioned. It was John Marshall who wrote "we must remember that it is a constitution that we are expounding," one applicable "to future generations" - meaning that it was a foundational document, but could never be considered exhaustive. The idea that we, as a society, should be held to the strict confines of something written 230 years ago, which codified the ownership of human beings, isn't only ludicrous on its face, but is a novel interpretation, advanced by those who would use our constitution only to deny, rather than confer, liberty.
You realize most “minorities” voted for Biden, right? And for Hillary in 2016?
You aren't helping anything! Vote blue no matter who!
Even though you've come into our house to rant, we're going to make America a better place for people like you. You're angry. We get it. Biden is going to make sure RBG's fight was not in vain. He's going to make sure climate change is addressed. When you catch your breath, take a look at his positions. I bet you'll find a few that you didn't know about if you've only followed the "reddit stream media. "   He's not the boogeyman you've been told about.
And if Bernie can't beat Biden, then he can't win against trump.
Malarkey!
Look up Dr. Rachel Bitecofer. Her model shows you absolutely can. It's all about turnout, much less about swinging voters as previously believed. She's very interesting and may give you more confidence in Biden. She's not a Biden supporter or anything but she explains a lot about what an uphill battle Trump has here.
No longer Bernie Bros, were all Blue Bros now 💙💙💙
Click the text that says "continue to joebiden.com"
Ok.
Well, look at the turnout. People were enthusiastic to vote for him. There is a country full of people with differing opinions outside of Reddit
The document says what it says.  There is a process to amend it.  Interpreting it however you please was never the intention.  Maybe I wasn't clear in my disdain for the "living document" theory.    I have ZERO issues with amending the Constitution and believe it is more than necessary as we travel through the ages.  But in my opinion, and many others, it is not the role of the supreme court to "reenvision" the words of the document.    The supreme Court should interpret the Constitution as originally intended.  When changes are needed, you go through the requisite process to amend the document.  Instead, it seems that both sides of the aisle are now relying on the supreme court as a pseudo legislative body that ramrods in new interpretations because it's easier than actually accumulating the necessary support to actually amend the document.
Yeah, kinda shows that you only need to pull certain community leaders and suddenly Biden is the same as Obama...black by association huh?...
I am helping. I'm not supporting corruption. Bernie isn't Bernie if he voted with the popular vote to go to war in Iraq.

Damn straight. Every vote in every state.  November, and a reckoning, are coming.
> Maybe I wasn't clear in my disdain for the "living document" theory.  And maybe I wasn't clear in my disdain for "originalism," a theory invented from whole cloth in the last 40 years, which ignores 200 years of consistent, unwavering precedent that the Constitution provides a general framework, rather than an exhaustive set of powers for the federal government or rights for the people.  From fucking **1819,** in a unanimous decision of the Marshall Court:  >A Constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by which they may be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code, and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably never be understood by the public. **Its nature, therefore, requires that only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be deduced from the nature of the objects themselves.** That this idea was entertained by the framers of the American Constitution is not only to be inferred from the nature of the instrument, but from the language. Why else were some of the limitations found in the 9th section of the 1st article introduced? It is also in some degree warranted by their having omitted to use any restrictive term which might prevent its receiving a fair and just interpretation. **In considering this question, then, we must never forget that it is a *Constitution* we are expounding.**  But I'm sure you know more than John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, and more or less every single influential jurist who didn't concoct a constitutional interpretation to support their revanchist political ideology.  To be clear, originalism, as a theory, is the "confederate monuments" of constitutional interpretation.  It sure as hell wasn't intended to do anything other than marginalize the marginalized.
African American voters are the most savvy, intelligence and practical voters in the electorate.   They know Joe.  What are you even talking about?
I was mainly taking about you saying you're voting for trump, vote for any Democrat, our democracy depends on it!
We'll see. Doesn't seem like a good night for Bernie.
Actually. He’s good.
I'm talking about a candidate who has a lifetime of work for the poor, disenfranchised and the oppressed. That is Bernie Sanders.  While Joe Biden was Barack Obama vice president. What's there to talk about?
I don’t get the sense that you understand the black community or politics very well.
I get a felling you actually believe that YOU do...
Ok. See ya around.
Pete Buttigieg Appreciation Thread
**Notice:** This thread will temporarily be unstickied.  Another thread will go up in its place. There are also several live events scheduled for later today.
Pete is going to have an amazing career, the only thing holding him back is his lack of experience, and I'm sure that will change. I am so excited to see what he accomplishes, and God willing perhaps vote for him for POTUS one day!  Pete supporters, please make your new home here!
I gotta say, I REALLY have a lot of respect for Pete for dropping out at this time knowing staying in would only help Sanders. For all the insults people have thrown at him, it really shows he truly has the country in mind.
The way he defended Joe on the debate stage against attacks aimed at his son. That was admirable. Pete has such strength of character and integrity. Even dropping out now shows what a wise and sincere person he is. Pete has a great future ahead.
I early voted for him. It was close between him and Joe. To right the err of my ways, I will donate $50 to joe every paycheck   \💎7 \🐊7
As a mod over at /r/Pete_Buttigieg thanks for the kind words everyone.
Since I started paying attention to this election last year Biden and Buttigieg were the two candidates I bounced back and forth on. Ultimately I choose Biden as you all know just because I believe we need someone who is ready day one but I have never been so blindsided by a candidate.  Buttigieg is one of the best role models and people I've seen on the national stage. He's highly intelligent, charming, compassionate. He genuinely seems like a model person.  I loved his speaking style. One of the reasons people smeared him was because his command of language was too good to be true. But it was true. He could disseminate information and repackage concepts in more palatable ways like an artist.   Some of my favorite Buttigieg moments were of course him and Chasten, discovering he had a secret twitter and instagram page for his dogs, and learning about his love of language learning.   On language: language is something I have an interest in too. Seeing a candidate with at least an elementary grasp in eight languages was pretty cool to see. Especially since american Presidents have been notorious for being English only. Obviously translators exist but learning a language, a culture helps open ones mind to a different perspective. There's stories of Buttigieg translating Arabic at a hospital, or him being super adorkable and learning norweigian to read a book, but my personal favorite story was something on the campaign trail. [Buttigieg acknowledges and learns basic sign language to thank a deaf supporter for his support and for giving him a sign name](https://youtu.be/bOXU_4cRtrI). Deaf people are one of the most overlooked and mistreated minorities in the country. So much of society relies on verbal and auditory cues. Even "successful" deaf people who can read lips are often treated lesser because of the "deaf accent". People might assume stupid it's a bit similar to how stutters are treated which this subreddit should know well.  So people treat you like you're stupid and you feel more reluctant to give your voice which compounds the bad treatment. ASL isn't as prominent a language as it should be imo. But there's a lot of depth to it and an amazing deaf culture around it. Pete went out of his way on a busy schedule to do something that no other candidate to my knowledge has ever done and I'm sure it means a lot.   Pete is the first openly gay person to win a state (even if a certain someone is trying hard to deceive people about the results). His life story in terms of his identity was important to hear as well. His love of Chasten is genuine and beautiful. Even to this day a lot of gay kids are uncomfortable and have unsupportive families. Even those from more progressive families can still feel uneasy acknowledging their true self due to how it might change how others look at them or what they might accomplish. Pete Buttigieg did a lot in breaking some of those glass ceilings. [He inspired at least one little boy to feel comfortable](https://youtu.be/523_8YZj9oI).  I can go on and on but all I got to say is. We will be blessed as a nation if Pete Buttigieg continues down his path. One day he will be president if he wants it, these past days he's really touched a lot of hearts, and in the coming days he will do whatever he can do to make this world a better place.  Thank you Mayor Pete  Gracias Mayor Pete  Merci Beaucoup Mayor Pete  谢谢 Mayor Pete  ありがとうございます Mayor Pete
He’ll be back!
Pete supporter now a Biden supporter!  People are going to be shocked how well Biden does on Tuesday. MANY of us who were supporting other candidates are flocking to him to stop Bernie.
Hey all, just subbed here. Because I know when joe said he respected Pete (and when you guys say it) you all mean it.   Joes got my donations going forward.
Can’t wait to Vote for Pete in 2028!
Pete supporter/volunteer/donor here. Y'all seem like good people. Good on Joe for not groveling 0.002321 seconds after the announcement.
Bernie Bros Leaking Buttigieg Volunteer Group Texts: http://imgur.com/gallery/HUTl76S
RESPECT  In our thoughts, words, and actions we cultivate a sense of respect. ​We respect one another on this team, we respect the office of the Presidency, and we respect every individual we encounter on the campaign trail, including our competitors. ​The better we hold up this value among ourselves, the better it will reflect outside. It will represent a quiet antidote to the idea that this project is too audacious to be taken seriously.  BELONGING  We seek to serve and unify a diverse nation. Let us build a campaign team and a coalition of supporters that kindly embraces and reflects the increasingly diverse party and country to which we belong. We will honor this value not just in our makeup but in our practices, as we proactively work to include people of different backgrounds and viewpoints in every major decision, and cultivate a sense of welcome to all.  TRUTH  Honesty is in our nature, and it is one of our greatest means of restoring faith in our democracy among everyday Americans and building a national movement rooted in trust and faith in our country and our beliefs. Internally and externally, our effort will be characterized by fidelity to the truth.  TEAMWORK  We are all working in service of our country and to elect a President who will represent our values and make American lives better. In moments of disagreement, the temptations of pride and ego will arise. Rooted in our mission, let our common purpose be a touchstone as we foster a climate of trust and mutual respect.  BOLDNESS  We will not hesitate to take bold stances and to accept risk in the defense of our values. Our respect is reserved for people, not for conventions. We accept no truisms without questioning. The spirit of originality will create the pressure and permission for us to do things not done before, to stand out from the crowd not by waving our arms for attention but by the fact of being different.  RESPONSIBILITY  The conduct of a campaign can be as influential as its outcome. Everyone on this team has a responsibility to live up to our values, and every participant, from a first-time volunteer to the candidate and top staff, must model this. When there is a mistake, we take ownership, learn, adjust, and move on. Missteps are inevitable, but they should never be repeated. We own our choices and our work.  SUBSTANCE  There is no point mounting an unorthodox, underdog campaign unless it is one of substance. We have the opportunity to bring meaningful ideas forward for debate. We will take questions seriously and answer them directly. We will lay aside the superficial in favor of the meaningful. We embrace complicated challenges, and will work to improve the overall dialogue in how campaigns talk about policy.  DISCIPLINE  A project like ours will require enormous discipline. Through energy and determination, we will handle our resources with the stewardship they deserve, mindful that this campaign is fueled by the gift of other people’s time, money, relationships, and reputations.  EXCELLENCE  A functioning presidential campaign is such a marvel that we may at times be amazed simply by the fact of what we are doing. But the standard we should hold ourselves to in every part of our work is not whether it is at the level of a presidential campaign, but whether it is at the level we would expect of the best presidential campaign of this time.  JOY  Amid the great challenge we have accepted, let us be joyful. We are privileged to be in the very center of the most important conversation in the world. We are assembling a team of wonderful human beings. Along the way we will all get many opportunities to lift one another up and lift up those we encounter. The American presidential election is the world’s greatest civic and democratic ritual. It will shape us but we can shape it too. Let us shape it, partly, by spreading the joy of working for our beliefs.
Hey friends, thank you for welcoming members of Team Pete. I'm happy to throw my support Biden's way - let's head onward to Super Tuesday and the nomination together!
He would have made a great president and ran a good campaign.  I hope he does well in the future.
I can’t wait to see him for Sec of state or higher position.
Thank you Pete, for actually being willing to call out much of Bernie's and Warren's BS
Hey all, heartbroken Pete supporter here. Someone in the Pete sub linked over to this thread and I just wanted to thank you guys for keeping it so classy and positive, and for not invading our sub to recruit while we're all grieving. This kind of solidarity and respect really does mean so, so much. We've definitely noticed it on the sub.  I vote tomorrow, and I will be happy to cast my vote for Joe.
I was a Pete supporter until the end, but now that he's out, I'm happy to put my support behind Biden!
As someone who jumped ship from Pete a while ago, I think Biden and Pete have more in common than most people think. Biden will surround himself and staff his administration with very smart people like Pete, and then hopefully in 2028 we'll be able to vote for him again. He was a real class act for dropping out when he knew he wasn't viable anymore, and it really shows that he is able to put the well-being of the country over his ego. Here's to the next time you run, Mayor Pete.
The fact that he was a mayor of a city with 100k, he had zero name recognition, financial support, or campaign infrastructure, and managed to win Iowa, and come in a very close second in New Hampshire, shows just how much talent he has as a politician.  I absolutely believe when it comes to pure political talent is is the best we have right now, fortunately for us he's young and hopefully he has a long political career ahead of him. If I were him I would be looking to move to a less red state where I could run for Senate or governor, and preferably a state with black people in it so I could actually start building up some reputation in that community.  I'll be extremely surprised if he isn't the Democratic nominee for president at some point in the next 20 years.
Thank you Mayor Pete for your unwavering support for decency, respect,  and honesty. You Mayor Pete are a fine example of someone that is the embodiment of what it means to be a Democrat.  From your Rules of the Road to your decision to suspend your campaign, you did it all with the American people in mind.  Thank you!   For all the supporters of Mayor Pete that are just lurking or joining us,  welcome! Mayor Pete and Vice President Biden share the same values and vision that brought us here today.  Please feel welcome to post, comment, or just lurk.
He’s a fantastic speaker, very polished. His decision shows that he’s a person who cares about the future of his country. I look forward to seeing how his political career develops.
The hostility, the horrible establishment narration and purity tests have me so sad and frustrated. That's why Pete Buttigieg's compassion, civility and intelligence was like a light in the tunnel. Listening to him speak was a pleasure, he's SO good at it. When I saw what the 'progressive' opposition was throwing at him I was beyond disgusted. I was so happy that he won Iowa and am also happy to see he's a true patriot and believes in his message above everything else unlike many others. I think he'll do great things and I'll be watching. I like him so very much!
Coming from r/Pete_Buttigieg and still a bit heartbroken this morning, but Uncle Joe has my support.  I can't deal with another 4 years of Trump or a world run by Bernie Bros.
As a Pete supporter this made me really happy to read. Thank you for doing this and not infiltrating our groups to push your candidate. It’s noticed and appreciated and makes a difference. Joe isn’t the candidate I envisioned voting for when this all started, but I’ll be happy to vote for him come 3/17. Thank you again for your class and support.
:( 💙💛💙💛
My favorite was Pete. He spoke about issues with such intelligence that is not matched in politics today. We need him in the DNC. If this were any other race, I would have voted for him, but we need Biden now to take out Bernie and Trump.
Pete refugee here. Will be my honor to vote for Joe in California in two days.
Wow, this thread is awesome. I was a mod over at /r/pete_buttigieg, wasn't expecting this. I'm taking some time to breath before I jump in with another candidate, but this was nice to see. Thanks for the kind words.
Pete for VP?
Really dissapointed that he didn't outright say that Pete's followers should smarten up and vote Joe but he insinuated it so I guess that's a plus
I was torn between Pete and Joe.  He made my decision easy today.
Supported Mayor Pete for nearly a year, but Joe Biden has grown on me as this election has progressed. I think Joe is now my favorite candidate.  Thank you for being a respectful subreddit 💙
Whelp, this is my new home for the time being. I’ll still be on Pete’s sub but I bet it’ll be less active. Enough sanders spam will also be frequented
Huge win in SC and then Steyer and Buttigieg dropping out before Super Tuesday. I think it's rebound time for Biden!
Can we get a "Pete Supporter for Joe" flair or something like that?
He just had the biggest rally for a Democratic candidate in the state of Tennessee since Al Gore this weekend. More than double any other candidate this cycle. They had two days to put it together.   I’m happy he got out if he didn’t see it. But damn. I was really curious to see how he did on Tuesday in certain states.
I'm a Pete supporter and will most likely be voting for Biden now because I don't think anyone else has a chance at winning in the general election against Trump. I'm hoping if Biden wins that Mayor Pete gets VP or at least a spot as an ambassador.
Pete supporter here in California. I’m team Biden now. Will do my part on Tuesday!
I was a Pete supporter, but after yesterday it was clear that we need to rally around Joe and made my first $50 donation to the campaign last night after South Carolina. Joe and Dr. Jill have shown grace and humility and I appreciate that them or anybody on here hasn’t been trying to persuade people to come on over like the other campaign I won’t mention. I hope that Pete has a place in a potential Biden Administration
Pete contributor and Biden FEC-maxxer tomorrow morning reporting for duty. Let's kick some socialist and then fascist bootie!
Thanks for being decent and supporting a very decent man. Pete made me believe in the power of politics. He gave (and still gives) me hope. At the beginning of this cycle, I never thought I would end up rooting for Joe. But then along the way people have shown their true colors.
From a Butti-stan, thanks for the kind words. Virginia votes tomorrow; Always respected Biden, and what a great guy he was, and will be proud to be able to cast a vote for him.
I just spoiled my absentee ballot in Michigan for Pete to vote for Biden. Lets win the era together, it’s what Pete would want.   Diamond Joe it is.
I'm a Pete supporter that just subscribed to this subreddit today.  All I can say is thanks!
Former Pete supporter who isn’t old enough to vote yet but will now work hard to make Joe the nominee! He wasn’t my first choice, but I’m confident he will be the best nominee to take on Trump and unify the country!
The Mayor Pete loss hurt, but I've always been a Diamond Joe fan. I'm happy to be coming over to Team Biden with the energy, enthusiasm, and positivity that the Buttigieg campaign instilled in me.  Fellow Pete fans that are over here - let's do this and never forget ROTR!
2022 Senate?  Take that red seat
I haven't had a firm opinion on Pete until today, but I have so much respect for him for making the decision to drop out today. I started out this primary willing to support anybody other than Bernie. Would have especially loved to support a female candidate, but Kamala lost me with her pathetic attack on Biden about bussing and then Gillibrand with the even more pathetic attack about some Op-Ed from 40 years ago. After how selfish every other candidate in the race has turned out to be, it's refreshing being able to trust Pete to actually do what is best for the country.  Also, I watched Chasten introduce Pete for his concession speech and it was the cutest thing I've ever seen. Teared up. Totally on Team Pete for the VP slot or anything else he runs for in the future.
Pete 2028? He'll be a leader for years to come.
Thanks for this, guys. Biden has my vote tomorrow. #PeteforBiden

As a Pete supporter, at first, I was worried that Joe running at his age was a bunch of Malarkey, but once he came out and cleared up once and for all that he was AGAINST Malarkey, that really helped me to unde.......welp I've gone over time so I'll just stop there.
Sometimes I think my life's decisions are hard to make. Then I remember that some guy at Lego had to decide whether or not to give non-white people yellow skin.
Y'all. Diehard #TeamPete here. This is...so nice. I've spent all day with Bros circling like vultures or trolling our groups just for me to click through and get hit in the face with a dozen posts about how Pete is totally getting bribed by Bloomberg or he's definitely a secret CIA agent or whatever the goddamn they're on about today. And I don't even \*LIKE\* Biden, I have a lot (a LOT) of issues with him, I just told myself I'd pass my vote along to whoever Pete trusted, and use it to back up Pete's endorsement. But between this entire....thing, and the quote from Jill Biden earlier about Chasten.....damn, guys, I have been judging y'all wrong. I'm still a sincere and heartfelt "ehhhhh" on Biden, but Biden \*people\*? .......y'all alright.     EDIT: and just so y'all know, this thread has made it to both the Pete subreddit and the Pete facebook groups. You deserve credit for this.
We are the rat army of our lord, Pete, and we are here to devour all Malarkey and make Joe our leader
🥰🏳️‍🌈🤝💎🐊
I was a Pete diehard from the beginning of this race, so I'm sad but I saw this coming. But now I'm full steam ahead for Biden to get the nomination.
[Luria's campaign staff were one of a few reasons I stayed in politics after a humiliating and incredibly stressful campaign gig early in 2018. As someone on the fence between Joe and Liz after losing Pete, this message and her Biden endorsement mean a lot to me re. whom to vote for.](https://twitter.com/ElaineLuriaVA/status/1234541857058607104)
In my heart, Pete is still my top choice. But on paper, I'm going with Joe. Thank you for this kind post, it makes my choice that much more validated.
I am a Pete supporter and was glad to see this here. Thank you.
I’m a Pete supporter still chopping onions 😭 but getting over it.  Pete 2024!  I trust Pete and will vote for Joe in the Kentucky primary on May 19.  Kudos to the Peties who had to flip quickly and vote Joe on Tuesday.  I donated to Joe already but I really need to pay down my credit card 💳 since I maxed out for Pete and have No Regrets!!!  As soon as I become more enthusiastic about Joe, I will start phone and text banking for him.  I really enjoyed phone banking for Pete and it gave me so much hope—-the voters are absolutely committed to unifying behind the nominee and defeating Trump.  They are EAGER to dump Trump!  I’m also supporting Amy McGrath to defeat Mitch McConnell.  For now I am writing ✍️ postcards to voters to get FL Dems to opt into Vote By Mail which doubles voting behavior—-let’s flip FL blue!

My loyalty to Pete is deep and my love is strong. I hope Biden has the foresight to name him as Vice. He would thrash Pence in a debate and let’s face it, he would bring along one hellofa strong grassroots campaign network, something Joe could truly use. I’m holding onto my vote until the last minute in the hopes Joe will pick Pete as VP. We need Pete’s visionary ideas. He is the most visionary moderate we’ve got.
Pete Buttigieg, for the past year you have made my life better. You gave me hope after nearly 3 years of hopelessness. I have watched you change hearts and minds, include the excluded, and spread a message of love and acceptance. We need you, Pete. You and Chasten have made this world a better place. I’ve spent a lot of time in Facebook groups built in your honor, and I can tell you firsthand that you are loved. Thank you.
[removed]
POTUS gets max 8 years. Arguably Pete can only be even better as a candidate in 4 to 12 years That being said.. get the man an important role ASAP.. maybe he can replace Elaine Chao (spelling?)
As a diehard, long-time Pete supporter, Biden's my guy now. No question. Time to end the malarkey.
I'd like to see him try and run for Senate or Governor, although I suppose in Indiana thats a somewhat uphill battle. That being said, I trust in Pete.
Damn - never in a million years did I think I'd be subscribing to a Joe Biden sub, but here I fucking go!
> Pete supporters, please make your new home here!   I have! Not interested in a candidate promoting a paradigm shift, not interested in the incumbent, and I'm not interested in supporting the interests of either of their toxic bases.        Plus, I'd rather have a Biden presidency now and a Butti Presidency in the future.
I’m hoping Joe picks him for VP and if (God forbid) for some reason his health comes into question, we’ll have a capable person ready. And if not then he can run in ‘28.
I’ll be voting for Joe now. Was happy to vote for him for VP twice and will be happy to vote for him for POTUS. Would love to see Pete get a spot in his administration.
As a rock-solid Pete supporter for the past full year, I still do not get the idea that Pete hasn’t the experience necessary to be POTUS.  There have been several prominent presidents in the past with very limited Washington experience—one that immediately comes to mind is Obama—and Pete has said, repeatedly, that the job could be an extrapolation of what he did for eight years, that perhaps someone who successfully brought a city back from the brink is exactly the change we needed, plus, unlike Trump’s dumpster fire, Pete’s plan was always to pick the best, the smartest, the appropriate people to surround and advise him to make the best possible decisions for the American public.  Had to get that rant off my chest, but, that being said, I do not for one minute think that a president Sanders would be able to get anything at all accomplished, going back to Washington with both fists in the air and a grimace on his face, insisting on turning everything inside out... basically what Trump has done.  I can appreciate the respectful relationship I saw for months between Pete and Joe, and Pete’s endorsement didn’t really surprise me, even as far back as New Hampshire, but I’m still not sure I’m even going to the polls next week, now that my guy is out.  I’m 66 years old and have never seen a candidate like Pete, been this energized about politics, or ever donated to or planted yard signs for a candidate for president before.  My health is morphing to the point that I may not be around in eight or twelve years to see Pete run again, so if Biden wins, it would at least be good to see Joe understand how inclusive, wide-reaching, and needed Pete’s Douglass Plan is (I’m an old white fart, by the way), and figure out a way to get Pete to help him implement it.
He knew his polling in most Super Tuesday states were abysmal. Dropping out now lets him save face for a future run
Pete, Biden, Yang and Steyer generally ran the "cleanest" campaigns.
I will always remember how he defended Joe.
And Joe with the "Pete had NDAs" comment. I was laughing so hard.       **We** (Pete supporters) all knew the point Joe was trying to make. But man, Joe, that was near "punching the battered women's issue" level of gaff.       And then Joe's "attempts" to through some shade before the NH primary. Complementing Pete 3 times before spitting out the criticism: "You know, Pete... He's a great guy but... and I am extremely grateful for his service, but... and he's campaigning strong, but... I just don't think he has the experience needed."      Oh, Joe....that's when I knew I liked you as a person, even though I liked Pete more.
I was stuck between Joe and Pete and held off on voting until Tuesday because I knew something like this might happen.   Glad I did, I'll be casting my vote for Joe.
There was no “err” of your ways. You voted who You thought was best. I think you can switch your vote if you early vote and he dropped out before the primary
In most states you can have your ballot canceled so you can vote again.
Hey u/willow_ve ! You and everyone at Team Pete are welcome here! I see that your a mod over at r/pete_buttigieg and any mods of Team Pete are welcome to become part of Team Joe! If you want to be a mod with us over here,  just shoot us a modmail.  We'd be honored for you and any mods there to be part of the team
I do not envy the hard work you’ve had over there with trolls, etc.  I’ll stay subscribed as it has been an excellent subreddit full of excellent people. Thank you!
Thank you so much for making the sub a vibrant place for free discussion. Thank you for all your tireless effort.
Thanks for the work you put in for an amazing American public servant with a bright future
Thank you for all your hard work. With your subs rules of the road you guys were constantly one of the most positive and welcoming spaces on Reddit.
This whole comment made me so happy, thank you.  This whole post and all the comments in here actually are just great and much appreciated.
Thank you for taking the time to write this thoughtful comment. Joe won me over with his amazing victory speech and South Carolina. It's clear his campaign is about kindness and decency and that's what I want in our President.
>One of the reasons people smeared him was because his command of language was too good to be true. But it was true. He could disseminate information and repackage concepts in more palatable ways like an artist.  Exactly. I got so tired of people hitting him for sounding "rehearsed" just because he speaks off-the-cuff better than a lot of politicians on their speechwriter's 5th draft.
He's got a brilliant political career ahead of him!
How right you were! I was very pleasantly surprised!
Pete was my 2nd choice, I sure am glad Joe's worst attack ad on him was just extremely backhanded praise
Still in recovery mode and I don’t vote tomorrow, but I’m leaning this way too. I find this image to be fairly indelible: https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106316718-1577809537528gettyimages-1152457795.jpeg?v=1577809671&w=678&h=381
2022 if he runs for senate in Indiana (which I hope he does)
2024. Joe said he’s one term
Everything I love about Biden, I also see in Pete. This is not to say that Pete is a Biden clone or anything. They're both honest, sincere, brave, hard-working, charismatic, earnest and genuinely care about making America better. They have a track record of making actual progress and their policies are achievable, well thought out and evidence-based. I'm sorry to see him go but cannot wait to vote for him in the future.
Yeah that "join the real fight" made my blood boil.
I'll be shocked when i happen across something from a Bernie supporter that ISNT contemptuous and I would LOVE to be wrong about that but I only ever see the decency when they cross subs to show in places like here that they can be civil. I'm sure it's the most vocal who are the worst but I bet there is a big portion of great folks being done a disservice by this poison. It's shit from TheDonald Sub circa July 2016
Movie poster made by Team Pete for Joe
Beto, don’t touch your face!
Not my work. I found it here - [@WC4Pete](https://twitter.com/wc4pete/status/1236719998002814976?s=21)
I love seeing all the unity.  Another really amazing point during this campaign was when Biden volunteers did the High Hopes dance in honor of Team Pete. This is the love and unity that we've been missing so badly for the past 4 years.
lol didn't notice Obama in the background.
This is awesome
Team Pete outdid themselves with this, I love it <3 very happy to have you guys and gals on board. Lets go beat Trump like a drum 🥁🥁🥁
The number of "comment removed by moderator" comments is ... high...  C'mon people, it's just a fun poster celebrating a new found feeling of unity... unity is a good thing!
Why isn’t it GI Joe??
Not the best resolution for desktop background, but it will work.
Amazing! Pete supporter and now Team Joe here!!
It's too early to put Obama in the background, but this poster is epic.
this is fucking sick   whoever made this has got some talent
Hope we can add Bernie as support on Wednesday. 💙💛
Sweet! That’s really cool! You’re very very talented.   Thank you very much fellow Joe Biden supporter! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
This is just awesome through the roof. The artist is just fantastic.

Oh how I love this.
Bloomberg needs to be back there just stroking a check
I’m glad they included Bloomberg, we need his money and supporters. Love this United blue effort! We need Liz and her supporters too. I really think that would be a game changer if we got warren on side Biden.
Putting Mike Bloomberg on here is a mistake.
I read this as Glue united and I was so confused.
Make one for the other camp: GO HOME
Can we get one without Bloomberg thou
Wow that's pretty good!

Not having Yang in this is like not having Iron Man in the real one. Fail...
Shouldn't you remove Obama since he refuses to endorse Biden?

Oh my god he has AirPods in he can’t hear us
He is smart ebough to have used purel first.
Wash your hands! 😂
Agreed. In 2016 I would have probably rolled my eyes a little and thought it was cheesy but we are so so so desperately in need of hope and goodness these days it makes me cry now.
A bit disappointed that Warren isnt up there, since a large chunk of her support also went to Biden
Video please?
As is always true with the establishment.
Saint Obama. A man too good for this country's sins.
Has Obama even endorsed Joe?  I thought he was staying out of it till there is a single nominee.
[removed]
Well, he avoided the draft so...  Edit for people who don't know: Biden had a student deferment for the draft and was then excluded because of his asthma.  Also, IDGAF, but it's why GO JOE is way better than GI JOE.
He's not a GI?  Unless GI stands for something else I'm not thinking of.
I like Go Joe, it makes me think of this song about another Joe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42NYkjklkWg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42NYkjklkWg)  Hopefully Joe Biden can come out on top like his namesake.
Or Bernie
I just read an interview with Bernie:  >Sanders did, however, pledge his support to Biden if he won the nomination. “We’ve got to do everything possible to defeat Trump. I’ll support Joe if he wins, he’ll support me if I win,” he said.  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/08/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren
She was my original choice for POTUS but, I think Stacy Abrams would be a really good choice for VP.  1. Was almost Georgia's Governor 2. Her main cause nowadays is voter rights 3. From Georgia where there are two senate seats up in November 4. Law degree from Yale. 5. Woman of Color -- doesn't matter to me but it does checks some boxes  How do i get flair on here?
Pete all the way.
Kamala!
he should be replaced with Clyburn
[removed]
Don't count on Sanders, he's going to take it to the convention then run 3rd party. It's his turn.
[removed]
These are the people who have endorsed Joe (minus Obama). That’s why Yang isn’t included - he hasn’t endorsed anyone.
I didn’t make it and he isn’t “refusing” to endorse Biden. He said he wasn’t going to endorse anyone in the primary and would support the eventual nominee and he’s stuck to it.
thats why obama is faded in the background, like he plays a backstory role in a movie
I guess it's just for the candidates that have endorsed him...and Obama.

THE DEEP STATE ALWAYS WINS
I don't think so. I think he'll wait till either Sanders or Biden drops out. But the odds of it being an amazing endorsement are 99/100. The man has a way with words.

“General Issue.” It was a nickname given to US soldiers during the World Wars.
I hope he sticks to that
I'd stan an Abrams pick.   You can change your flair yourself on the sub homepage, tap the three dots in the upper right on mobile
As a Georgian I'm rooting for an Abrams pick. If you've never heard her talk she's simply brilliant. And if Kemp hadn't cheated hard she'd have won.  Seriously, he was in charge of his own election and pulled some seriously shady garbage.
That'd be a good choice. Though literally any other Democrat is a better choice.

Yea as a YangGanger, this is the right move. All eyes are for Biden to strongly consider UBI as a solution to handle the impact of the 4th industrial revolution, and if he does adopt it, Yang would be immediately onboard and endorse Biden.  And it's not like either are slacking; Yang & Biden are having phone calls every now and then discussing this. Most recent one was just early last week.   So yea we gotta give them both time to work things out.
You're right, I didn't mean to imply the wrong thing, just a bad choice of words.  I guess I just disagree with this narrative that Biden is somehow a surrogate for Obama. Vote for Biden if you like Biden. Don't vote for Biden because you liked Obama.
[removed]
I need to check and see if he sells yogurt on his store page.
Of course he will. Biden and Sanders like each other and have both said lots of positive things about each other. It's fine and normal for Sanders to stress their differences while the campaign is still on. Sanders is always clear to stress that he likes and respects Joe. Its his supporters who tend to be less than civil.
Thank you fellow Oregonian!  Primary Election Day is May 19th !
Yup.... as much as I'd like some others as well, Abrams would utterly slay....
I don't think he cares. I'll admit that ever since my 2016 primary vote for him I've grown to loathe the man almost as much as Trump, but I truly do believe he's that narcissistic and to him it doesn't matter if Trump or Biden wins since he believes both sides are the same.  It's going to be a Sanders/Gabbard ticket, his thinking will be that Gabbard will bring in moderates/conservatives who don't care for Trump.  Reminder that Harry Reid had to talk him out of primarying Obama in 2012.
[removed]
UBI is the most libertarian way of addressing social support. I find it funny how Yang straddles different camps with this.
Revenue-neutral carbon tax with per-capita rebate amounts to a UBI...
[removed]
I agree - and I like to show clips of Bernie talking positively about Biden as an example that all the rhetoric is just BS....   I’m told that Bernie is just being diplomatic and he doesn’t really think that. 🙄
Amy supporter from Oregon now Team Biden checking in!

Even if sanders doesn’t like Joe, he likes Trump infinitely less and will act to defeat him.
I certainly hope so. I’ve seen people I know, irl, say they’re not voting Biden because of Shawn King tweets...  🙄

Pete person here. I'll have none of that malarkey!
Still Yang Gang but there's no way I want Bernie. I'm going to vote Biden tomorrow. I'm in California and he needs it.
Oh shit. Guess I'm in the right place.
Got a giggle out of this Pete supporter. Happy to hop over to Team Biden.
You need to add Grit and ROTR.
Biden is genuine. He doesn’t come across as demanding. I don’t know why the pundit rips him during debate all the time. I think if people sees his emotion, they can see this is really a guy doing this for the country. He is not doing this because of ego or pride or he think he has the best answer for everything, he is doing this for this country. That earns my respect.
Flair updated accordingly.
Not even a little as a treat?
Any chance /r/JoeBiden can get a [malarkey level bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/eyzy85/_/fgkgg3y)?
Thank you for being so welcoming!
Do you also have the Malarkey Level bot from r/neoliberal?
It’s beautiful.
Someone needs to make this a t-shirt. I would pay good money for it 😂
💎💎🙌🙌
That was exactly what I hoped it would be.
Gotta have high high hopes for no malarkey!
Yes, GO MAN.  Watch this vid for evidence by an ex-Trump voter turned YangGang, on how Yang & Biden are actually more aligned and closer than you think;  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-SkQDPxUbT8   Your vote for Biden will definitely give hope to Yang as VP or to his cabinet man!!!
Initially I was a malarkey supporter but now I’m fully in the tank for no malarky.   \#malarkeytonomalarky
[removed]
Pete supporter here. I only ever heard him talk at debates before and it gave me a false impression of him, made me think he was "losing it". After hearing the way he spoke after being endorsed by Pete, that completely changed my mind. He clearly is very heartfelt and articulate, I just don't think the debates are the best format to show that.
Flair game on point.
Oooh I want that flair

You mean /r/malarky
Exactly, and I think the debate pundit analysis makes it seem even worse. I feel the pundit are simply too out of touch from the public. I mean, sometime the subtle demeanor and emotion speaks more to people who don’t make a living by speaking in front of a camera all day.   Pete was almost my favorite, really close. What an incredible person.   And I hope Pete will give Biden some tip on the debate. Can’t wait for Pete, as Secretary of State, to logically, analytically, convincingly, compassionately...speaks for the US on the international stage.
Yeah given how the debates weren’t the best to show off Pete’s abilities I’m willing to open my mind that that is true for other candidates as well. Hearing how people who only watched the debates talk about how rehearsed Pete was and knowing they were wrong about him gives me comfort that I may have been wrong about Joe for similar reasons.

Yeah. It picks a random malarkey level and posts the image of that malarkey level to any comment with the words malarkey level in it. So you never know which level you’re going to get.
Put it on the back 🙃
Fair.

The best description of this miraculous campaign so far
But man, imagine what he’d do with a good ground game too.   Local elections are still at stake. Being on the ground is essential.
Here's a more serious, in-depth take on the post-campaign era: https://twitter.com/JYSexton/status/1235049472582758400?s=19  >Biden is winning in states he never stepped foot in, states with no operation or ads he was trailing in recently by a large margin.  >We’re in a post-campaign era. It started in 2016 and is in full bloom now. Contests are determined by media coverage and prevailing narrative.  >...
Our revolution is a completely 100% opaque superpac that is flowing by far the largest amount of "dark money" into the race.
Joe Biden hire me in Michigan challenge.  I’m a literal female college student for Joe 😩
This is the best meme I have seen yet.   Well done.   Genuinely lol’d
Maybe people can realize that it might just be a possible, that the reason Bernie seems only to have a following among the younger voters, is that the older voters, over the past 3 decades, have learned to see through the same old politic nonsense he has been peddling for the past 30 years.
So good
Whenever question about policy detail. Bernie camp frames the question as an immoral/inhuman attack.   Bernie camp makes huge promise on all these things, but if anyone ask how to do it or how to pay for it, he always counter it by either turning the answer into a moral/ethical argument with him on the high horse, or he promise to make the evil billionaire, the 1% or the tenth of 1%, the Wall Street banks, the healthcare industry..etc pay for it.   Now that’s just like what Trump does all the time. He either responded by MAGA or “make Mexico pay for it”.   I mean Bernie is running to get rid of Trump, or is he trying to become Trump.  But Bernie does have a third, less often used, respond. That is “Burn it, burn it all down. We will rise from the ashes. It’s the only way. Burn it all down.”
Bernie: We have to mobilize new voters to come out in record numbers  New voters come out in record numbers to vote for Joe.  Bernie: Wait, not like that!
Without money?

Harder to organize a revolution than it is to offer the security of the status quo I suppose.
How is taking money from various corporations considered "Without money"? The underlying implication also being, Biden has less or no money given to him by his voters.  Last i checked, donors give money to presidential candidates with the expectation of a return. Companies expect policies to be written on their behalf so they recoup and profit. And people? well, a bit of the same right?
Yep. They should hire coalition staffers if they haven't...Lis Smith anyone?
That's one reason why Pete's comms team getting merged in will be a big boost for Joe. Lis helped build a team whose ground game is second to none. They did more with less than virtually anyone in the field.
There's talk of Bloomberg's full operation and resources behind handed over to Biden.
>But man, imagine what he’d do with a good ground game too.  Those words just gave me an orgasm
/r/VoteBlue for all your up-to-date down-ballot needs
He's raised a shit ton of money recently, he'll be fine. He couldn't do much of this before because he didn't have anything to pay people with.
I really think this is super overblown.  Primaries are a lot different than a general.  If we want to win against Trump we are going to need a strong ground game and a sophisticated campaign organization.    Pete should help us a lot in the ground game.  His organization was incredible in Iowa and NH. Hopefully he and Lis come on as advisors to the campaign.    Bloomberg, despite his failures as a candidate, built an incredibly sophisticated campaign.  Like he has done stuff no other candidate has done before.  If he can help Biden build something similar and is willing to throw money at it I REALLY like our odds.
I mean, news and information literally travel at the speed of light now. Ground game definitely helps, but you can get your message out in a wide net without having to do everything in the old fashioned traditional method. Pete proved that and Joe is proving that right now.
There's copious amounts of research about the efficacy of campaign voter outreach. In aggregate, in-person voter outreach can increase turnout by about 3%. Now, and in years past as well. It's not a ton.  That said, many, many, elections are within that margin.
Yeah it’s always funny to me that I am inundated with Bernie on Youtube, reddit and instagram. I can’t recall the last time I saw a Biden ad. Yet Bernie’s the one who’s saying he’s not beholden to commercialism. Please explain the Dua Lipa endorsement.
~~No, this only worked because Biden has built relationships for decades.  It's why Clyburn endorsed him, it's why Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsed him, it's why voters knew him and were comfortable with him.  It's also because  they weren't comfortable with Sanders.  Someone without Biden's resume couldn't have done it and Biden might not have been able to do it if his opponent was different.~~  Edit: apparently I get too serious when I'm tired and I can't take a joke.
Is that last line actually a good thing?
I actually think campaigns still matter.  But for downballot races and in states where organization must be intense because voters demand it (early primary states)  But in large presidential contests? No. Doesn't matter as much.
True and important, just doesn't go well with the joke.
Fact.  Their “list of donors” is entirely voluntary and not validated whatsoever. You can put whatever you like in there, including “Anonymous Anonymous”.  TrAnSpArEnCy
It's a 501(c)(4), not a Super PAC. Just a factual distinction. And [it hasn't spent anything this cycle](https://twitter.com/OurRevolution/status/1234186472313544705). Obviously you could disbelieve that tweet, but they'd be immensely stupid to risk getting caught in a lie like that.
It's a dark money group, not a super PAC. Super PACs have to reveal their donors.
We definitely need our Michigan showing to be strong- i feel that its fairly representative of the rest of the rust belt and should give us some indication of who will be the nominee, but also how democrats will do against trump
I’m a should be in college but dropped out of high school due to chronic anxiety and sleep problems but is getting a G.E.D. guy for Joe. Other young supporters do exist.
Younger voters are not old enough to remember the days of the Soviet Union.
Can you be more specific?  What's an example of the "nonsense"?
Or they'll just make up numbers. Bernie constantly says his M4A plan will cost $30 trillion, but here's the truth:  https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/politics/bernie-sanders-plans-cost-bottom-lines/index.html  >During a CNN town hall Monday he provided a back-of-the-envelope ledger for the costs of most of his programs and how he'd pay for them.  >Even in the **most generous estimation** -- using Sanders' estimates where possible and friendly estimates where he has none -- **his plans add up to at least $50 trillion** in new government spending over 10 years.  For a guy who talks a lot about billionaires, isn't it funny how he's so willing to fudge his own numbers by >$20,000 billion?
He had barely any ground offices in ST states and also spent not too much money on ads
Just 4'000 dollar on ads in California's, but 24% of the vote.
>If I was to say, donate to Bernie as a foreigner, in 100 unit chunks, and it came out in $27 donations, well mathematically I would be from Saudi Arabia.  What? Explain this noise, please. lol
Because grass roots donations must be a conspiracy.  /s
Um, is this a joke I'm not getting? Why would Saudi Arabia back him? He's a threat to their oil exports. Truth is that $27 was just (more or less) his donation average in 2016. His campaign made it the second preset donation option on his site. The first is $2.70. People just go with it.

Biden's Super Tuesday win was against Bloomberg, not funded by Bloomberg.

Look at actual spending numbers. Joe has spent a small fraction of everyone else.
He won ST while running *against* Bloomberg. Stop lying.

We fight for stable progress. Saying that we're about the "status quo" is MALARKEY.
Well - I mean - security starts to look incredible when you’ve had a failed reality tv star public ally mocking people, abusing his office, picking judges because they’re radically pro-life and believe in creationism etc!    Status quo looks like a million miles the right direction!  And also is $15 minimum wage and a public health option and addressing climate change and decriminalizing weed and making community college free really the status quo?
Every viable candidate accepts money from PACs. These are legal and transparently-operated, not started by candidates themselves.   On the other hand, Bernie Sanders himself did start a dark money group named [Our Revolution](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/02/02/bernie-sanders-campaign-dark-money-our-revolution-editorials-debates/4556051002/), which, unlike other PACs, refuses to disclose its donors or amount of donations. (If you're asking "How is this legal?" so is Common Cause, which [filed a formal complaint](https://www.commoncause.org/press-release/common-cause-files-complaint-against-pro-bernie-sanders-group-our-revolution-for-violating-soft-money-ban/) against Our Revolution with the Federal Elections Committee for Sanders violating the "soft money" ban.)

Completely unrelated but I’d kill for Warrens store team to help Joe out. His store needs serious work, there’s not a lot there I want to buy. I wanted everything Warren sold. Better graphics, better ideas, etc.
Pete’s comms team and bloombergs data ops. It’s like a coalition building of campaign staffers too.
Respect
Is that happening during the primary or just after there’s a nominee?
P E T E
can you give examples for what Bloomberg hast done?
Bernie has indeed outspent Biden on Media by almost $20 million, but that's largely because he has much larger funds. Relative to total spending, they've spent around 30% and 20% respectively. Sources: [\[1\]](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/expenditures?id=N00001669) [\[2\]](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/expenditures?id=N00000528)  Another reason you have seen so much more for Bernie and nothing for Biden is probably that both campaigns target more likely voters. For Bernie, that's younger people, and younger people use more social media. Similarly for Biden, he's targeting older people on TV and radio.  As for Dua Lipa, I assume she just likes him? lmao
This post is merely a joke and the link above interesting. I absolutely do not mean to dismiss all the hard work that went into this campaign.  Joe Biden and the campaign staff have maximized every opportunity and made extremely valuable connections in spite of not much money or ground force.
It's neither fundamentally a good thing nor a bad thing. It's just a reality thing.
They matter if you're not a popular former vice president who everyone already knows.
I swear I've seen you on badeconomics
For the sake of the narrative we have to do well in Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Florida. I don't think Florida is going to be a problem though based on the poles and Sanders praising Castro and things like that LOL. But we need to take away from the Sanders campaign The Narrative that he'll win the swing states that the Democrats need to win the general election.
Education can fix that.  P.S. Your username, are you Jewish?
Well, he's had these positions the entire 30 years he has been in Congress. There are two bills he got passed in that time: one renamed a post office and one was a veterans bill.
“You don't know. Nobody knows. This is impossible to predict."
His plans are a bunch of Trumpish magical thinking, except when trump says something crazy his base laughs it off.   When Bernie says something crazy like “I’ll remake our billion dollar heath care system by executive order” his followers believe him.
Our current federal tax....is about 5 trillion a year, and we are spending over 6 trillion.  So for the next 10 years, are we doubling the federal tax.... or are we borrowing 5 trillion every year
That % will keep climbing for many days as late mail-in, provisional and conditional ballots are counted. Joe won CA election day voters by 22%.  There's even a (very) small chance Joe could win CA that way, which is why it hasn't been officially called.  When CA says 100% reporting, that just means 100% of precincts. But those precincts are nowhere near 100% of their late ballots. So Joe's CA numbers will just keep climbing for days after "100%" reporting.
Yeah it’s almost like we just had an election that was interfered with by foreign countries 4 years, but I don’t really remember. It’s almost like Bernie’s name is literally in the Mueller report and on page 17 of the Russian troll farm IRA indictment. I don’t know though, I forgot all about all that. Ancient history now.
Such a strange number, isn’t it? $27? I see a bunch of donation amounts. I see even numbers, multiples of 5 in your article, but nothing that helps me understand the $27 donation amount.  Also, yeah, good point about the oil. Thing is, Bernie ain’t gonna beat Trump. I don’t know about you, but that’s why I’m here on a Biden thread, supporting Biden. Because he actually will win.  Have you noticed that Trump, GOP people, fucking Russian media, etc., want Bernie to win the primary? Cause it’s pretty fucking obvious to me. Probably because they think it’s the easy path to victory.  Remember a couple weeks ago about the Russian meddling in Bernie’s campaign?  If you’re a foreign adversary watching an American election year and you want to get your puppet re-elected, do you benefit by sending a weaker candidate to the general? Fuck yeah you do. Not to mention, Biden represents the same kind of Dems that HRC did. Putin not a fan.
If you would’ve read further on here you would see I addressed that. It still doesn’t excuse the fact that it’s the fucking donation amount. Multiples of 5, even numbers, but $27 is the magic number. Does not make any sense. Still.
Yeah also that

>We fight for staple progress  I'm glad we're not on the wrong side of the office supplies anymore
Its more incremental progress (only part i'd consider criticizing this approach is with climate change).   And that being said we have to remember that the president is not the prime legislator, thats the leaders of congress, of which i hope warren (and to a lesser extent Bernie) will be. Part of me hopes that Biden will generally pass most of what they can get thru.  President is instead the face of the country and takes lead on foreign policy and crisis management (and managing everyday regulatory agencies which should be fixed on day 1 tbh)
Top dollar individual donations ranging from $100-300k.  Sounds like oLiGaRcHs to me.
For the most part its super pacs that people criticize taking money from, not pacs right?
Bloomberg's social media game was on point.  If we can pick and choose the best part of everyone's campaign it would be incredible!
Pete had great store stuff as well. I especially like that he hired the same folks who did the palette design for Obama to design his. Everything Boot Edge Edge had great style. I like to think that Chasten had a lot of input there, considering he's obviously the part of the couple that has style sense. I won't subject you to Pete pants pre-Chasten (just imagine baggy slacks)
Bloomberg's data operation really isn't that great. Analytics is most useful for resource allocation and his strategy was "buy literally  everything you can"
Beto helped deliver Texas, Amy gift wrapped Minnesota for Joe, Pete didn't have a state to deliver since Indiana doesn't come up yet, so instead he just gave them THE POWER OF LIS
Like....immediate
Bloomberg saturated the TV and radio airtime with slick, professional ads.  Sent a lot of nice, rather persuasive mail ads.  Going forward, these huge ad buys can reach a lot of middle Americans.  Especially this year when COV-19 fears will limit door-to-door canvassing and public rallies.
Thanks! Yeah I think it’s just because I’m an older millennial student in a very left university environment. I always considered myself to be progressive. But supporting Buttigiege/Biden/Klobuchar has made me feel very uncool and ‘right’ in my current location.
Sorry if it came off as harsh, it's getting late.
Yea im not really worried about florida. Fully agree, which is why i think michigan will be somewhat indicative of the other states
Yes I am
Education about Scandinavian countries?.
That was a rebuttal of a claim--by a supposedly objective journalist--that his health care plan would cost $60 trillion over ten years. Sanders was politely saying she pulled that number out of her ass.
Yah, how different is that with the good old trump wisdom of “And Mexico will pay for it”  That’s true wisdom, true political wisdom
When did he say that he wants to pass Medicare for All with an executive order?
The thing is this: other countries, *most* advanced nations have a universal healthcare system, and done with less money. So it's disingenuous to say it can't be done. Sure, people can choose *not* to do it, but don't say it can't be done. The problem is people like you who say no.  If that's your stance, fine. Say "We can do Medicare for All but I don't want to." But saying "It's impossible!" is a bullshit stance.
.@AndrewYang is one of the brightest minds there is when it comes to the challenges we face in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I'm honored to have his endorsement — and look forward to working with him to ensure every worker can succeed in the changing 21st-century economy.
Biden actually bringing up Yang's platform? Based. Old dogs can learn new tricks.
Biden has always praised Andrew Yang.
Once Biden declines a 2nd term (unless he doesn't) i'm Yanggang 2024 for sure. I hope he (Yang) gets a cabinet position at least.
Anyone who's a Joe Biden supporter but did not come from the Yang Gang (such as previously supporting Pete/Amy/Liz), please go to Yang's twitter and let him know you guys welcome him now.  He has been assailed non-stop by those toxic Berners and Berner-infected YangGangers calling him terrible insults like "conman", "sellout", "liar", and he's clearly emotionally down from graciously accepting their insults.  Thanks guys!  I just thought it would be great for him to see supporters from other camps that isn't YangGang or Berners, welcoming Andrew to make himself feel better about his endorsement. To make himself feel like he did the right thing in broadening the coalition by hopping onboard the Joeggernaut!
Yang and Biden got dragon energy 🐊🐊
If Yang is VP I’m all in
Yang getting love.
I would put Yang in charge of all the digital national security stuff that is being ignored but really is bigger threat than nuclear war in my opinion. Let Yang be a guide to the Bye-Don team with social media and trade craft in the short term too. He really hacked the primary in my opinion and has talent with social media engineering. And then he can teach me how to open a pdf, Jack.
WELCOME YANG GANG!  Team Pete saved you a seat!
Yang Gang all the way! It's time to get Biden in the house.
Yang for a new Department of the Future.
Get him in the administration!
I started out deeply skeptical of Yang, but he grew on me throughout the campaign. His thoughtfulness, his commitment to policy innovation, his decency, and his willingness to explore bold ideas are all admirable. I'm very happy he's going forward with us.
oh yeah!  yang is  way way more reasonable then most people give him credit for.  he's not crazy/edgy for the sake of it or the optics..unlike some people
Joe is bringing together a coalition of America’s best and brightest to tackle head on the challenges our nation faces. It’s truly beautiful!
Joe needs to include each and every one of these other candidates in his government.
UBI will probably never get implemented in the US, but, I can hope.
Welcome, Yang Gang! I was a Warren supporter, but I’ve happily come over to team Joe! The Biden campaign has room for all of us. Let’s fix America together. :)
I’m gonna vote for him. Because I’m an adult and I understand the concept of immediate harm reduction. But there is nothing exciting about this guy. At all. He’s milquetoast. And the reality is (and we’ll know a lot more about this after the debate) he is slowing down enough that I’m concerned.
[removed]
I love when everyone's surprised that a guy who's been doing this for almost 50 years knows how to be a good politician.  He knows how to win support!
Biden starts wearing the “MATH” pin.
Hope he adopts Yang's plan to establish a department of technology and install none other than yang himself as its secretary.
Hi 👋 I’m Yang Gang 🧢  Yang has said for months that Biden is concerned about the 4th Industrial Revolution and has engaged with Andrew about it. This is not just political signaling, Biden knows what he’s talking about and agrees with Yang on the diagnosis. [Yang talks a little about this in his endorsement.](https://youtu.be/hLA_-IPUxEU)
I thought he was considering running for NYC mayor?
Biden already said he is just running for one term.
Same
As a Yang Gang, literally EVERY camp's supporters have been friendly and respectful, except Bernie's lol thanks for the warmth and consideration though!

I don't think that Yang cares or knows about those issues nearly as much as he cares about the economy and UBI type stuff. He's not a digital security expert.
Ew no
Nope.  Klobuchar, Warren, and Harris have proved they can get things done in the Senate.  Yang and Pete have fresh ideas.  Bernie has had 40 years to prove himself and nothing to show for it.  He’d be a terrible cabinet secretary, spouting about how congress won’t pass his plans and the courts keep overturning anything he does get done.  And he’d be undermining Biden constantly.
Do you honestly think Bernie would even accept a second banana position?  I don't see it happening.
I think Sanders and Warren like the Senate.  They were running to be President and if they aren't President then there's things to do in the Senate that are just as important.  I don't know about Booker, Klobuchar, Harris, Gillibrand and Bennet, but they might like the Senate too.
Most of them are already in the federal government.
Eh I don’t see it in the near future, especially in a period where we’re at full employment. It will take a backseat to worker retraining programs etc.  But even Milton Friedman was in favor of what he called a “negative income tax” which, though utilizing different delivery mechanisms, is effectively quite similar to UBI.
Clinton actually was considering it back in 2016, but it wasn't the right time to run on it. She basically needed what Yang has done, which is introduce it into the public discussion so it's not a completely new idea during an election -- basically what Sanders did for M4A in 2016 so now it's being debated seriously.  Now imagine what happens if we get a cash stimulus for the coronavirus. We've got UBI in the public consciousness plus a bunch of cash going out to everyone and people might start to want that money every month.
well, yang is indeed very intelligent.  He was getting near perfect scores on standardized tests and someone said his iq is around 150
I've been so focused on doing everything possible to win this freaking election that I haven't had time to really look at Biden as a candidate. His speech last night made me feel genuine admiration for him.
[removed]
Ok but wouldn't that be adorable
that would be great, or labor
I'm still holding hope Yang gets a VP spot. I think it'd be strategically perfect tbh  If that's not possible then yeah
Same!! Or director of the office of science and technology which already exists but has been stripped because of trump
As a New Yorker I am *really* hoping he runs for Mayor here
Perfect springboard for POTUS, the nyc mayor race is 2021, 3 years before the election
He considered it. And he decided against it. At least for now
The Gang was considering it and then people thought that meant Yang was considering it.
Has he really?
A lot of voters know it. It’s why his VP pick is so important to a lot of people. Whoever he picks as VP will most likely be the nominee, and hopefully #47 after that.
Haha, I am also a YangGang too! If you checked my account history...  &#x200B;  Now hoping for Yang to be VP! C'mon Joe!
That's a good point. I do not know enough about UBI and the economy stuff to speculate. I was just thinking as someone who does not follow him closely that he is one of the few at that level who knows enough about technology to be an effective leader for a digital national security team and it would bolster his resume especially if he is considering a future in higher office.
Bernie's successes have been in championing causes, such as medicare for all and climate change and debt relief. I agree that tactically he's not effective and his strategy for how to achieve these goals isn't good, but the objectives are good. At very least there should be participation with the Bernie people about the platform. The public option can go further, the 2050 date for carbon neutrality can be moved up, Biden can move towards marijuana legalization rather than just decriminalization, debt relief and public university tuition wavers can be extended, etc.
[removed]
I know what you mean, every time Biden starts talking it's like we're going on a verbal adventure, but sometimes the destination is really nice!
It's not productive right now to focus on what you don't like about Bernie supporters.  Focus on what you can do to bring them along in the board coalition that's being built to defeat Trump.
He'd be inagurated as mayor in 2022. It seems a bit much to get elected, serve for a couple months and then start campaigning again
It worked out so well for both the ones that tried this year!
https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129 Can you blame him? He's 77.
Biden at least has a history of embracing new information, even seeking it out. That alone makes him vastly superior imo to bernie, because you can't just pick an idea and double down on it for decades while the world changes around you.
We tried that in 2016.  Hillary’s general election platform was moved to the left.  They still rose against us this year.  Biden’s platform is already more progressive that Hillary’s, and it’s viable with a split congress.  Also remember that we have to convince true centrists and moderate Republicans to vote our way in November.  Appearing too far left could sway them to Trump, abstention, or voting libertarian.
[removed]
> verbal adventure  That's accurate as hell
Trump and Biden both have a tendency to spew out a garbled mess of words. The key difference is the spirit of those words.
Giuluani in the past, too.
Not at all, I love Biden but I’m glad he would retire
Well, this isn't confirmed. Apparently his campaign did research that showed it'd hurt him in the general if he made this pledge, so we won't hear him make it until a bit into his term.
This rumor needs to stop.    Biden [did not say that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1099766), and will not say that, because it would turn him (if President) effectively into a lame duck.
Correct.  In fact, Yang himself said that Biden was the closest to him in the campaign trail; and promised to call Yang if Biden is the nominee.  And both have been calling each other every week it seems, to talk about the 4th industrial revolution. Something which Bernie has never mentioned. So here we are with some salty YangGangers and many Bernie bros on why Yang endorsed Biden.  It's not just the delegate math and Yang's desire to quickly unify the party; it's also because unlike crazy Bernie, Joe has taken much more effort in engaging Yang.  Yea Joe may not be onboard with UBI yet, but that doesn't mean he won't ever will. Former top Obama economics advisor Jason Furman recently came out in support of UBI, and Jason has worked with both Joe and Obama before. So overtime, the case for Joe adopting UBI grows stronger and stronger.  Heck, even AOC, who previously called UBI a "trojan horse", now endorsed UBI hours ago in light of the coronavirus. Lol.
> We tried that in 2016. Hillary’s general election platform was moved to the left. They still rose against us this year.   Yep. *And* they got a seat at the table for changing the rules for the 2020 primary. We still got accused of being 'corrupt status quo establishment' regardless. We still got accused of not offering them anything. This is why we should never negotiate with radicals, especially those whose appeal relies on attacking others and playing victim.
[removed]
Same with McCain, they were discussing if he should make a one term pledge and decided it would do more harm than good.  Personally, I don't mind someone who wants just one term, there's a lot that can be done in four years.  But some people view that as quitting or not trying hard enough.
In McCain’s case, we now know he could’ve done 2 terms. Who knows?
Though the stress of being a Senator is far less than the stress of being president.
The Biden Record
He really did wreck Paul Ryan.
But did he name a rural post office?  Checkmate Biden.
Thanks for reminding Reddit that Biden absolutely wiped the floor with Paul Ryan, who at the time was a young, charismatic congressman.   I think he will fare fine against Trump.
\#facts Also Destroyed Rudy...

Link to him killing Paul Ryan?
I like how it's 8 legislative actions and then just   "ended a man's entire career"
It is great to see an encapsulation of Biden's many legislative accomplishments! I apologize for my fellow Bernie supporters for using Biden's past stances on social security without regard to context and awareness of Joe's progressive approach to it in his current platform.
Diamonds are forever 😎🍦
That's my man, getting good stuff done, my man
I think that was the last time I watched a VP debate. He destroyed Palin too.
Needs gay marriage :) 🌈
This is why we vote for uncle Joe
*Grumbles in originalism*
b...b...but he changed his mind on an extremely controversial social topic, ONCE! \*sweeps Bernie's Brady Bill vote under the rug\*
You forgot “preceded Obama in favoring the legalization of gay marriage”.
All those achievements and nothing about how he had a mullet throughout the 80s.  SMH
Detroit feels that to this day.
And then the bernie people say his record is bad. Seems like the only establishment bernie wont go up against is the gun one. What a HYPOCRITE.
I think it's fair to also bring up that, yes, in the past he was against abortion, the crime bill did turn out to be very bad for the black community, and he was not in favor of gay marriage. I genuinely don't understand how people can say "20 years ago this candidate was for a bad thing, and then 10 years ago he started being for a good thing. How can we trust them?".
Conveniently left out the bankruptcy bill.
Can he remember any of this?
So how'd things go in Detroit, anyhow? Haven't really heard any news since the Robocop statue.
Is Biden pro universal healthcare?  If not, he will never get my precious vote
Not here to start fights and understand that the main thing we have to do is beat trump, but does Biden have any policy for the future that excites any of you? I’m having trouble with it and think that he isn’t bringing anything new to the table to excite voters. Like legalized weed, if he had that at least, something.....idk.
I was a republican back then. That debate was the point I knew how that election would end.  Dude got eaten alive with fava beans and a delightful chianti
(Almost) The whole time, he looked like he was having fun. The guy’s best line, “that’s a bunch of malarkey” gave the word a comeback.
Anyone have a link to this debate? I wasn’t into politics back then and not sure what this is referring to.
It’s striking to see just how recently he was on top of his game also. 8 years is a long time
Better. He got an Amtrak station named after him. Then unveiled the new Alstom Avelia Liberty train sets.
That would be hard in DE.
The “intellectual” of the GOP at the time. Good grief was that a low bar to be branded with by them...
meanwhile paul ryan just recently moved back to dc, after hating on all of us that live here.  he clearly sees the writing on the wall, that joe will be president, and probably wants to set up some "post-trump" gop movement. bring it pauly.
Possibly one of the greatest burns in politics of all time
And the thing is, he stuttered in this debate and it counted for nothing
If you think people questioning Joe’s cognitive decline is bad now, wait for the general. He’ll be in more of the spotlight for longer. Every gaffe or even stutter will be mocked. For years, Democrats have made note of Trump’s mental state, don’t think for one second that it won’t happen to Joe. It’ll be disgusting
This scene from the debate about Libya is pretty good: [https://youtu.be/zAUYy\_ioydk?t=64](https://youtu.be/zAUYy_ioydk?t=64)  Iran part: [https://youtu.be/eaU3\_wHDGug?t=133](https://youtu.be/eaU3_wHDGug?t=133)  On the stimulus (and Ryan asking for funds): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC848UA04bQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LC848UA04bQ)  Compilation of Biden laughing at him: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrAGMFjW6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnrAGMFjW6s)
2012 VP debate!
Bernie Sanders on [guns](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/bernie-sanders-guns/607090/). Bernie Sanders on same-sex [marriage](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/sanders-has-evolved-same-sex-marriage-too-n454081). Bernie Sanders on [immigration](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/25/21143931/bernie-sanders-immigration-record-explained). Sanders isn't some pristine ideologue who has held the same position for 40 years, fighting the good fights. He's a flawed human being doing what he thought was right, just like most other candidates. The difference is that he's the candidate running on the purity.
A person can evolve over time. If you grewup before the 2000's being gay was not accepted like it is today. As you gain more experience and hopefully knowledge your stance on something like gay marriage can change. You can be cynical and say all position changes are for political purposes and maybe some are but look at your own beliefs and think how they change and evolve over time. Not saying that is where Biden's change of heart came from just something to think about
As the others said below me. Keep in mind, he also represented very Catholic Delaware for a long time.....Also, he's been for abortion, even if he hasn't always had the greatest record, for decades.....  And yeah, the crime bill was absolutely problematic. It was also supported by most of the CBC at the time and had fairly widespread support. Same with gay marriage—Obama was against it, and there's even records of Bernie saying he thought Civil Unions were fine. Believe it or not, being pro gay marriage was considered a death sentence for most politicians outside California up until around 2000...and even then most of the Democratic candidates for president weren't in favor of it (nor senators) until 2010. Joe, ironically, went from being against it to one of the major figures for it before many other big name politicians.
Universal healthcare and M4A are not synonymous
Yes. And it’ll actually pass too, so uncovered americans will get covered ASAP. https://joebiden.com/healthcare/
Yes
Yes. Expanding healthcare in a way that will get through Congress and cover uninured Americans excites me very much. Also, Biden’s policy on immigration excites me. I’m sick of the tone that immigrants aren’t welcome here. I know these aren’t the sexiest issues, but it excites me to think of a President who has genuine empathy for those being f’d over by the current administration and is trying to change that.  Edit: Forgot the big one: Biden’s plan to create 10 million jobs in the renewable energy space. It revitalizes the industrial Midwest and helps with climate change. I think that’s pretty exciting.
I'm actually really excited about his plan for post-secondary education - it's so in depth and multi-layered, you can tell a lot of research went into it to make sure it was as comprehensive as possible while also being feasible. They also link to a lot of the studies they use to justify their plan. I really do think community college is a really valuable path for those who may otherwise struggle to pay for college, and the investment into that I think is a major step towards expanding education for the future  It's honestly really enthrilling to see such comprehensive, thought-out plans. Most of the other candidates had talked vaguely about their plans or the reasons why they work, for Biden's plan you can actually follow along with every part of every policy and that level of intricacy to me shows actual care in ensuring the best for the American people
I think that's about when I started coming around to being Democrat. Just fucking trounced Ryan.
It was the most beautiful thing we had ever seen on our side. Paul Ryan was supposed to be the Pete Buttigieg of republicans but was destroyed like he was a minor annoyance for Joe.
Yeah, but I bet he's never complimented a dictator's education system before, so there!
Leave Wilmington and head south.  Most of the state is rural.
And honestly, I wish he'd use the same line on the Bernie.   "A noun, a verb, and 'the billionaires'"
Well, Vermont Jesus wasn't running then.
there is not a single clip of biden speaking that is even 1% as bad as literally anything trump has done in the past 4 years.  besides the fact almost every specialist would attribute the long, consistent patterns linked to a stutter. but if that doesn't work, let the bloombito money play a goofy biden gaffe in comparison to actual trump dementia with neurologists from johns hopkins, mayo clinic, etc pointing out the mental and psychical signs of trump's case.
this is a serious question,and I mean no offence by this, but do you *not* think he's cognitively declining? gaffes and stutters are one thing, and every candidate has them, but I've been watching a lot of videos of Joe recently, and he has trouble answering basic questions and forming full sentences
Clicks first link, unmutes, immediately "THATS A BUNCH OF MALARKEY."  ahhh, there he is, uncle joe
Yeah, how Paul Ryan even had the will to live after debating Joe is beyond me.
All of these old debates I see never have an audience. Is it just because they’re presidential debates? The audience on the debates these days is horrible and it would be so much better without them.
[removed]
You know, I just noticed my comment here was being downvoted. I was agreeing with you... I thought this post was a rebuttal to Sanders supporters saying that Sanders was right all along, by pointing to when Biden was right. I was simply saying that, regardless, even if he was wrong before, he has changed his ways.
Well I hope so.
Could you link me to his immigration policy? Thanks!
It didn’t help that Ryan was supposed to be the GOP’s wunderkind with this brilliant policy wonk mind. And he got destroyed by Uncle Joe.
iirc and its been years since I've seen it but after a point he was just openly laughing at him, too, it was *vicious*
[removed]
Isn’t the largest town in the southern part named Seaford but is like as far from the sea as you can get in Southern Delaware?
I don't think that'd have the impact you think it would. A significant portion of the block of potential Democratic voters are class conscious and this would be seen as mocking one of the two candidates that seriously discussed this issue.  It also sets Biden up to get railed on for the positions he's had which negatively impacted the middle class.
>Vermont Jesus  Fucking lol
Come on, now. ROTR.
And while I agree with you totally here. Trump’s supporters and low information voters won’t see those clips. They’ll see Trump and Fox News mock Joe and they’ll hop on the bandwagon
Oh, I think he is absolutely cognitively declining. He's essentially been in hiding these last two weeks, since all the moderates coalesced around him. The next debate is catered toward him not needing to go head to head with Bernie, they'll probably give him the questions in advance like they did for Hillary in 2016. If he ends up debating Trump instead of continuing to hide, he'll probably fall apart or threaten to fight Trump like he threatened someone asking about gun rights recently.
No, in fact he has his characteristic stutter many times before he delivers his excellent rebuttals to Ryan.   If you think he had some big decline that just reflects poorly on the other Candidates because he was regarded as one of the too performers in the last two debates (in this Dem Primary season)
He’s had similar speech problems for his entire life. It never stopped him from delivering a strong debate performance in the past, and I don’t expect it to stop him from beating Trump.
Not sure who downvoted you, but it wasn't me :) If you hang out on here, though, you'll see nearly all posts are downvoted to the point they get hidden...pretty sure we all know who does it (sigh).
Me too brother, me too.
Sure! https://joebiden.com/immigration/
That's the sad part: Ryan WAS the GOP's wunderkind brilliant policy wonk. He was the best they had to offer.
I began openly laughing at Paul Ryan when GQ interviewed him and he said his favorite band was Rage Against The Machine.  Imagine being that unaware that you are the very thing your favorite band hates.
> Vote third party  Sorry, not a dumbass 🤷🏼‍♂️
>And under Democrat and Republican rule you have watched the cost of living reach shameful numbers..., buuuut thank god billionaires pay a lesser tax rate than anyone on this subreddit.  Well, except Joe Biden that is.  And yet, you think the democrats or republicans are a viable option?   Vote third party, make em earn ur vote  Sorry, I don't take political advice from people who can't even make the effort to use correct spelling.
You should definitely vote third party. And go join a third party and leave our party alone, ‘Kay?
I live in Seaford and you are correct, we are probably the largest town in Southern, DE. We are about an hour east of the ocean but we are on the Nanticoke River that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. And also pretty much everything south of Middletown, is rural, small towns and coastal communities.
glad realistic conjecture isn't downvoted tf here.  joe's running on positive stuff so far too, which is relieving, so there's no need to make bernie look ridiculous without propping up himself. shitting on trump is welcome tho.
okay now I understand better. why are they catering the debate to him?? do most people understand how unfair that is?
[removed]
Oh... that didn't cross my mind. That would be dirty.
That’s certainly a way to win more votes?
I’m really not trying to be a jerk, but aren’t you west of the ocean?
There is a Seaford on LI too!  What a great name for a town!!!
> positive stuff so far too, which is relieving  That's really only true from a certain point of view. Most of the negative talking points are put out by surrogates or other campaign proxies rather than the Vice President himself.   A significant problem with trying to run as a centrist is that in of itself centrism is not motivating and Biden personally isn't really someone I'd call a progressive. This means that in order for a centrist strategy to work the positions of the other candidate have to be attacked or otherwise be made to look ridiculous. Hence, you get Hilary Rosen trying renew the white washing of MLK's legacy on television during an exchange with a black woman by expressing an opinion of MLK's work that suggests it's been a few decades since Hilary Rosen actually *read* the letter if she wasn't being completely dishonest.  However for at least a couple of major left wing issues or positions we seem to enjoy ignoring the historic stances that our older politicians have had on them -- historic often meaning 2009. Watching Clinton trying to avoid explaining whether or not pre-2010ish she didn't believe that gay folks should have rights or whether she just had that position because it was a public necessity was painful. Watching Vice President Biden do the same for abortion, gay marriage, or a variety of other positions is going to be rough too.   For issues like a single payer or other universal healthcare system most folks probably aren't aware that Biden has historically not attempted to legislate anything beyond an insurance mandate and even signed on to the 1993 bill that the GOP put forward with an insurance mandate to serve as a counter to the Clinton administration's universal healthcare push. For the ACA single payer didn't even make it to the floor for a debate.  So as a youngish progressive I'm sitting here watching a front runner shit all over the universal single payer position that has been the bread and butter of the Democratic Party for more than thirty years while heaping praise on what was literally the GOP plan with a few tweaks and talking about how great the GOP plan is, and that we should just accept that bullshit inefficient half measure.  That's not very inspiring.  Add to it this notion that he seems to think unionists enjoy negotiating their wages against their healthcare (Here's a hint, we don't -- but some unions provide health insurance through their union membership, so those union's like it) has the real potential to sour a lot of the interactions with union leaders and activists.   And god forbid Biden keeps suggesting even the remote god damn possibility of a candidate in his 70s nominating a Republican for Vice President. The idea of spending a few months trying to do everything I can to help win an election to literally just give the Presidency to a "moderate" Republican is a harder hill to climb than just saying fuck it and voting for Trump.  Biden himself, personally, is also out of touch with a lot of the experiences that millennials have had and stands to lose voters or at least voter enthusiasm every time he talks about policy related to their economic standing.   Dude was able to work his way through college with a summer job on the weekends his dad hooked him up with that let him spend part of his weekend trespassing at a private club on the beach.   I don't think he understands the impact of policies he literally supported that shifted a significant portion of the overall cost of college education from the public to individual students over the last 20 years and children all went to private universities. It also doesn't help that none of his children have had traditional career paths.  Combine this with the fact that most of the younger folks within his senior staff circles are from upper middle class or better families and were late 2nd term Obama white house staff or low level appointees largely from the Northeast and you have the real potential to run a campaign that is an absolute disaster when it comes to appealing to the largest block of potential voters in the United States.  One of the most frustrating things about Biden's campaign is the direction they went with the message of the campaign doesn't actually play to Biden's strengths and turns a lot of his history into a liability instead of a part of the narrative.   But this is coming from a guy who spent the better part of a decade expecting to be working for Beau's presidential campaign in 2020.
I don't think most people connect that they're catering it to him. It is unfair. And I think some Biden supporters just want to see him win and see any questions or criticisms from Bernie supporters as an attack on Biden that will hurt him in the general. I disagree about that, I think more exposure and questioning results in the strongest candidate because they're ready for the onslaught they'll see in the general. I don't think Joe is ready for doing this in the general.
Of course not. A debate against trump isn’t about substance or policy, it’s about poking jabs at the administration and being charismatic, things Biden still excels at.   A debate against Bernie would literally come down to Trump calling him a communist until Bernie gets red in the face. I don’t think you realize how hard it would to convince Americans who lived through the Cold War and Red Scare to vote for a socialist. It would be a massacre.
No one cares who you vote for. We’re good without you. Bye.
😂 yep, that would be west🤦‍♀️
this is such a ridiculous effort.  please just vote against trump.
[removed]
excellent points, and this sucks lol. whether or not my choice of candidate won, I would want the *best* candidate to win, so to see that they really are rigging the debate in this way is disheartening as hell
Uhhhh last I checked, the democrats lost to Donald Trump......  you losers need every vote u can get...  lol 😂
Well yeah, I'm going to vote for the Democratic nominee but I'm not thrilled with a candidate who has flirted with the idea of putting a Republican on the ballot as the Democratic nominee for VP.   I don't think you're taking the time to consider the extent to which sticking a member of the GOP on the ballot is s assault on the core of the Democratic party.
>  As in my vote is valuable, and if u want it, earn it.  If you want to throw it away to promote Trump, then it isn't valuable at all. It is up to you, 4 more years of Trump and his harmful policies or not.
Not yours. No one is interested. See ya.
Mike Bloomberg Drops Out of 2020 Race, Endorses Biden
Reminder: Do not go to the Bloomberg subreddit to troll his supporters or try to poach their votes. They're capable of making up their minds on their own time. Rules of the road, folks.
This last week has been the wildest roller coaster ride that American politics has seen in decades.
Even multi billionaires can see the problems in their campaign and take decisive actions. Bloomberg could have said fuck democratic party and kept on going, like Bernie did in 2016 primaries.
💎🐊 Joementum! 🐊💎
Excellent news. Centrists unite!!!
Bloomberg's going to bring funds and sway (especially in NY).  Pete brings energized voters and great grassroots organizing.  Amy brought Minnesota.  Beto brought Texas, and surely will win over some gun reform activists.  This campaign such a joint effort and I love it.
Former Bloomberg supporter here and glad to move on to Joe!
I hope he gives Biden a big fat blank check.
Former Bloomberg supporter here.  We have a heck of a battle ahead of us, but I'm proud to be fighting in the war against malarkey.  Biden 2020!!
I hope the Bloomberg team keeps running their amazing targeted ad campaign with a focus on attacking Trump.
Imagine what this campaign can do with Bloomberg money!
That's huge. Biden has this locked down now.
Most of the Bloomberg supporters I know, including my husband and his grandpa, supported him strategically as a well of resources  who would work towards our common goal of toppling trump.   Many of my local politicians supported Bloomberg for the same reason. While I didn’t agree with them (or my husband) and saw Bloomberg as a slippery slope to buying out the party, I can appreciate the sentiment of operating from a strategic perspective to win the election and protecting judicial and down ballot Democratic seats at any cost.
I actually had more respect for Bloomburg than Steyer. As far as billionaires go at least Mike got votes before and could run a campaign. While I think the issues with his candicy could have been correctable, skipping over the vetting process ultimately was a bad mistake and I'm glad to see the Democratic party reject the idea of someone buying a primary.   I'm going to take Mike at his word that he means well and wants to beat Trump.
Best. Week. Ever!
Honestly, I know Bloomberg isn’t popular, and I don’t like him either, but I think he did accomplish something here - he woke the Biden campaign up. His entire candidacy was based on Joe being too a weak of a campaigner to carry the moderate flag, and let’s be real he kind of was early on.   Now let’s enjoy his money, and even more importantly his incredibly talented and well paid campaign staff. We got this.
Thank you Jesus!
I have to imagine Biden and his team are laughing at every turn. It ain't over by a long shot, but things have come together so perfectly for him in the last week.
Excellent news.
[OH, WHAT A DAY! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!](https://imgur.com/ngdaTa3)  I'm ridin' with Biden!
I didn't hate Bloomberg like a lot of others. I think he actually would have been a decent foil to Trump. He just had some deep, deep flaws that made bringing along anyone in the social justice movement extremely difficult.
We cant keep on winning lmao
Good for him. This too will enrage Sanders.
Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe!  What a week!!
Excellent.  Hopefully Warren will stay in the race to draw off votes from Sanders.
Better late than never
Former Mike supporter here. Since Mike dropped out, it’s only logical that the best path forward for america is to support Joe. Bernie is the most dangerous presidential candidate in the history of presidential candidates. He must be stopped at all costs, so I’m all in for supporting you guys!
Jezus, I'm amazed that r/Biden can get on r/popular on this pro Bernie hive mind site.
*happy dance
Give thanks to Warren for ending his campaign. The money and infrastructure he's about to give Joe Biden is a massive deal.
[removed]
[removed]
Okay, now looking at 538, how are the odds of no one winning a majority still so high? Are the delegates already won really that much to have that influence?
[removed]
UNITY!!
... and donates 500 million to Biden’s campaign? Maybe?
This is great. Of course, everyone wanted to really see what they’re campaign had accomplished by testing it on Super Tuesday. Looking at the California primary results shows that bernie was never as strong a candidate as ppl had thought. No Bloomberg and biden would have won with some room to spare.  Respect to Bloomberg for taking the L. This is great news, soon enough we’ll have some of the warren voters too 🤙
And now for all the "Hi, I'm Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden is running for President" ads.
Bloomberg might have taken some votes from Biden, but in the end he served a lightning rod to keep Bernie and Warren from only attacking Joe in the debates.   &#x200B;  I'm sure he was also behind the whole Bernie vs Warren drama that the media baited Warren into falling. She sure is easy to bait.
which Biden did he endorse?
Dementia
Its the dems coming together to take their party back
We were NOT going to get Trumped by a bloody populist
Bloomberg is a true Democrat.  He always liked Biden.  He entered because it looked like Biden had faltered.
Bernie campaigned for Hillary Clinton after dropping out of the race...
And pragmatic progressives :)
Not me, us
It's exactly what we need to do to win over the white house, Congress, and then actually get some good policies enacted. We can do it!
Hopefully Pete can ensure Indiana as well.
Welcome! Bloomberg proved today that he is a man of his word. Like Pete and Amy, he's willing to put country/party over himself.
Unity and solidarity. That’s what I felt when I switched to Joe after Pete dropped out. You’re in a good place.
Mike Bloomberg deserves a lot of credit for running a clean campaign. No smears, just issues and focus on defeating Trump.   Doni Boy tried to make fun of Bloomberg for his height but who's got a bigger heart and who's got a bigger butt?
Bloomberg has dropped out but his ad team will carry on!   Biden/Bloomberg's ad team 2020!
Welcome and thank you for stopping by to share your support! :D
[deleted]
Sounds like he probably will. He said he would run ads for the Dem nominee.
He's also got big time access to high quality data analytics.
Doubtful.  Like him or not, he knows how to organize.  His business is built on data aggregation.  You don't want just his wallet, you want him *and* his wallet.
All of the Bloomberg staff now work for Bernie.
Welcome! There's lots of "formers" here, like me, a former (and future) Pete supporter :)
Bloomberg's trolling of Trump is pretty entertaining.
Frankly, part of me wants him to double down on Joe and launch attack ads against Bernie. It could very well backfire, but I don't see Bernie beating Trump anyway.
Well they can’t coordinate. So Bloomberg can also really fk up the messaging too when he doesn’t know what the Biden camp wants.  MSNBC was suggesting last night Bloomberg continue the takedown of Trump, letting Biden focus on a more positive message of Biden for America.   I am all about that split though.
that's the exact thinking that Bernie had after Nevada. Don't get overconfident. All that happened yesterday was that the party coalesced around Biden. There's still many states in which Sanders could do very well, and if there's no delegate majority, anything could happen in Milwaukee.
Don't jinx us. He has momentum. He has a lead. By no means is it over ...
No.  It still needs to be earned, and Bernie is still formidable.
Absolutely not. We've got work to do yet
I honestly hadn't understood Bloomberg's supporters, and honestly, that makes sense.  Thanks for the explanation.  And welcome (to your husband and his grandpa) to the coalition!
I still don't know what to make of Steyer. He seems like his heart was in the right place and was genuinely alarmed by Trump.   IMHO America didn't need another billionaire political neophyte in the white house. In the end at least Steyer knew when it was time to quit.
I think his first name is Mike not Jesus.
I don't think Warren and Sanders votes are interchangeable.  I think when Warren finally gives in a lot of her people will end up here.

They said last night they'd update it this afternoon.
It’s not being updated until the the official delegate counts are more clear.   It’s obviously going to change now and Biden’s going to cross the majority line.  Because part of the old model had Bloomberg winning 500+ delegates and that’s not going to happen and they’ll go to Joe.

Bloomberg really woke the democrats up. I think Pete's message of not wanting to wake up today with only Mike and Bernie left really resounded.
Something the GOP failed to do.
Damn straight, DINO candidates can GTFO
From whom?
I find it offensive that progressives arent considered "part of the party". Its sizable wing and if you want us to not vote Democrat then that's the way to do it.
Take their party back from who?
I wouldn't go that far. He just doesn't like Trump, which is fair.
> Bloomberg is a true Democrat  Except for that 12 years when he was republican or independent lol
Bloomberg just become a Democrat in 2018. No need to turn him into hero, even though we are happy with the decision he is making.
Months and months after he was already mathematically eliminated from winning a majority of the delegates. He stayed in and fucked Clinton over for months and he only dropped out and endorsed when he realized he wasn’t going to be able to get the superdelegates to overturn the will of the Democratic Party.
We're here! Don't forget about us!!! 😘
That's true!
Haha.  That’s brutal.
That might be a bit of a stretch, but maybe if he's the vp pick?
Donnie might wish he hadn’t attacked Mike when the ninth richest person in the world makes it his personal mission to make sure you lose your job.   We’ve got our troops in line.  Now Mike’s going to make sure we’re properly equipped and ready for war come November.
Bloomberg was one of the best mayors NYC ever had and made it a much more livable place. He increased life expectancy, improved schools, made sure crime stayed down, actively helped minorities (I know stop and frisk was a mistake, but he’s done plenty other things too) by standing for religious freedom to build whatever place of worship wherever in the city, promoted equal opportunity for school entrance exams, and built a lot of parks and bike lanes for public infrastructure. He’s also a leader in fighting obesity, smoking, and gun violence. Compared to Trump, much more competent in the private sector as well, particularly with finance and software.   Joe Biden, while I don’t think is as great as Bloomberg, I do think is still practical and experienced as he was Obama’s VP and helped pass many of Obama’s policies including things like the legalization of LGBT marriage and passing the Affordable Care Act Also, I’m a big fan of free trade deals too.  I don’t support Sanders as much because he is an idealist rather than a pragmatist. He’s frequently shown to be unwilling to compromise and while I do agree with some of his goals, I don’t like his methods. I don’t like the idea of equity transfers, nationwide rent control, and wealth taxes becoming normalized. He’s also a protectionist and historically was against immigration and gun control until it was politically convenient to be in favor.
oh wow, I didn't know he'd do that.  That would really be a show of solidarity if he did.
Source?
Did you mean Biden
If it's going after Bernie's policies, sure. Attacking Bernie as a person (even though that is Bernie's call to arms against everyone else) isn't conducive to bringing young progressives into the fold. Biden is going to win the nomination, and we don't need to eviscerate their icon on a personal level to do it.
Bloomberg running attack ads on Bernie wouldn't work, it would just help Bernie. The attack ads on Trump however do work and Bloomberg should devote his resources to attacking Trump. Joe can handle Bernie.
No, we have the strength now to get the nomination, but we will need Sanders' people in the general and should minimize their level of frustration and anger.  And there's so much more material to hit Trump with.  And hitting there demonstrates that that's where our enthusiasm lies.
He doesn't need to. With Bloomberg out of the race, Sanders is done.
He needs to do that and also work for down ballot Dems.
NEW: @JoeBiden 's campaign confirms that he has reviewed @ewarren ’s bankruptcy plan closely, and is endorsing her proposal, as he said in his IL town hall. That's a significant shift, as the proposal would largely undo the 2005 bankruptcy bill the two clashed over in Congress
This is great! Coalition building in action. Gestures like this show progressives that there is a place for them in a Biden administration
Now this is what I call a coalition
This is the kind of Joe Biden I can get behind. The kind who takes the best proposals of his former competitors and brings them into the administration to actually enact them.
I really like this kind of move. Joe is actually building a coalition where voices are heard.
Can't help but wonder if this is a play to win her endorsement.
First sign of genius is ability to change one’s mind. Way to go Liz and Joe!!
Already cast my vote for Biden but today he earned it.
Excellent! Much better to adopt Warren's policy proposals to appeal to further left voters than to adopt Sanders's rhetoric
Ahhhhhh, what a glorious thing it is to review evidence, admit that you were wrong (to yourself, which is the hardest person to admit to) and then doing what's right. This is something that you will never see Bernie or Trump do.  Edit: and you can me damn sure it is not because they are always right.
Planks and endorsement coming?
And guess what?  Elizabeth Warren didn't have to run a campaign to the convention to get this to happen.  If you work with people you can convince them of your ideas.
Joe Biden, the master bridge builder, hard at work today!
Awesome move!
All this 💎 UNITY 💎 is giving me feels, guys
Joe Biden, willing to admit a woman's idea was right.  It's so....... Refreshing.
Nice, nice! Now do universal childcare next! 🤞
Hell yes Joe!  We need to look at Bloomberg’s greenwood initiative   https://www.mikebloomberg.com/news/the-greenwood-initiative-economic-justice-for-black-america
Look at functioning adults working together for the greater good. This is the future that I want.
Cmon Inslee's climate plan next!
🎉
Good stuff. Need to get everyone on board
Good move!
This is amazing,
I wonder when we'll hear Warren endorse Biden.  Perhaps she's waiting until tomorrow afternoon, just before the debate?!  Here's to wishin'!
This is great news
Incredibly smart. I am so proud to be a Biden supporter, even if it was a last minute thing for me 😆♥️
This is so smart. I am so proud to be a Biden supporter ♥️. I was a late supporter, but am so glad for my choice.
It shows he is willing to compromise. That’s a good quality in a leader. Something we currently lack in the White House.
Super important he brings the progressive wing in. This is very smart!
But I've been told you can't grow as a politician. If you felt one way, more than a decade ago, you have to feel the same way today. The negative attack ads don't make much sense if someone can grow as a candidate.  Also, this clears the way for a Warren VP.
Ability to grow as a person and admit mistakes is a key quality we need in the next President. I'm disappointed it won't be Warren, Harris, Klobuchar, Yang, Williamson or Clinton, but I'm relieved that Biden is ready and willing to serve.
Joe Biden evolves.  Bernie Sanders is a stubborn goat that never changes his point views.

Definitely.
Now for UBI
Of course it is, and it's a good one. We know Warren pushed Clinton to the left on financial services issues in order to get her endorsement in 2016, and I'm sure this is what's happening here.   I wish the endorsement could come soon, but I won't be surprised if she waits for Bernie to drop out out of respect for whatever remaining friendship they still have after all this.
Most likely but the plan he is endorsing does have a lot of merit. Win win.
Yes and not just this, it’s an effort to unify both wings of the party.
Perhaps, but it's definitely going to play well for Sunday's debate.  Bernard would have to attack Warren by proxy if he attacks Joe on economic recovery.  Warren is well liked and by attaching himself to her proposals he can play keep away from Bernard trying to single him out as "establishment".
The way you phrased that makes it sound like you think that’s a bad thing, and I don’t understand why.
Have him do the best of all candidates. Medicare 4 all who want it next!
No....this is bad!  We obviously only want the candidate who’s been saying the exact same thing forever even though he’s never accomplished anything substantive in Congress...  /s
Wish I felt the same about my vote. I feel betrayed. I didn't want this and voted for Biden at least in part because he wasn't this.
We're far enough along with primaries that it might be better for her to wait until the general. Endorsements have diminishing marginal returns, so there's no point wasting them in the primary season if it's unnecessary to do so.
Genuine question here (I'm an immigrant from the more libertarian-leaning side of the Yang Gang): Why should the government be involved in subsidizing raising a family? My instinct is to put a firewall between the government and family decisions because I believe that when people are asked to pay for something they (quite reasonably) start to want to have a say in it.
We should never listen to Billionaires when it comes to “economic justice.” Being a billionaire in and of itself means that one is committed to perpetuating injustice.
https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/bankruptcy-reform
This is irrelevant to the OP. I’m also not sure why you think Gillum would be the VP, or why you’d link to a news source that toxic.
And Douglass!
Honestly if he adopts this publicly and pushes that narrative tomorrow during the debate I wouldn’t be completely surprised if she came out and publicly endorsed him on Monday in time for the next round of primaries and to finally end this nonsense with Sanders
Oh not at all. Sorry if it came off that way.  Unifying the party before the general election is a good thing.
That's already his plan. He supports a public option.

Do you genuinely have ideological opposition to people being able to declare bankruptcy on all their debt? Do you genuinely wish you voted for Bernie or Trump?
Raising children, providing them with a safe environment, and molding them into good citizens is a job for all of society. Parents are in charge of the development in their specific kids, obviously, but it is to everyone’s benefit when kids are raised with as much support as possible, including support from the society.  The government is merely the physical manifestation of the interests of wider society.
Why do we only have one fire department instead of competing brands?  Why do we force hospitals to do emergency treatment on people who can’t pay, even though that distorts the market by making expensive emergency care free so people avoid the cheaper preventive care?
People want free shit
We don’t agree on that   I believe honestly working your way up to success is to be admired and attainable for all - that’s what we should strive to do  Create the opportunity for everyone to prosper,  not attack success.   I support capitalism not communism. We have a candidate running for office who thinks breadlines are good and you’re complaining about the proposal that attempts to create generational wealth  Breadlines are not better than generational wealth   We don’t agree
Where do you draw the defining line between "perpetuating injustice" versus doing well for one's self in a flawed system?
> Being a billionaire in and of itself means that one is committed to perpetuating injustice.  I completely fundamentally disagree with that. I'm not  going to pretend I'm an expert on the specific policy because I'm not, but if it's a good plan, it's a good plan, regardless of who's it is.   Also for what it's worth I've heard some in the black community who's voices I respect really complement the plan.
He's a trump troll.
We know Sanders isn't going to drop out before the debate but I winner of he's stay in to= much longer. He is going to get crushed this week.  The more Biden pulls away and the more states he wins the less relevant Sanders looks.
[removed]
Which is a big reason I went to Joe from Pete. Going straight to M4A would be nigh on impossible and the failure would give conservatives ammo to deny healthcare for decades.
Yeah! Their only fault was looking like know-it-alls! Not accomplishing absolutely nothing towards those goals. Lol
I don't regret my vote. I didn't say that. I feel duped. I'll still vote for Biden in the general. It just means I'm less likely to donate to him and I'm now deciding against working on the local campaign chapter. I feel like this is a bait and switch. Particularly to give alms to people that only want their one leader and seldom vote.  Yes i do have an ideological opposition to defaulting on student loan debt. I feel we should be making grand overtures to reduce costs in college and the combination of the debt absolution and the free college plan he put forward does nothing to stop the corruption and waste that occurs at colleges. It also disproportionately appeals to children of parents that were able to prepare their children for college. Which, makes the whole thing ultimately regressive.
Trying to really understand the underlying political philosophy behind this point of view. Where does the public domain end and the private domain begins?  Take molding them into good citizens as an example. If society at large (through their democratically elected representatives) decided that part of being a good citizen is spending at least 3 years playing little league baseball to get first hand familiarity with the national pastime, should they be able to manifest that will through a government little league *mandate*?  Or, do we say that even if it's good for kids, and even if it's good for society, that decision it outside the public realm and is a decision for private families?
Nobody deserves to have more than anyone else. You are supporting a system that allows some individuals to be unequal to other individuals based on something other than the amount of good they have done for the world. That’s shameful.
I haven't seen any evidence that it's possible to attain billions of dollars honestly. Somewhere along the line in order to scale a business to the degree that a business owner has a net worth in the billions he/she will inevitably have made unethical and immoral decisions that take advantage of the hardships of people, animals and natural resources. That is exploitative and not something to be admired.  I acknowledge that it should be possible in theory, but when one is operating at the necessary scale their worldview tends to 'zoom out' and the harm their decisions cause is easier to overlook as simply figures on a balance sheet. If they did take the time and effort to oversee/make every business decision ethically they lose the competitive edge and time management necessary to continue leading the business on a growth trajectory.  This isnt about capitalism vs communism, it's unfettered capitalism vs capitalism with regulatory provisions to reduce the exploitation of the marginalized.
One should do better for society, never oneself. I draw the line of injustice at “working for your own good, rather than the good of your neighbor.”
I mean, I agree with you in general, but the plan itself is only really comparable with our modern market economy. True justice can only be achieved when people everywhere are equal, and that means that we must eliminate this exploitative system called capitalism.
For people like you wondering if he'll stay in much longer, [he just opened five new campaign offices in Pennsylvania](https://billypenn.com/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-is-opening-five-campaign-offices-in-joe-bidens-native-pa/). He's delusional. He's taking this to the convention again.
I think he'll drop out after Tuesday, but if not he'll stay in at least until April 28th, because there are no significant delegate gains between those two points, so let's really hope he drops out after Tuesday.
That's really self-serving. He should use his money to fund down ballot candidates instead of demanding his ego be stroked by the in reality not-so-powerful DNC.
Wow your insight is so important you must be a political strategist ^/s
That's an interesting perspective since my personal political philosophy deems M4A as the goal.
At least your opposition seems somewhat well founded. As a college student who largely wouldn’t be helped by these reforms unless I went bankrupt- I’m far from pleased by this plan but it’s something and shows he cares. IMO lowering costs substantially can only be done by separating sports from college and/or by making it so student loans aren’t special debt (less liquidity but this only helps future borrowers probably). Every college student still sinks costs in by room/board and/or lost wages. Furthermore I am tired of hearing from politicians that my parents are paying for my college as my family’s income is fairly high- because they’re not. I will end up paying 95%+ of every dollar taken out in loans. In any case, thanks for insight into your viewpoint.
Maybe that particular example is a little out there, but we already have a public schooling mandate that society has decided is important to being a good citizen.  Rolled into that is physical education, which is pretty much equivalent to what you said, only in a more generalized sense.  Back to universal childcare, as far as I can tell (I've never been a warren supporter, so I'm less sure about what her plan was) it's not going to replace private child care, just fill in the gaps for low income families.  Seems like it's basically a public option for childcare, that is free for 200% of poverty level and below, and capped at 7% of income for those above poverty level.  Basically I think that when there exists a service that people need to have performed, the free market is going to find a price point that will leave out the poorest segment of the population.  It's inherently vulnerable to market abuse.  In those cases I think it's appropriate for the government to step in and either subsidize, regulate, or provide that service itself.  The degree to which childcare is a 'need' may be debatable, but I think it is.
A mandate to play little league and providing childcare are two completely different things. The philosophy just comes from people helping others by paying for childcare that can be overbearingly expensive for some people through public funds.  I like the UBI idea where people allocate the funds for themselves which was Yang's approach, but providing childcare seems to follow typical social democratic philosophy.
We disagree on this. I believe hard work results in rewards   I do not think you’re entitled to the same things as others just because you happen to exist. You put a qualifier of “the amount of good they have done for the world” - that is very vague, I can argue that living a hard working productive life that results in prosperity that you can share with your family is a good thing.   I respect you as a person. I don’t think you’re entitled to equal assets - you are entitled to equal opportunity.
I'm having trouble understanding you. People looking out for their own interests is immoral? Is any accumulation of wealth unjust in your eyes?
JFC Bennie, five it up. No means no.
I don't think this is necessarily indicative of anything. Pete and Amy were still actively doing what they needed to do if they wanted to go for a long campaign right up until the point they dropped out.
I thought this was a venue to discuss politics. Sorry hun.
Same, but like many Americans I want to see the government succeed in building a well running healthcare infastructure first. If the theoretical design is indeed cheaper and more efficient (which I believe it to be) then let's go out there and prove it. That means putting our full weight into development but let private insurance coexist. Keep private insurance as the bar raiser to differentiate on serviceability which can justify higher prices than the public option.
>Basically I think that when there exists a service that people need to have performed  So this is where I think stuff gets very tricky. First we have to ask how we define what people "need," which you've acknowledged, and I don't think it's reasonable to really ask someone on Reddit to give a complete answer there.  But I think the second question, one which we often overlook, is how did we get to this point in the first place? Go back a generation or two and things looked much different and day care was far less of a need because we had a ton more stay at home moms and child care was considered a luxury. Go back a couple generations before that and having some sort of licensed or trained professional watching over your toddler might happen only if you lived in close vicinity to Downton Abbey and the kids there needed someone to socialize with. So what's changed?  --Stagnant wages so it's harder to raise a family on 1 income  --More women want to pursue careers (or women who want to *can* pursue them)  --Higher rates of single mothers (as the sole income earner, they must work); maybe also fewer multi-generational homes so fewer grandparents taking on child care duties (buddy of mine just had his Russian mom move in to help with the newborn, but I think she's also here for the legal weed)  --Possibly higher expectations in standards of living (so what we "need" is more, and the more of one thing you need the less 'affordable' everything else becomes)  --Probably much higher expectations of income for care givers, and tighter regulations raising overhead  Of course some of these changes are for the better, some less so, some mixed. But, what they add up to from my point of view is that there's probably lots of things to explore beyond "fed gov subsidizes your family planning decisions." And some from a practical political point of view, if you want to shut down conservative arguments real quick, you find any other solution than the government funding it, the "do what you want but don't ask me to pay for it" attitude is strong in this country.
That's less a philosophy and more of just an individual policy. How do we decide what the public ought to pay for? And very importantly, when the public is asked to pay for something, how much say over that do they now get?
True, but neither of them have a history of staying in a race way past when they were viable.
It’s not a place for trump trolls to try and stir division in the Democratic Party but nice try Putin
Having a self consistent philosophy is probably not that important to the typical voter. However, these type of policies do seem to follow the social democratic philosophy?   The specific percentage or amount that the public pays for is kind of arbitrary. Like Yang's 1000 USD/month, why 1000? Just an amount that 'feels' about right. I doubt anyone can come up with a formula to apply to all public aid even the most knowledgable social democrats probably couldn't tell you 'how much'.  I think what UBI attempts to push is individualistic determination of how one spends their allocation of public aid.
Yeah, I'm hoping that Bernie maybe learned something from 2016, I could be totally wrong of course, but we'll find out in less than a week.
Bernie Supporter switching for Biden
Welcome aboard
We cannot beat Trump with out you!
You are more than accepted.  You are wanted and welcomed!  Biden isn't 100% of what you want, but he is 80%, and that beats 0%.  So if you want kids out of cages, health insurance for every single American, and a stop to climate change, you are my sibling in this fight.
Welcome aboard, and of course we can! We're Democrats, that's what we do. This tent is big enough for AOC and Joe Manchin (at either end, but still), so it sure as hell has room for you and me in it. 👊
Same here and voted for Bernie in 2016. But if he can't beat Biden then he sure as hell can't beat Trump. I was supporting Pete but since he endorsed Joe I'm Ridin' With Biden now. 😎
Of course!! We definitely welcome you!
I'm also more ideologically aligned with Bernie, but what matters most is unity, beating Trump, and getting shit done. It's clear that Biden is the one who can get it done. Welcome!
It's fun to see all the different teams assemble.  Bernard Siblings Welcome!
Welcome!
Good to have you
Welcome!  It's time to focus on Trump now
Voted for Bernie, but after tonight, I feel supporting Biden is our best shot to beat Trump, so he has my support.
Welcome and greetings!!!
~~I never thought I’d be fighting side by side with an elf~~ Welcome, let’s kick some ass friend.
A lot of people here voted for another candidate but we're rallying together to win in Nov!
You don't have to ask for acceptance, we don't believe in walls here. Welcome to Team No Malarkey! 💎
Welcome welcome welcome! We all have the same goal. Happy you're here.
Big tent getting BIGGER 🏕
I was undecided between Pete and Biden but now that Pete is out, I am 100% completely behind Biden and excited to see us win the election come November! Our pragmatism will win us the election, and Trump will be defeated.
Welcome!
Welcome, my friend! Ideologically, I'm definitely closer to Bernie (though even closer to Warren), but I'm sure Joe's the guy to lead us to resounding victory in November.  Welcome to the fam!
I'm ideologically closer to Trump but I'm voting for Biden. Sometimes you gotta be pragmatic and I believe he can unite the country.
Welcome. I love the energy of bernie supporters! We need all of you guys that we can possibly get.
Same. Biden is the clear nominee and the quicker we support him the easier it is to win. It's clear after today and super Tuesday that the real world is not anywhere close to Reddit
Hi, new friend!
Hi! I’m a former Pete supporter. I’m so sorry, I know this is tough. Team Joe is inclusive and recognizes that this is a coalition. Joe recognizes this. I think you’ll find that this place is welcoming. 💙💛
Welcome aboard, I know it must be heartbreaking for you right now. I felt similarly when Yang dropped out. We're all in this together now.
Welcome! We accept former supporters of any kind: Bernie, Yang, Warren, Buttigieg, and even Trump. We welcome everyone who wants to join us in getting Biden elected!
> I’m more ideological in line with Bernie   Just about everyone in this community is more ideologically in line with another candidate whether it be Bernie or someone who dropped out. The power of this community is that Joe Biden has always referred to his campaign as a coalition and has recognized that a lot of the other candidates are the future of the party. He has mentioned that he wants to be the bridge for them. He has the access, he hasn't alienated himself to future former Republicans who want an alternative to Trump, and arguably he hasn't alienated himself to Bernie supporters since his focus has always been Trump. I was a Pete supporter and he did take a jab at Pete's experience with an ad that was pulled almost immediately but even then it wasn't an attack on the person. Everyone's welcome, no one should be vilified for their voting or political past, no one should be vilified for their activism because I know a lot of people probably have been told a lot of things about Joe. What I've come to understand is that those people are acting in good faith but were probably fed information in bad faith. It's like our car won't start and we're arguing about the color of the rental. Let's agree that we need to get going first, and once that's out of the way we can start thinking about more of what we want.
Welcome!!!!!
It might be worth reading through Biden's policies, a lot of them are a lot more similar to Bernie's than you'd think and definitely count as progressive. I know what it's like to have the candidate you hope for not succeed -- a huge portion of us on that sub are supporters of Pete, Amy, Beto, Yang, etc originally -- but I think you might find some solace in the fact that while Joe might get there differently than Bernie, a lot of the end results of his plans would be the same.  [https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/)
Welcome! I'm sympathetic to Bernie's ideology as well, and I'd say a lot of others are too. I think you'll find Joe's policies will be great nonetheless albeit not exactly what you'd hoped for. If anything else, he's a transition for this country.
I too feel it is time. I'm from Delaware originally, so this is an easy sell, honestly.  Let's do it for Joe, for Ruth, and even for Bernie and Warren. We're all gonna be Democrats again and take this country the goddamned hell back.
The idea that us progressives won't vote for Joe is malarkey. Warren would be amazing, Bernie is bae, but I'll vote for Joe. If, by some miracle Bernie wins I assume y'all will join us. Cheers Dems. Let's destroy the GOP! We have to clean up their mess again!  Edit: let's make some 🐢 soup too, down with Mitch!
The entire purpose of the primary is for the party to coalesce around one candidate
Welcome!!🇺🇸
So true and let’s get this party started Sanders supporters, Biden supporters. ALL of us !
Same here...I'm heart broken for Bernie, but I've always been ok with the idea that Biden would end up as the nominee.
Thank you!!! I am glad to see people come aboard. I am genuinely excited for Biden going forward. I didn't start off supporting Biden either, but I always liked Biden, and deep down inside I rooted for him, even if he wasn't my first inclination. Let's beat Trump!
If and when Biden wins you the Primaries you need to try to make sure other Bernie supporters vote for Biden in the general election.
It's all good as long as Biden wins the Senate. The legislative branch in the end of everything is the only thing that matters. If democrats win the house and the presidency, but lose the senate, we are looking at 4 years of nothing.   Its really the real reason why I would pick Bernie over Biden, because I am not sure how Biden is perceived by independents, and der spiegel nor any of the German speaking papers have much to say on it.
Welcome to the club! Glad to have you.
Welcome to the team
Fuck yeah, Bernie Brother! Get on the train; it’s leaving the station.
welcome to the big tent!
Bernie supporter here who desperately wanted M4A, or some compromise version of it.   Please sell me on Biden’s healthcare plan.  I have many friends and family who are self employed, make ok money, but have 0$ left over for health insurance after day to day living expenses for them and their family members.
Avengers assemble.
At this point, democratic solidarity and compromise from both the progressives and centrists is what we need to prevent that moronavirus from infecting America for another for years.
Thank you and let’s unite and win the white house, the senate, the house and local races!
You have the most difficult job out of anyone.  To still have faith in politics and still push those around you to be involved after they had their heart broken.  I don't envy the task. And I respect you to hell for standing up to the challenge. If there is anything that would help, you are always welcome to speak up.
Choo-choo! Welcome aboard
Absolutely. Welcome, we try to be decent and respectful at all times.
Hi welcome! Bring your friends!
Welcome aboard. Together we will defeat Trump and restore sanity to Washington
Welcome!
We're so glad to have you with us!
🎪BIG🎪TENT🎪
Welcome!
Welcome to the JOEalition!
People fail to realize that Joe may enact a more progressive agenda than Bernie.  Because Joe can deliver the Senate, and Bernie can't. You can see this based on who is motivated to vote.  Any Dem President with a Dem House and Senate can enact a ton of progressive legislation. If an angry Bernie got into the White House, he wouldn't be able to get anything enacted. Even most Democrats in Congress dislike him, to put it mildly.  Moreover, we "centrists" are mostly not less progressive. You can see this in the exit polling showing people support M4A but support Joe over Bernie. Because "centrists" are in reality pragmatists who are concerned about winning first. 2/3 of the party is very loudly demonstrating they know their swing voter peers and know Bernie would lose in the fall. The fact that the thinking of 2/3 of the party is completely foreign to Bernie voters only says that we're living in bubbles and the internet is broken.  Joe just wants his lifelong dream of being President. He's talked about 1 term. He said the other day he is "only a bridge" to a new generation of young leaders. He's going to let them run policy. And they know if they don't enact a progressive agenda, then they'll have no place in the future of the Dem party.
Biden wasn’t my first choice either, but I’m ready to stand behind him to beat Trump. Welcome aboard 👍🏻

Biden is more conservative than Trump in every aspect. He was against the 1988 Civil Rights Act; he literally supported our WW2 concentration camps, he's more right-wing and hawkish on foreign policy and trade, he has a history of queer bashing, wants to cut Medicaid and Social Security, and regularly attacks both millennials and union workers. He's also more sexist and less mentally stable.  He makes Trump look progressive, and if you think you're going to get all those Sanders supporters to vote for Biden, you're out of your mind.

> But if he can't beat Biden then he sure as hell can't beat Trump  This is why I don't understand those saying Bernie has/had a better chance at beating Trump. He couldn't beat Hillary or Biden, how could he possibly beat Trump?
It's a family reunion!
Blue no matter who
Ditto! Biden gets votes and he gets mine in November.
This needs to be a meme....
Many republican policies help me personally, but I cannot be a part of the circus that is the Republican Party. Maybe one day I’ll consider them again, but I will not be a part of their race baiting and lies.  Free press and transparency are the lynchpins of democracy and I won’t be party (no pun intended) to any group that seeks to tear that pillar down.  You lose that leg and the whole stool falls down.
I don't know why you were downvoted. We do need to unite as a country no matter what.

Let's see evidence of all that. All the evidence that Biden wants to cut off Medicaid and SS, bashes gay people, attacks unions, etc. And please, give us all the evidence that he's also more conservative than Trump.  If not, piss off.  Edit: I see you've got nothing.
Two weeks ago, everyone was sure Biden couldn't beat Bernie. Try not to speak in absolutes when it comes to politics.
On desktop got to about community tab, and under create post should be a community options tab then edit flair
Well his plan will. Also, Congress gets to make the laws, so if they pass universal health care then all Joe has to do is sign it.
> He voted against that multiple times.  When?
It's not as if there is a scale where one candidate is higher up and automatically beats everyone else ranked lower than them. A better comparison is boxing. Plenty of boxers have gone out there and beaten somebody who beat someone else that they lost to.
Because it's not the sum of all Democrat votes that elect the president.   There are Republicans as well that were looking for real change in 2016, and when they didn't see it in Hillary they and Democrats looked at Trump as someone who might shake the system up.   Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced in both his and the RNC's morality and ethics.  Bernie was winning the split ticket,  but everyone rallied behind Biden before super Tuesday to snuff out momentum.   For me,  anything less than M4A is not enough.   The world watches as we demonize his ideas as too far left... when in reality we're the last nation trying to squeeze blood out of stones.   I'll vote for whoever is blue in the general,  but damn I wish I was voting for M4A

Voting for Biden will be voting for the precursor to M4A.   Fight for every inch. Governance is a very long marathon.
As a former Republican, there isn't any way in hell I would have ever voted for Bernie, and a lot of other people on the right feel the same way. A lot of Republicans and former Republicans want to vote for someone who isnt Trump, but we also dont want someone who hates everything we are and believe. Biden is the candidate who promises change, compromise, and most importantly, civility.
There will be another chance 4 years from now.   Given the mess from Trump, we might be better off with a moderate taking the heat for the initial clean up so moderates can’t blame progressives for it. Not a very satisfying silver lining, but worth considering.  In the meantime, pressuring Biden to be more progressive and trying to kick regressives out of the House and Senate could allow for at least some progress.   Losing a battle doesn’t mean losing the war.
Most of Europe has healthcare more in line with what Biden is proposing rather than what Bernie is proposing. Multiplayer structures with regulated costs are common. Single payer is incredibly rare and mostly only the UK. The idea that by choosing a public option we're squeezing water from stone would imply that the best healthcare systems in the world are too.
Democrats and Republicans want completely different kinds of change. Republicans are reactionaries that want to take away the social safety net. Why would Republican voters vote for Bernie?
Bernie was beating Biden in the polls too
I think from 2016 we should all have learned to not count on polls.
Jaw just hit the floor. Joe won every single county in FL. Every. Single. One. 💎💎💎
He also won every county in Missouri, Mississippi, and Michigan!
Over 200,000 votes for people who have dropped out. Is there a reason why names are not removed from the ballot? Especially the ones that dropped out ages ago?
It was a thorough ass kicking.    As a Broward County resident and mail-in Biden voter, I couldn’t be more proud of my county and my state.  :-)
All of this really highlights how overestimated Bernie Sanders's popularity has been since 2016. I think it's pretty clear that Sanders only had that meteoric rise because he was able to juxtapose himself with Hillary Clinton--who was historically unpopular. Now that he is facing a normal democrat in a one on one race, his weakness is abundantly clear. Voters that Clinton lost (e.g. white rural and working class voters) appeared to have returned to the Democratic party.      Hopefully it stays that way in November and those Obama to Trump states go blue.
And all but one in Illinois
Sanders got crushed in Florida. So happy to hear Cuban Americans voted against the Castro and authoritative dictator apologist
Yeah I guess Castro is not cool to Floridians after all.
Bernie is crushed. I'm voting Biden.
Time to stop this malarkey.  #\#DropOutBernie
Those gator emojis were really on the spot! Let’s go Joe!
BeRnIe CaN sTiLl WiN
Anyone know how Hillary performed in 2016?
Sanders should be embarrassed
17,019 votes cast for Biden in Escambia County (part of FL-01), I was one of those 17,019, woohoo!
Amazing!  Support Joe's campaign and rep your support!  Purchase official campaign merch from the official webstore, all made in USA from union labor and proceeds help fund the campaign!  Let's beat Trump!   [https://store.joebiden.com/](https://store.joebiden.com/)
SWEET!!! Like a Florida Orange...
He’s currently won 181 out of the 184 counties from the three states last night. Arizona still has a lot of votes to be counted, so he could very well make it 183 out of 184 when all is said and done.
A great result for Joe! But, I have to sincerely hope at this point that all upcoming primaries are either suspended or delayed. This nomination process is over for intents and purposes and Joe is the winner, having this race continue only puts peoples health at risk
"Revolution. 1%! something something medicare for all!"
Alachua, is the extremely left leaning county where the University of Florida is located. Amazed Biden won there.
I think it was expected. A great win nonetheless. If we can take Florida, it virtually blocks of all path for trump.
Oh surprise, Biden won in Miami Dade by a huge margin. It appears that praising Castro is not a good strategy if you plan to win in Florida.
People on twitter and reddit are loud, but there are way more people who aren't radical and don't go spamming their politics everywhere.
It's Florida, Boomer Valhalla, not sure how this is a surprise.

Don’t forget Alabama and the state that started it all: South Carolina.

Looking good for the general!
Absentee and early voting ballots would have been mailed a week or two a go, and they would have had to be printed before then too.
I think they do not drop out so their delegates are still in play at the convention and most will likely go to Joe (hopefully) .  So people, like Pete and Elizabeth , technically suspend their campaigns instead of drop out of the race, which is why everyone's names still appear.  Confuses most people who just show up and don't follow the election
It would be a huge waste to reprint the ballots every time someone dropped out, which is totally unpredictable at the time the ballots are originally printed.
Once you apply to be on the ballot, you're on the ballot.  There's no "unapply" process.  So even if someone drops out, if they've met the criteria to be on the ballot (depending on state it could be a fee, petition with X number of signatures, etc.), they stay on the ballot.
Early voting.   Also, some die-hards figured they knew Joe would win the state and they wanted to indicate that they wanted their original pick to remain a voice in the party.
Some states have in official process for withdrawing your name from the ballot with a hard deadline.  The campaign has to fill out paperwork and make the request, the state doesn't just decide.
Amen, the same except I early voted on Sunday in Broward
>I couldn’t be more proud of my county and my state.  :-)  First time for everything?
In hindsight many people mistook misogyny as support for Bernie ... hopefully Trump too.  Many/Most of the votes for Bernie (hopefully Trump too) were "anti-Hillary" votes not pro-Bernie votes. If they had been pro-Bernie in the first place then he'd be performing the same or better in 2020 as 2016 but that is clearly not the case.
I agree with you. I think another factor may also be that in 2016, the appetite for political revolution was higher than it is in 2020. Back then, we were coming off of 8 years of Obama, and the possibility of Trump actually winning seemed slim to many people, so the idea of a revolution focused on pulling the Democratic Party to the left seemed appropriate. Today, after four years of Trump and another 4 years looming as a very real scary possibility, people are less willing to take a risk, so Biden has consolidated support as the low risk option.
Also, in 2016 Sanders got a disproportionate amount of media attention, especially in the beginning, because the media wanted an interesting race instead of just covering Clinton, so he got a boost from the free media.  If they gave Martin O'Malley that attention instead, I'm sure he'd have been a more competitive candidate.
Champaign county, you have failed the state.
I have nothing but respect for Bernie. But his self righteous, smug, condescending supporters? Not so much
Yea if he doesn't drop out he clearly believes pushing his platform is far more important than beating trump
At the very least stop giving him coverage as if he's a viable candidate.
[removed]
If I were Bernie, I'd pick a couple planks from my platform (preferably ones referring to the social safety net which we are actually living RIGHT NOW), call up Joe, say, "hey bud, if you can work these couple ideas into your stump speech, I will drop out TODAY and endorse you."  We don't have time for candidates to be campaigning in a crisis. The other primaries still need to happen, especially since there are statewide and local elections that were to have happened at the same time (like a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin). I want to believe that in a horrible, humanity-changing crisis, Bernie will see the forest for the trees and join the team full stop. We'll see, though.
#4 ways Bernie Sanders can still take the primary  -a news site desperate for clicks
She won big too but Sanders won a few counties in the panhandle (ie northern rural Florida)
Don’t forget cuts to social security!
High malarkey levels
He’s about to be fuckin president 🇺🇸
Found a trump vote
Ah yes, way back when, 2.5 weeks ago.  I feel like I've lived several lifetimes since then
Front Page: Bernie wins county in Illinois!
Actually 3, there are 2 donut hole counties that went for Sanders that are very small on the map.
Some of these names dropped out *months* ago.
When I voted in person in CA, Beto and Castro were still there. I was very surprised to find every candidate still on the list.
Actually in Pete and Warren's case, their drop-outs were past the deadline, at least for Florida. Florida has a law that anyone who drops out after.....god, sometime in December, stays on the ballot, even if they didn't "suspend" anything. It's because of how crazy early we send out mail-in ballots here.
I understand the recent drop outs still being on there. But every single name is on there. If they officially drop out (and not just suspend) months before the election, I can't imagine they've printed the ballots yet.
Not really.
You aren't wrong.
Definitely a huge factor as well!
Agreed. Ironic though that so many Sanders people insist that the media was (and remains) out to get them. The reality, like you said, is that the media has given him undue attention.   This is similar to the grievances about the DNC in 2016. Sanders stans complain about how the DNC "tipped the scales" for Clinton. Not only is this not true (even if they were in the tank for Clinton, there's not evidence that their being in the tank for her actually affected the outcome), the fact that the party itself rallied around Clinton created the vacuum that allowed a nobody outsider like Sanders to step in.
Unsurprising though, it's majority college students and professors.
I’m disappointed in my Alma mater.
They banned me on their sub for telling them to support Biden if he's the nominee. They would rather have Trump. They're not Democrats they're disruptors.
Sanders will definitely get none of his platform enacted if Trump wins.
Biden is just Trump-lite. We need an actual progressive.
If Bernie's supporters truly can't distinguish a difference between Biden and Trump, they're a lost cause. The contrast could not be more stark. Control of SCOTUS nominations, progress on addressing climate change and improving healthcare, a functioning justice department, rational foreign and immigration policy, and an end to the most corrupt and amoral administration in US history is well worth voting for.  If Bernie drops out, the Biden campaign can use 100% of its resources against Trump.  The coming weeks will be a huge test of Sanders' character. Will he make a graceful exit and stay on as a prominent progressive voice in Congress, or will he (once again) attempt a desperate, pointless and ugly last stand and try to take Biden down with him?
But he'll probably get independent and moderate-leaning Democrats who may otherwise vote for a 3rd party or a sane Republican.  Look at Biden's platform and then get back to me that he's not offering anything that Bernie voters want. This 'All or Nothing' mentality is a huge turn off. American politics is about compromise.
Looks like Bernie isn't getting his supporters' votes either so it's a wash.
At this point i just want biden to be able to shift his focus to the GE. i have no intention of appealing to bernie or busters. The people who scream establishment are both few, and ideally irrelevant. Most sanders supporters who believe in progress will support biden. The accelerationist shitheels will be left to do whatever they wanna do.
The point is that, if Sanders drops out, Biden can focus his campaign *entirely* on Trump, something he can't do if he's still being attacked from the left. It'd also probably mean Sanders' surrogates would stop slinging mud at Biden for the most part (I say "for the most part" because of David Sirota in 2016).
> Biden isnt offering anything that Bernie voters want  Yes he is
*Holds a gun up to the Democratic Party*  Trump will be re-elected if Bernie doesn't get the nomination. *I'LL FUCKIN' DO IT!*
Biden already voluntarily put Sanders' free college plan on his platform, extended it as an olive branch, and had Sanders immediately take a piss all over it at the debate. I don't think Sanders is interested in the actual plans going through anymore, just dragging Biden through the mud as much as possible.

r/politics be like, “SHOCKING, BERNIE COMES BACK AND WINS CHAMPAIGN COUNTY BY A HUGE MARGIN OF 3%”
He outperformed the polls, and got ~30% of the vote in IL, not ~20%.  I'm surprised and disappointed, though this will have no real effect on the ultimate result.
Malarkey counties tbh
No one actually drops out, they suspend their campaign.
Booker.  Or.  Bust.
If you register to be on the ballot and later suspend your campaign, your name isn't removed from the ballot. That plus mail-in votes early on and voters being uninformed or whatever leads to lots of mail-in votes.
A lot of people suspend their campaign which I'd assume is different than technically ending your campaign. So I guess their name still might be on the ballot in that case?
yeah it's weird that Delaney or Swalwell would still be on there
"recent" is relative. Florida, the cutoff is in December.
Do you remember that you live in Florida?
I really think they did more harm to him than good. They went from idealists to ideologues
You're right, I believe that most of them are actually Independents.
I'm not American but I have lived there for many years. I like Bernie a lot and wanted him to win but I will ultimately always want a Democrat to win. That stubbornness not to vote because their candidate didn't win is shocking to me.
Imagine believing this unironically.  Truth be told, Sanders is WAY more similar to Trump than Biden is.
Honestly, I just sink Trump with Corona virus stuff. Thats honestly all Biden has to do at this point. Parade it across the states and make them remember, and he wins.

Florida Team Pete-er here...so bent that I will be unable to vote for Joe tomorrow. Because Florida votes on March 17th ya'll
Thank you!
Pete guy in Cali, I just got back from voting for Biden at one of our early voting centers! At first I absent-mindedly filled out Pete and had to get another ballot, lol.
Former/current Pete gal here, and I will be voting for Biden. To be honest, since Pete didn’t have a chance in California I was considering voting for Biden to stick it to Bernie, but I was too excited to actually vote for Pete. Now, when I vote for Biden I will have Pete in my heart. As close to win-win as I’ll get haha.
My mod finger got twitchy for a second 😂
Hey we're voting twins! NY votes 4/28 too. Let's givr Joe a nice dual victory!
Wow what's it like to have your vote means so much?  I'm jealous here in New York, nobody cares what I think. Please register all your friends, if Joe can win Pennsylvania, he's almost there. I was a Pete guy too btw! He's awesome and I'm glad he'll be in the administration, can't wait to see what he does.
Hell yea PA for Biden
You devil!  Welcome aboard, neighbor.
I as well can’t vote for him tomorrow but the 10th is only a week away.
Caucused for Pete in Iowa but will happily vote for Joe on Nov. 3, 2020!
Biden is genuine. He doesn’t come across as demanding. I don’t know why the pundit rips him during debate all the time. I think if people sees his emotion, they can see this is really a guy doing this for the country. He is not doing this because of ego or pride or he think he has the best answer for everything, he is doing this for this country. That earns my respect.

My malarkey meter must be broken, because I was getting really high malarkey readings before I opened this post, and yet there was no malarkey to be found.
I too won't be voting for Joe Biden tomorrow.  This is because I'm a New Zealander and can't vote in American elections.
Californian here, there's no fucking way I can vote for Biden tomorrow.  ...cuz I already sent my ballot in and you as much as I'd like to I'm not allowed to vote for Joe twice!
Same, but Michigan.
You had me in the first half
Me either. Have to wait until March 17th!
Whew, my malarkey meter was off the charts
You had me fooled for awhile.   With that said, as a Pete supporter and very avid volunteer for the campaign (I started helping in August 2019), my heart aches for the Pete supporters who are voting today because I know it's really tough.  I don't want people to vote for anyone "Because \_\_\_\_\_\_ said to", but I hope that after last night's announcement, Pete supporters will have had time to go online, do some additional research about who is left, and will come to the conclusion of who to vote for with integrity.
Another PA Pete to Biden voter! Can’t wait!!! PS. How do I get the Pete For Joe Flair?
this was *almost* malarkey.... you're on my watchlist
I can't vote for him today because I already early voted for Pete in Colorado.
Former Pete supporter, and I can't vote for Joe because I dropped off my ballot on Saturday!!  Waaah!!  Every other election, I've turned in my ballot on voting day, but I was just so excited to vote for Pete.  sigh.  I chipped in some bucks and joined the subreddit in penance.  Sorry Joe!  Loved the response to Pete's endorsement speech - it made me cry.
You dog 😂
AYYYYYEEEEE
You had me going in the first half, not gonna lie.
I got nervous right there.... whew.
I also can't vote for Biden today. Indiana's primary isn't until May!   Unfortunately I still can't bring myself to vote Biden. I'll still be 16!
Oh, you scamp. You almost had me thinking there'd be some malarkey here.
Sadly, i sent in my absentee ballot last week.
Me too man. I have to wait. :(
I will not be voting for Joe Biden this primary season...  Because my state already voted and I went with someone else. Good luck today over here though!!
Thank you for voting for Vice President Biden.   I also cannot vote until April 28, I hate that we have to wait that long to go to the ballots. Fingers crossed we’ll have a big lead by then.

How can Pete supporters bring themselves to support Biden when he has been anti-LGBT his whole life until it was politically convenient to not be so. it truly boggles the mind
Weird way to post this 😒
The best state ♥️

April 21 here in CT, and we don’t have no excuse early voting.
Military in Florida here, if I’m not mistaken, early voting started either yesterday, or starts today. At least in Duval.
Pocket that one, to frame when Pete wins his election :)
Pete has a bright future ahead.
I'm going to be sad in about 1 hour when I vote, not for pete as I had wanted to for over one year. But for Joe. However this is what Pete wants me to do, so for the man who actually inspired me, I will. I'll fight for Joe against the coming onslaught from another candidates supporters as well.  I truly know how you feel, as I feel it too. Voting for Joe now, Is a vote for Pete.  Edit: cast that vote, count one for Joe in MA.
A vote for Biden puts Pete in the whitehouse.  He won't sleep there, but he'll be there daily, in all likelihood.
Haha sorry. Figured I'd have sone fun. I actually posted it and thought "watch this get reported by someone who only read the title."
Add a third, I’m excited to vote for Joe when CT votes on the same day.
can't speak for Penn, but it's literally the only worthwhile thing about living in Florida.  dead serious, I have genuinely had friends and family who when asked what they like about living here could only come up with ".....at least my vote's important I guess"
I’m a former Pete guy and I’m joining him to help Joe win the era! Joe has one more vote in PA on April 28!
I cant tell you how many people in know, here in Northeast PA, who voted for Trump in 2016 just because Biden wasn't in the race. Hes going to win PA
Joe Biden is the best thing to ever come out of Scranton!
Be ugly in my county when Biden gets the nomination. Local Dems just threw out "the establishment" and replaced our chair with the biggest Sanders supporter I know.
This is one of my main reasons for supporting him.
Good to know there are other foreigners here that are way too involved in American politics as well
I mean... you can try. They can't say "no" if you don't ask.

You can still help the campaign in other ways little Uce. Glad to see a 16 year old that has enthusiasm already! Good new is you can vote to Re-Elect Joe in 4 years.
Do you actively seek out subreddits of candidates you don't support so you can respond with troll nonsense or did you just happen in here by mistake?
But he also worked with Obama to end Doma.
Because I'm not a single issue voter? I never cared the Pete was gay. I supported Pete for a lot of his stances. Who he loved was never a factor either way.
As for how I can vote for him... I plan to use a paper ballot.
Yes. Yes it is.
Commonwealth
Maybe... and go with me... Maybe he simply was able to look past things. Maybe he can be an adult and say "while he said some shitty things in the past he would still be a good President. People change. And even of they don't change, doesn't mean you have to agree on everything. I said I was jumping from Pete to Joe. That means Joe wasn't my first choice. Even Pete, I didn't agree with 100%.
I’m a gay Pete fan. Biden was in a different time, the whole country was in a different time. However, he was with Obama when DOMA was struck down.   Check out this piece from October with Pete commenting on Joe   https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/joe-biden-gay-marriage-equality
CT is the 28th, isn't it?
Thank you for your service. Joe Biden for President 🇺🇸
I’m going to vote on the 17th. Great excuse to get part of the day off work ;)
Voting for Joe is indeed a vote for Pete—especially because Pete would more than likely be an important part of a Biden administration.
I'm so scared Bloomberg will pull off a lot of Biden votes from the city and hand NY to Sanders. I live in Upstate and I'm gonna do everything I can to give Joe a boost
We rarely matter here. Even in 2016, by the time it got here Hillary had enough of a lead the outcome was inevitable if not secured.
two....
I think Joe gives us the best shot at PA. And maybe even AZ and GA. Sanders gives us the best shot at CA and most of New England. Which we would win anyway.
I concur
Down here in the suburbs of Philly, there’s such hostility towards Bernie from all demographics.
[removed]
I believe Bloomberg completely understands that he has zero chance of winning the nomination. I thinks he's in to fight against Sanders, and Trump. Maybe he says to himself "I'm an irritating prick, but goddamn it I'm richer than shit and I'm going to do best thing I can with all my dough and kick Bernie in the ass."  Or something like that.
think of it this way  you're less likely to get repeatedly told that you're personally responsible for fucking things up for the entire country  there are silver linings to be had
Hey fellow Philly area neolib!  Here in MontCo there is no love for Bernie.  We had a pretty strong Pete group, but I think those folks will naturally go to Joe. Local politics is so big here, and I think there is a general desire for consensus-building, unifying candidates.  Steve McCarter is really popular here and he reminds me very much of Joe.
Okay but Bernie..  Signed a resolution as mayor of Burlington affirming that marriage is between “husband and wife” https://www.washingtonblade.com/2016/02/06/clinton-surrogates-pounce-on-sanders-over-82-marriage-resolution/  Argued same-sex marriage was a states’ rights issue in 2006 https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=57&v=kej9QAsS3uI&feature=emb_logo  In 2006, after same-sex civil unions had been legal in Vermont since 2000, responded to a reporter asking if same-sex marriage should be legalized in Vermont with “Not right now,” after the “very divisive debate” preceding the civil union legislation  From the buzz feed piece I linked above:  In 1992, for example, Biden voted to block an amendment that would have denied benefits to same-sex partners in the District of Columbia.    When Obama chose Biden as his running mate in 2008, the Advocate, a leading LGBTQ publication, emphasized Biden's support from gay leaders in Delaware and his “84% average on nine congressional scorecards issued by the Human Rights Campaign since 1989.”   Biden supporters also note his work to advance a hate crimes prevention bill — named after Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming man beat to death in 1998 — signed by Obama 10 years ago this month.  Biden had hinted several weeks earlier, behind closed doors at a fundraiser hosted by a gay couple, that his thinking had changed. (“Things are changing so rapidly, it’s going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say, ‘I oppose gay marriage,’” Biden said at the event, according to a 2014 account in the New York Times.)
If he really wants to beat Bernie he should drop out and endorse Joe.
In Bucks, there was a love for Pete and Biden. Very little for Bernie. Trump is also pretty popular, id say like 55/45 Dem to Trump. We need to get rid of Fitzpatrick though, that’s for sure.
[removed]
Will a bloomberg endorsement not hurt joes AA base?   I think it would be best to drop out and endorse bernie. Having a billionaire backing you will tarnish his "purity" and completely mess up everything lol itd be funny to watch.
I heard some pundits saying that it's better for Bloomberg to stay in for today because of the way the delegate math works out with the polls.
Seems pretty split between Joe and Bernie in Lancaster. Pete had some support, but usually only as a "I'd be okay with him but I want <insert name here> more."
I would respectfully disagree but you are allowed to do so. I might have more links. I’m a married gay woman because of Obergefell and I was all in for Pete, was one of the first 5,000 donors. I donated on day 1 and he has been the candidate of my heart.
I think if Bloomberg drops out, he won't endorse anyone, just attack Bernie.
Good point.
Oh wow ours was the opposite. Got a lot of “I li&3 pete, but Biden’s the next best thing”
This is all I want.
Biden won all 279 counties in MI, MS, and MO
That’s pretty incredible. Places like Illinois, Georgia, and Florida will be a buzz saw if they’re still contested.
Get the brooms out.
It's no wonder Trump attempted to bribe/extort Ukraine for dirt on Joe when Joe can win counties like this. Trump loved to crow about how many counties he won.
But I thought no one was excited for Joe!! That's what arrr pol is saying lol
While it feels good to see these results, remember:   Trump also just got almost 700,000 votes in Michigan in an *uncontested primary*.  We may have increased our turnout and consolidated around ~~Trump~~Biden, but Republicans are engaged too.  And Trump has wrapped then closely to him.   This is going to be a knock-down, drag-out fight in November.  We can not get complacent.  We need to celebrate our win and then prepare for battle.   Edit: Had Trump on the brain.
*throws confetti *
Oh my god as a Michigander I’m so happy. Washtenaw county went for Biden, which (from personal experience) felt like a Bernie hellhole since it’s the University of Michigan campus.
That is still legitimately absurd. It shows just how strong his collation is and that no matter what the berners say, it's not just inner city dominance but a true collation of Inner cities and Suburbs, PoC and white people, working class and college educated.
McConnell and his followers in the Senate knew, correctly that Biden was the one to fear. They calculated incorrectly and now they too, will pay the price. They forgot who put them there, WE did. Time for that body to go. Traitors.
This is absolutely incredible!
He didn't just win last night, he cleaned up.  Biden has a strong coalition of black voters, older voters across the board, and white, suburban women who often lean Republican.  He has broad appeal with working class voters as well.  This is a winning coalition for November in both the Electoral College and the Senate.
My county in MO was one of the first to call for Biden. ❤️  I live in a majority-minority district, so I didn’t have to vote Biden to guarantee his win here. But I did anyways. Let’s go Joe. 💎
yup.. hopefully ppl still vote next Tuesday though
Any word on Washington? Last time I had a  chance to look it was practically deadlocked with like 80% of the vote in.
MIMOMS
CRUSHING IT
Did he even have a campaign office in those states?
this is it boys & girls.  time to get that joementum with a full head of steam.  gotta win more hearts & minds and be enthusiastic about it.  let's go!!!
What’s some of the policies of Joe Biden we support?  Edit: don’t downvote, reply to me about the policies you’re passionate about
Biden has a massive lead in Florida now, 61 to 36.  That's going to put BS at least 200 delegates behind.   [https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486781-poll-biden-widens-lead-over-sanders-in-florida](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/486781-poll-biden-widens-lead-over-sanders-in-florida)
I will be voting for Joe in Illinois next week.
Atlanta is full of white hipsters with gross hair and rich parents so it might slant towards Bernie but it’s safe to say that we and other counties in GA will go biden.
It's already been mopped.
Someone tried to convince me that Trump is more afraid of Sanders than Biden, that taking out Biden was Trump’s choice because he’s the easiest to take out. Uh huh. Is that why Trump is attacking Biden and expressing sympathy for Bernie?
Biden is rare in that he can have tons of support from both african american and rural white voters.
Regardless of your political stance, it would be pretty ironic for Biden beat Trump in the general election after all of the impeachment smearing that was obviously aimed at Biden.  All throughout the impeachment, the only thing I could think about was how much of the "but hillary's emails" was being ingrained into the GOP voters.   This time around, its "but biden's son and ukraine".   Its already mostly done anyways.
Nobody was, then they unified behind one candidate and a big media push.. now people are. It's as if things can be true/false depending on when in time it was..
> We may have increased our turnout and consolidated around Trump  Uh, think you misspoke there...
> This is going to be a knock-down, drag-out fight in November. We can not get complacent.  yeah for one side, maybe
That's because people are ignoring the fact that 40-45 percent of youth are going to Biden. Bernie has a youth advantage but it's a huge advantage
I am incredibly surprised that Washtenaw went to Biden. I’m happy. But very very surprised.
my "favorite" comment on S4P last night was something to this effect:   - The "establishment" has rigged the primary  - Black and elderly voters are not the "establishment", but:  - They are being told that Biden is the only choice  As if those voters can't think for themselves.
Amen
Makes sense though, McConnel is a politicians, trump is a fake populist, him fearing a real populist also makes sense. You can argue that it's well placed fear or just stupidity, but he is on tape in private conversations saying he feared bernie because he couldn't hammer them with trade deal support.. which let's be real is a very real argument that will come up.. so better to be prepared than to feign ignorance.
and after that. Wisconsin has a Supreme Court election on April 7th, trying to get a Walker appointee out. We were hoping that a contested primary would drive turnout, but hopefully people still come out to vote.
Nate Silver predicted a Biden win this morning. So there's that.
He supports expanding obamacare to provide a publi option  He supports tax incentives to switch to electric vehicles  He supports incentives for solar energy, and potentially a carbon tax  He supports getting our deficit down with some increased taxes on wealthy americans  He wants to solve things with incentives, not big government  There are a few more but those are his major positions. Ask if you are curious about any more of his policies  Idk why people r downvoting you lmao
Sorry for the downvotes. It's just because this question has been asked a HUGE amount on this sub latley, people have been giving quality responses but I think are getting tired of having to repeat.  I would definitely suggest looking around the sub thought to threads that have asked this before and Joe's website.   But I support his climate plan, post-highschool education plan and healthcare plans.  I'm just too lazy to repeat my entire speech again lol.

Well he also just wants to contribute to the division of the party and he knows he can use twitter to harp on how Bernie has been "wronged" where Bernie supporters are likely to see it and get riled up.
Not just Sanders supporters too but Warren stans too. "She'll out debate Trump on that debate stage!" but also take a DNA test at his discretion 😂
[removed]
He's rebuilding the Bill Clinton coalition.
[deleted]
Even now people are saying Biden won't generate as much enthusiasm in the general as Sanders would
if you think the dems are unified, i have a bridge to sell you.
Lol...yup.
At least in Michigan, that's not really close to true: https://twitter.com/pklinkne/status/1237548891286851584?s=20  It looks different in other places with different demographics, and will probably look pretty different in Florida too.
As a young person, I know exactly zero people interested in Biden over Sanders.
I’m not. For all our hemming and hawing online, kids don’t vote
The media shit's on Bernie 24/7.  You can't deny that.  Not to mention the look of all the moderate candidates randomly dropping out before Super Tuesday while Warren stayed in the race.
I’ll be voting in Wisconsin
If he wins Washington, it might as well be over. It’s only getting harder for BS from here.
No worries! I’m just asking now because although I’m a Bernie supporter and haven’t given up he’s looking like the probable candidate so I just want to view him through your lens a bit.
It’s just the first Joe Biden thread I saw today and figured I’d do my looking around here
Because he lives in Illinois.
Nope, he's courting the disenfranchised Sanders supporters just like in 2016.
Warren probably would beat trump in a debate.

Hey what rhymes with "Ken Bone" ??
Depends on how you define enthusiasm, the crowds bernie gather are huge, he's wildly popular.. But being wildly popular in a smaller pond vs the default support Biden has.  There is no biden hype in the same way, just a get on with the work attitude as far as i can tell.
Hmm, fair point.   I like NY times exit polls better. But yeah it only shows 19 percent for Biden under 29 but then jumps to 42 percent with 30-44 group for Biden in Michigan.    https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/10/us/elections/exit-polls-michigan-primary.html  Missouri shows different numbers which each being a little higher for Biden.
Idk. Could depend on where you live.  I'm 26 and I know a couple Biden people. I could the see the post college maybe having a few more then the youths in college.
Fair. That just seems to be the most “liberal” pocket of Michigan. Lots of democrats, including my moms family, but they’re classic democrats. Union workers, blue collar folks.
It is over. Next week is brutal for Bernie, should he decide to press on. His most favorable states are behind us.
Can't imagine why you are getting any downvotes at all.  Most of us are very happy to have conversations about this.  For me, the Obama administration fit my conception of a good administration (and literally the most progressive agenda by a sitting president).  I think Biden could carry the torch here, and I think he'd reach out to more progressive parts of the party in an effort to unite it.     Fox News has so many people scared of any kind of 'socialism' that I think a Bernie presidency would just get obstructed by right-wing politicians who would strive to use fear and anger tactics in order to manipulate Bernie's messages.  However, I think a lot of folks realized Obama wasn't the evil terrorist that right-wingers made him out to be.  I think these folks might be more open to hearing relatively progressive ideas if they came from Biden, because he's already been in an administration that ended with pretty good approval ratings.
Well I'm going to give some more details now lol (since I see you are completely asking in good faith).  For me, I honestly think his climate plan is pretty good. Zero emissions goal by 2050. Rejoining the climate Paris Accord on day 1 in office, trillions towards research into nuclear and other methods, a possible carbon tax. He wants to work with Congress to set specific metric for each year to hit on our March to 2050, people have given him some flack for that but to me that seems normal.   His healthcare of the public option seems good to me too. It will automatically enroll and be premium free for people under a certain income (Im pretty sure), and the public option was pretty much a stepping stone for many countries to getting universal healthcare. Also his healthcare plan has other smaller details that are nice. Like linking drug prices to overseas prices. So if you sell drugs to France for cheap you can't run it up on us. And getting rid of surprise billing by making emergency hospital visits have to bill you as "in network", since when you are in the ER it's not like you can pick which provider you get.   Lastly, I like his education plan. A quick disclaimer I am against free college and mass debt forgiveness for a number of reasons , so that could have an effect here. But I do agree college needs brought under control and is ridiculous prices right now. Joe's plan is free community college ( which cuts everyone tuition in half by paying for the first two years) and calling loan repayment at 5 percent of income, to be forgiven after 20 years of payment. That seems fair to me and makes it so people are not being buried by loan repayments.
I guess. He'll make a lot more progress dividing us. Many Bernie supporters will vote for Biden without question, many don't even vote, the small amount who are selfish enough to spite vote for Trump aren't enough to sway the election. There probably aren't even enough to sway one state.
[deleted]
No question. It would be Bloomberg on steroids.
Warren would turn the debate into a snuff film.
Hillary beat Trump in many debates. Didn’t really matter.
Yeah, it is just one poll and will vary by region, wealth, race, etc. They're not all recalcitrant Bernie bros for sure, but  Biden does have some work to do to win them over by the general
Florida alone will likely be a landslide for Biden. That hammers in the last few nails.  Despite having no chance at the nomination, Bernie will probably stay in the race anyway. It's what he does.
I like that education plan a lot and I’m glad he’s willing to work hard for climate change (#1 issue).  I’m still skeptical that he said he would veto M4A (which I think 70% of people support in polls) and wish there was more talk about cutting defense spending I really want a president who’s against war. I also want more talk about taking care of our K-12 education.  He has my support if he’s the nominee 100%. Thank you for being kind in your responses and realizing we are stronger together even if we don’t agree on every policy!
Not according to 2016.
He's not a brilliant debater, he doesn't debate. He throws shit. If there is any weakness he will repeat it until people think it's true. It's not as if Clinton lost the debates..
Ignore the title and watch this: https://youtu.be/LibRNYJmZ-I  I despise Trump but he is not to be underestimated and particularly given the ample material he can hit Biden with.  Also did those same polls not predict a Clinton victory?
Didn't say it did.
Thanks for correcting me.  I think the stat I was repeating I heard during the ST results so it might of been one of the ST. But I need to look closer next time.
What states were swayed by disaffected Bernie voters in 2016? Would love to hear more about this, I heard it in theory as a possibility but never saw anything that indicated it actually happened.
I didn't say to underestimate Trump. I said he was bad at debating, which he is.  And the 2016 polls were pretty accurate. National polling predicted Clinton would be ahead in the popular vote by several points, and she was. There were some issues with state-level polling, but nothing too out of the ordinary. What was out of sync with reality in 2016 was the punditry, not the polls.
https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds
Fair enough. I guess I would just see a nuance between Trump being bad at debating and being bad at debates. His ability to reframe, manoeuvre and bludgeon is 'impressive'. After seeing what Trump did to Bush on the Middle East, it's not going to be pretty seeing him hitting him on Iraq, China and [his son](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/its-totally-normal-that-joe-bidens-son-works-for-a-ukrainian-energy-company/372385/).
Interesting. But is says 12% of primary Bernie voters voted for Trump and also that 12% of Republican primary voters voted for Clinton. So there's definitely more at play here. Very interesting that so many Sanders-Trump voters believe white people have no advantages. It would make sense for Bernie supporters to be a mix of people who want better for their country, and people who think the system is stacked against them. Trump definitely ~~lies~~ speaks to the latter.
> His ability to reframe, manoeuvre and bludgeon is 'impressive'.  Well, I don't agree. And neither did the majority of the people who watched him debate Hillary Clinton in 2016. His polling took a pretty substantial hit after each of those debates. Sure, his fans like it. But they like him no matter what he does.
I'm a hard Bernie supporter, but damn if the community surrounding him doesn't suck. I'm very happy to see how civil and kind this community is. Well done and happy Super Tuesday.
Thanks! And regardless of who you support you’re always welcome on this sub! 🙂
Any time I hear of some civil folks amongst Sanders peeps who actually vocally disapprove of the venom I am really pleased.
In the end we just want to beat trump!!!
Thanks, man, this is really decent of you.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸♥️♥️♥️♥️💎💎💎💎
I’m with you, OP.  I’m a Sanders volunteer from ‘16, Warren supporter this time around, and I’ve posted more in this sub here than in any Bernie sub because I couldn’t stand people saying Biden or Buttigieg we’re literally worse than Trump.  With Warren done after yesterday, I’ll be volunteering for Sanders again, but not because Joe’s some awful entity that needs to be stopped at all costs.  Joe would bring dignity, respect, and compassion back to the office and our country!
Bernie supporters simply do not get that people largely vote on emotion. They shit all over people, and then when people say "Ok I'm not voting for your candidate," they make a surprised Pikachu face and write "Oh my god you're going to base who you vote for on whose supporters were mean to you on the internet? You sound like a real genius."   Yes, yes I am, asshole. And I'm going to be thinking of you when I pull the lever for Joe.
SandersForPresident is the dem version of The_Donald.  That sub literally turned me against Sanders.
Hands across America time people... We vote Blue in November. Pass it on.
VOTE BLUE, NO MATTER WHO! Even if it is Sanders.
The sanders communities are very civil, the only people trying to make us fight eachother are the russian bots.
You'll be welcome here in the general.
Thank you!
All I can think about is how the hell is that dog not freaking out next to that thing
The Sander's community is also filled with foreign trolls instigating the hatred and divisiveness.  Fool me once shame on them , fool me twice shame on us.
That is why you should join our cause .   We are about uniting the country , where as Bernie is about uniting part of the country.  Also I do believe there are people from foreign countries maybe even working in boiler rooms posing as everyday American reddit users working to instigate divisiveness in our party.  Fool me once , shame on them, fool me twice, shame on us!
I feel like  “Aren’t you exhausted by all this”  Could be Joes campaign slogan moving forward   The hostility has to end
Marshall is such a good boy
How do we convince Bernie or busters to get on board?    Genuine question-I’m having trouble and I have a few friends who are
In 2016 I had a brief Bernie or Bust phase after the convention and got over it in a month, now I had a brief Bernie or Bust phase because the Nevada debate convention question rubbed me the wrong way. I deleted a lot of my recent posts on Reddit because both times I let rationality take me back.  I will be voting Bernie in my state’s April primary because I agree with his platform more, *I want affordable healthcare*, but I will crawl over broken glass kicking and screaming to vote for Joe Biden in November because after last night it’s clear he is going to be the nominee. I hope he gets a majority because I don’t want to see a contested convention.  I know a lot of you guys here like Pete and that’s great, I’m going to be honest and say him declaring victory in Iowa when nobody knew what was going on still rubs me the wrong way. As for Warren, I don’t know what to think of her anymore, I feel like she let me down. I don’t have an opinion on Klomentum.  Fuck Bloomberg, and now he’s out. Good.  But I’ll be damned if I don’t do something to prevent that fucking clown from getting re-elected even if I don’t fully agree with who we’ve nominated. Also I agree, the ‘bend the knee’ bullshit really pisses me off.  Besides, I need a place to talk about the election! I’ve been banned from r/Politics since 2017! Making a lame joke about passing a motion to punch Mitch McConnell in the face is apparently ‘advocating for political violence’.
Biden supporters can actually comprehend that others have different perspectives and may support different candidates.   That's why his base is the broadest and most diverse.  The thing I'm reading over and over again on reddit is Sanders supporters just bewildered  that everyone doesn't think like them.   But I think Biden supporters understand the appeal of Sanders.  They just feel results are more likely achieved a different way.   All are welcome on the Biden train, even if he's not their top choice.
I am a Sanders supporter and I’m a nice person. I just wish my son could have health insurance 🤞. I plan to vote blue no matter who tho.
I’m a Bernie supporter but I’ll vote blue no matter who come November. Beating Trump is the most important goal.
Yes we need all the dogs pulling together in the pack in the end even the wilder scarier ones.  Welcome and include everyone.. MUST. BEAT. TRUMP.
Bernie supporter as well. I came checking the Biden sub to see what this community is like. Sander’s die-hard supporters are just like any die-hard political supporter but man can they be blind.   I do have to say though - that Sander’s energy is admirable. I love it. I love the passion and the resolve. That’s all Bernie. I mean this with all due respect, I can’t say Biden inspires the same energy and enthusiasm.
Last night they were to busy plotting the demise of Warren to vote for Bernie.  Priorities.
Thank you! And I just want to give credit where credit is due to Bernie and his campaign for their excellent Latino outreach! With Bernie's support, TX and AZ will go blue this November!
We all need to be reminded that the loudest voices behind a candidate are not representative of everyone behind a candidate. Thanks for being here.
Thanks for the kind words! If the time ever comes for it, you are more than welcome here.
I'm a Pete and now Biden supporter. Thanks for posting here. Yes, the toxicity is one of the main reasons I couldn't support Bernie. Welcome and hope you stay regardless if you support Bernie.
r/SandersForPresident is ok, r/wayofthebern is quite toxic tho
As the recipient of enough rat emojis to fill a zoo, can't disagree with you on this point.
Hang in there. Keeping joy at the top of priorities is a great shield to negativity. Not a Sanders fan (Pete guy), but good luck to a good supporter.
Bernie Sanders supporter here, while I've seen a lot of petty nonsense and hate from Bernie's supporters I've seen a lot of love and encouragement.     Browsing here, I can say the same is true for Biden's. I wouldn't/won't bash someone because they support a different candidate but I'll say here what I've said on Bernie's sub:    Trump is the one winning right now because we're at each other's throats and he is exploiting the shit out of it.
F
I like Bernie's character. I like his vision.  But OMG his supporters seem to believe the man can split an ocean if we believe in him hard enough.   Just to keep his base he's got to over promise. This isn't something Joe has to stress over. No malarkey, only politically viable policy.
Sanders is a nice enough guy, but some his base is cuckoo.
Probs cuz there’s like 11 people in this sub lol

Hard Sanders supporter as well. I like lurking in the other subs (like I’m doing now) just to expose myself to other views and goddammit—the amount of Sanders supporters brigading the warren sub makes me face palm :(
It’s a majority, honestly. It’s a loud minority that just sucks ass. I hate the fact that I’m often dismissed for being part of a radical movement just because a few dickheads decided to be assholes to others. They just don’t get that it’s not convincing people
I was an OG bernie supporter, and I mean like 2014 OG bernie supporter. /r/sandersforpresident had like 3 posts a month. I'm so sad in what the community has become. While I was HUGE for bernie in 2016 I didn't actually really want him to run again. Warren looked like she was going to do it this time.
[removed]
I couldn't agree more.
[removed]
I thought this post from Buttigieg's comm chief Lis Smith yesterday was interesting, apparently she was also a Sanders voter in 2016:  > I never thought I’d be a Sanders (2016) - Biden (2020) voter, but here we are.  https://www.twitter.com/lis_smith/status/1235024798909992960
I had the same thought! They constantly act like assholes then get surprised when they're called out. My favorite part is when they say "The whole system is rigged" then don't go and vote. Of course the candidate you want is going to lose. So many of Bernie's key demographic didn't vote because it seems they'd rather be armchair voters on Reddit rather than real active voters.  The way I see it, Bernie and Joe want the same things, or at least similar things, but Joe's plans make things slower to get them. Which to me isn't so bad. Change takes time, and we've seen what drastic change can have on other countries around the world throughout history. And if they really want a change, vote for a Senate and House that would support Bernie or Joe. We should be working together.
But couldn’t it also be said that Sanders’ support is based on emotion in the first place?   I had someone tell me that “my contempt for the poor is disgusting” for supporting Buttigieg. All of the major candidates have great ideas that would help poor people in this country, but Sanders is the only one who does according to them. It’s like they didn’t even take a few minutes to read the policy positions of the other candidates and listened to what r/politics told them.
I don't agree. I think a lot Bernie's appeal among his supporters is emotional. You can see it at his rallies. He inspired me more than any other candidate in this field. He is more authentic and cares more for the working class than anyone else IMO.   But I'll set aside those feelings and vote for Biden in the fall. For the Supreme Court if nothing else. Like pretty much always.
If a candidate's supporters are the reason you don't support them, you spend way too much time on the internet. I've got that sub blocked but still voted for Sanders.
It really isn’t. They are passionate but not malignant.
That’s not what I’ve seen. I’m a Brit who’s interested in American politics, I’ve seen a lot of Sanders supporters being toxic all over Reddit. When I see any Biden supporters comment support for Biden they generally just get down voted into oblivion.
I wish that was true, but it's not, and insisting it's only infiltrators giving Sanders a bad reputation is really dismissive of all of our experiences.
This sort of thinking is why many can't join the Bernie camp. There are only a few things that are absolutes in life so arguing that it's all Russian bots is impossible.
That’s Marshall, Joe Rogan’s dog. The werewolf statue is in his podcast studio so the dog probably sees it every day and is used to it.
I've seen quite a few be like "I WILL NUKE AMERICA WITH FOUR MORE YEARS OF TRUMP IF IT MEANS BRINGING THE SOCIAL CLIMATE FOR BERNIE!" which one, always feels over dramatic, and two, is such a resoundingly asinine idea it's a wonder so many Bernie bros are surprised when things don't go there way.
Russians man...Russians.
I think I will still vote for Bernie in the primary, but Biden has definitely earned my respect. I would have voted blue anyway, but I do think the country would be in good hands with Biden.
The best boy!
Here's how I put it with each year being a number. Let's say that moderate candidates are 0, progressives are +4, and regressives are -4. Here's what we see.  Obama: 0  Trump: -4  Bernie: +4  Biden: 0  Based on this, we are at -4, and a vote for Bernie is +4. While Biden would be 0 and have us remain at -4, busting would cause Trump to win which brings us to a -8. This means that the next candidate after Trump would require +8 to get us back on track rather than the +4 a candidate after Biden would require.  In summation, voting for Biden would stay at -4, but it would also keep us from going down into a -8, and make it easier for us to unite and progress.  Of course this number model isn't perfect, but I'm speaking about this from the perspective of a Bernie supporter, which your friends (and me) are.
IMO the reason Pete was able to confidently declare victory in Iowa was due to the strength of the organization of his campaign and internal numbers that were very reliable. I definitely can see how it looks like cockiness etc. but he backed up what he said because he had hard data in Iowa due to his large presence and effort there.  This is the same reason why he dropped out when he did. He saw his path close and left the race. His internal numbers and data demonstrated his best option was to drop out.
FYI your comment was hidden tho it doesnt seem negative upvotes.
Welcome! I know. I'm Team Pete and Biden doesn't inspire me the same but I will support him so we can unite the country and defeat Trump.
Seemed like some were plotting the demise of the DNC for Bernie
He wasn't robbed. I voted for him in the primary in 2016 but it's the same damn problem, he alienates the party and then the party moves against them as is their right.
> the sanders fanboys being absolutely toxic  zero seconds later  > shillary and the DNC robbed Bernie
Hillary won fairly.  Kindly don't insult her.
I assume your username has already gotten you banned from /r/SandersForPresident
I get you man, but it's easy to get expectations too high and be naive. I'm sure Sanders has people's interest in heart, but I'm sceptical if he could actually pull off most of his ideas even if he beats Trump. You see, American politicians and, to be fair, most of citizens aren't too keen on anything labeled as socialism so, at best, Bernie's policies when put to reality would probably be heavily watered down.  Also I could be wery wrong, but that's just my opinion, an outsider's one too.
I understand why you like his policies. I don't think anyone here doesn't care about supporting the broader picture too. Where Bernie loses me, is his ability to unite people; not just his own followers, but everyone. The country is already completely divided from trump's administration. If Bernie is stuggling to unite all of the left then how is he going to get republicans on his side once he's in office? Medicare for all sounds great but if the country remains divided its not going to pass congress.
Why are you here, trying to stir things up? I stand for things, but I also pay for them. Please stop alienating voters.

I also think it's an offline/online thing. I know a lot of fantastic Sanders supporters IRL. However, when people are online (and it's not just Sanders...you even see it with sports teams or those kids who stan pop stars)....people tend to be way harsher than they would in real life. It is some sort of weird hive mind thing where being brutal becomes encouraged...Also, the very nature of twitter encourages elevating the loudest voices in the room even if they aren't the majority.
Well the Castro lover who was felled by a cheeseburger isn’t going to beat trump.
Buh bye, Bernie bro.
She needs a top-shelf position in the campaign *yesterday* (assuming she wants one). Ditto with anyone else from the excellent Warren and Pete comm/social media teams. They were best in class imo.
[deleted]
What if that candidate is constantly talking about a "movement" and "not me, us"?  If a sizable chunk of the "us" is vicious, and spreading misinformation and disinformation online, isn't that a problem that the leadership of and all the good people in that movement should be able to steer in the right direction?
The supporters arent the reason Im against Sanders, his policies and how they are going to shaft me are.
A candidate’s movement is reflective of their leadership. Bernie was already not my first choice, but the way his supporters treat other people cemented my belief that he is a bad candidate and bad for America.  And in my case, I didn’t get the abuse only from strangers on the internet, I got it from my own friends. People I’ve known half my life, who were members of my bridal party, who I’ve shared meals, laughs, and memories with. Calling me a shill, a coward, condescending, idiotic, secret conservative...   There are better ways to accomplish a progressive agenda.
To be fair, some of his campaign staff are just as bad.
So white supremacists rallying around Trump isn't any kind of signal about Trump, but rather me spending too much time on the Internet?
I think people should discount random posters on the internet-especially knowing that Russia is running  psy-ops, but the problem from my perspective has been that a lot of his campaign surrogates have come off as nasty and frequently dishonest, and his speech last night is not helping the idea that the problem starts at the top.
I've got a couple death threats that say otherwise  Never had that from a MAGA
Really?  In Pete’s subreddit, among other things, I’ve been called a “cock loving homo lover“ was told that I “should choke on Pete’s dick and hope we both die doing it”   This was by a user who posts daily in s4p. And I’m not even gay. Was just passionately supporting a political candidate who happens to be
Do you have any of those examples saved? I've seen rude people on politics but thats mostly bots and astroturf.
There are a surprising amounts of bots on twitter, too.  The Root did a pretty good piece on Russians pretending to be Black activists on twitter/fb.  I'm always surprised when people downplay Russian interference, because there's been enough proof over the years....I don't know how big of a role it was (could have been tiny in the long run) but it definitely happened.
OMG, is that a Michael J Pollard reference?
This is OK for you but attaching some kind of universal scoring system doesn't reflect the diversity of views from the electorate. E.g to a lot of folks Biden is a +4 and Sanders is perhaps even negative as they don't want their taxes raised, they don't want a socialist, they don't like purity tests and division.   The 'status quo Joe' is unfair, and I doubt your sincerity. Then again this is a pro-biden subreddit so of course I'll defend his candidacy and policies, many of which I feel are superior to those outlined by Sanders.
It was also a win regardless of actual delegates to his campaign because it would have theoretically shown he was a legitimate option and that was always his issue.
So you’re denying the collusion between the head of the dnc and Hillary?
Suppppper banned.   I think Reddit might be profiting from all the donations they raise for Bernie. How would I prove it though??? I KNOW
I’ll just add to this ... it’s worth it for voters to take some time to learn what a candidates ideas and policies are. start with Biden’s website and go from there.
He’s offering a valid discussion
I was going to say the same thing. I know a ton of Bernie supporters in real life, and they're all lovely.

At 3:48 you can see Pete swallow back some oncoming tears right after his eyes get a little glossy and his blink rate had increased.   I only noticed on the third time I was watching, because my eyes were too blurry from my own crying during the first two views.   It's been a good year following and supporting Pete, and I'm so proud of what he has done for the entire party by being a candidate.   Pete brings people together. Pete brought me here. Joe has one more vote coming his way tomorrow once the postman stops by the house.   #TeamPeteForever  #TeamBiden2020
Pete supporter here. I was planning on sitting out the rest of the primary, but this changes things for me. Biden isn't the most eloquent speaker, but he makes up for it with his honesty and decency. Let's unite the party around our shared values and win this thing! Biden 2020!
Pete guy here. I've never shed tears over anything a political candidate has ever said. I did for this. And I think part of it was I could feel how genuine both of them were being. Rarely do you ever feel something so real from politicians. I used to think that having to choose Joe would end up being a better of two evils situation. Now I'm legitimately inspired and invigorated. This was a side of Joe I've never seen, usually only having seen him on the debate stage. Proud to be supporting him now. Although it doesnt really feel like supporting him specifically as much as supporting a movement inspired by Pete but with Biden being the best leader to bring people to the cause (hey I'm a Pete guy, I'm a little biased). So crazy how much changed in the period of 48 hours.
Oof this was emotional.  I went from supporting Beto to Pete, and briefly to Warren, but tonight I think I might have to vote for Biden. It’s been a long campaign for me. Quite a coalition of people he has here, I hope he can find a spot for Warren in his administration even if she doesn’t endorse him.
This was so moving and I’m still shocked he said this, not because I don’t think it’s warranted but because I still can’t imagine him saying anything like this in the first place.
I'm not crying, you're crying...     Former Pete guy from day one.  Former republican.  Prouder to support Joe after watching this video.  Country over party, country over self.
I took it to be Joe's highest compliment and not something he would say if he didn't mean it.
 I like it....Joe is taking on the MATH approach to political fashion 🧢🤙 🙅🏽‍♂️👔  Yang gang here, not sure who I will vote for but I like Joe.
I thought this was only going to be an event where Pete endorsed Joe, but was shocked when it turned into an emotional event where they endorsed each other in very personal ways. I feel like we just witnessed the start of something bigger than just the election.
I just saw that this sub has adopted Pete's Rules of the Road. As a Pete supporter who is now #TeamJoe, you honestly don't know how much that means to us. That was very thoughtful!
This is pulling too many of my heart strings.
Why are you people always cutting onions over here?    ..... T\_T
Former diehard Pete here. Happy to be here. I have so much hope with this party. I really hope Pete is veep.
If possible, I would like to see Pete as Secretary of State.
Former Pete supporter, I wasn’t thrilled at first but after watching this my heart literally melt and I saw the hope again for this country. Biden2020!
I had tears.  To see Joe compare him to Beau... wow.  I wish he was better at debating, but this is the Joe we need.  Our country is going to need to heal after Trump is gone, and Joe showed me a kind man who can do that.  My heart was broken when Pete left, but that was such an incredible moment.  He understands why we love Pete.  I’m behind Joe.
Former (Current?) Pete supporter here. Just curious - what do you all think of Pete before this? Did his endorsement change your view?
Okay, now I’m crying. 😭
Absolutely beautiful
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING!! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
The fact that Pete lost his father this year just adds layers to that onion they're cutting over here.
Thank you!
Pete can be to Biden what AOC is to Sanders.  Pete’s endorsement last night changed my mind.  He caused me to see Joe in a different light, and that perspective has me fired up all over again. I hope Pete visibly campaigns for Joe as a surrogate. Pete can close any enthusiasm gap perceived or real, and together they will heal this nation.
Welcome!
Same same same! I am fired up now!
I think that Biden's empathy is so deep, and it's exactly what our country needs right now-- I'd really recommend watching his town hall video where he talked to one of the family members of the victims of Emmanuel AME in Charleston.   You can see the question starts here (I started at the time where the answer starts): https://youtu.be/81bzoO9Qy9A?t=356  So happy to have you aboard.
Yeah I voted for Biden yesterday morning and felt fine about it (democrats abroad ballot) but when I saw this I just imploded. I have a very different level of enthusiasm than I did 24 hours ago.
Wow, I had the same trajectory as you, except the Warren part.
I think Warren is a top pick for Secretary of the Treasury for sure.
Alright Biden got my vote.  I went from Bernie to Yang to Pete to back to Bernie once Pete dropped but this was very moving. Biden is a very good man (made that clear in how he talked about Yang and never personally attacked Bernie) and if he has Pete’s support, he has mine as well.  Hoping that Yang gets a prominent role or ideally gets picked as VP on Biden’s ticket. Yang appeals to the same young left that Bernie appeals to, but he does so without being divisive and he brings in support from Trump voters as well.
the second biggest compliment was when he said that if Pete had been on the national political stage for another 6 years this endorsement would be happening in reverse.
This is legitimate praise. There is NO WAY he would ever say that if he didn't mean it. Iirc, he prefaced it by saying he shouldn't, but it was something he had to get off his chest. Even if I was neutral to both of them going in, I'd still be here now. I think Harry, Pete and Amy endorsing will and has given him a better outlook on life and the future of the party. One he is willing to Fight for.
I've been ridin' with Biden the whole time and..... he definitely wouldn't.
I couldnt agree more.   Biden would do amazingly well in Califronia, Washington, New York and Chicago if he just addresses his biggest weakness as far as young educated left voters are concerned.  I am part of the young left bernie bros.  Every other person who volunteered on Bernie 2016’s campaign with me went from Bernie to Yang and now are going back to Bernie.  This article is spot on... https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/bernie-sanders-andrew-yang-gang-2020-057985   Everyone can see that Biden is a nice authentic person that would fight for the middle class (the same reasons why Bernie and Yang exceeded expectations in 2016 and 2020 respectively). And Biden has a big pro on Bernie, he doesnt engage in class warfare and portray educated well off people into the enemy.   But I really wish Biden would speak up about automation (an issue young people care deeply about and many older voters seem clueless about). I have my mail in ballot ready to fill out and I want to fill in the Joe Biden bubble on it, but am apprehensive that he doesnt take automation seriously.  Yang really wanted to endorse Biden but some of his biggest donors and earliest supporters (especially all the ai researchers living in silicon valley including my wife and her coworkers) feel that Biden is out of touch when it comes to tech and will feel betrayed if Yang endorses a candidate that doesnt speak out about the imminent threat that automation poses...  https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html  90% of the population is completely oblivious to what is about to occur in the next two decades. Many Yang voters would vote for anyone, even Trump, if that candidate actually seems to understand the decision the US government will need to make in the next decade about how to ensure the benefits of automation get distributed to everyone...  https://marshallbrain.com/manna.htm
Man a Yang endorsement would be huge. Love the guy.   -Pete fam
If Joe and Obama had the buddy-cop movie thing going on,  Joe and Pete have a father/son chemistry that is off the charts and I think America would eat them up as a ticket together.     the advisers might say no, but my heart says yes
Part of the reason we need Biden to win is so Pete gets a job that will transform him into a a juggernaut of a presidential candidate. He became a star during this primary, now we need to make him a president. Whether it’s VP or a cabinet position, Biden said Pete will have a role in his administration. This needs to happen.
I wonder if Pete or Amy is gonna be his VP?
I hope he can flip a senate seat in Indiana, but I’ve also been thinking about State for him. He’s fluent in six or seven languages (and taught himself Norwegian so he could read their books) and served in the military. I’m sure he’s got quite the international understanding.
Did Biden not support gay marriage as recently as 2009?  Aw cute you guys can downvote but you cant actually come up with a response. Good luck tonight! You will need it
Did you know Pete isn't the first person he's compared to Beau? I hope this isn't something Joe does often to pull on people's heartstrings. That would cheapen the moment.
Loved Pete..if he had been a Senator or Governor, maybe even a congressman, I may have voted for him over Biden.  I look forward to voting him for POTUS one day
I was planning on voting for him in 2032.
And his dad's name was Joseph. 😢
Plus, Joe's entire campaign is a little *out of date* for lack of better wording.  Pete has run the most compelling campaign since Obama, and if he can bring some of his people along to help Joe, this whole thing could get a lot more exciting.
Or secretary of education. She can help fix the student loan crisis.
We'd have to deal with losing her Senate vote for 6 months, republican governor gets to choose her replacement.
> I went from Bernie to Yang to Pete to back to Bernie once Pete dropped  damn, that's a ride lol
Don't worry man, there's a chance Yang will endorse Biden over Bernie. (Non-american YangGanger here)   Watch this video by an ex-Trump supporter turned YangGang, compilating evidence that Yang & Biden have more in common than Yang & Bernie.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-SkQDPxUbT8
Did you know that Pete actually understood Artificial Intelligence? He actually has a chapter dedicated to it in his book. They implemented smart sewers in South Bend. Really only Yang and Pete understands the new technology. Which is why I think Biden having both (probably) in his administration will be best for the country.
I'm just a newly-arrived refugee from Pete Land (who also loves Yang), but I'm glad to read this and hope you'll keep speaking up here and sharing your concerns and suggestions.
Yeah, it's been visible for a long time.  A father who lost a beloved son, a son who lost a beloved father.  Hallmark production stuff, except it's genuine.    I don't think VP is the best role for Pete, but no one's called to ask for my opinion on that yet.
I'm very hopeful after this video.  https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Rd-fxBdYd/

Nail on the head. He would make an amazing international diplomat.
I don't know if Pete would actually be interested in the Senate even if it were a possibility in Indiana. I honestly think he views the role as fundamentally disconnected at this point in time from the lives of everyday Americans, due to gerrymandering, voter supression, and the general distrust of the institution.
I think UN Ambassador might be better for him than SOS
He also sits on the board of a foreign policy think tank. On top of that, his job in the Navy was an intelligence officer. He was tasked with disrupting the financial support of terrorists, so I think he has a deep understanding of that whole issue.
My comment had nothing to do with gay support. I like Pete better because he was younger. I’m happy to see Biden did so well on Super Tuesday and will be voting for him here in Florida.
it just doesn’t really have to do with anything
Does it really matter?
#😭
Ugh night and day from what we have now
Ah shit.  Didn't think about that.
I am part of the young left bernie bros. Most of my friends went on this same journey with me sans Pete.  Every other person who volunteered on Bernie 2016’s campaign with me went from Bernie to Yang to back to Bernie.  This article is spot on... https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/28/bernie-sanders-andrew-yang-gang-2020-057985
Yang wants to endorse Biden but some of his supporters (especially all the ai researchers living in silicon valley) will feel betrayed if Yang endorses a candidate that doesnt speak out about the imminent threat that automation poses...  https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html  90% of the population is completely oblivious to what is about to occur in the next two decades.

Yes. Which is partially why I went from Yang to Pete when Yang dropped.
Smart sewers weren't AI, just sensors and programming AFAIK.
Oh my gosh, I’m crying. I hope so much that he makes Pete VP! I’m currently really really torn between Biden and Bernie but that would 100% send me over the edge to Biden
Omg I can’t stand kamala. She has a horrible attitude. Pete would be a great choice but I think he would do better being in senate first then do a president run later on.
You tell me. Do you care if this was a spontaneous and sincere thing rather than something calculated and manipulative?   If you felt moved by the moment I think it's best not to dwell on such things and just enjoy it.
I also don't  know why she would want to be Secretary of the Treasury instead of  a Senator.
You poor guys must have vertigo.  Wherever you land, land safely.
I don't know what makes you think Biden won't speak out about the threat automation poses. In fact, he's written on the topic before:  https://www.bidenschool.udel.edu/bideninstitute/research-policy/biden-institute-blog/Let%E2%80%99s-Choose-a-Future-That-Puts-Work-First  https://bidenforum.org/a-plan-to-put-work-and-workers-first-fab53c7ba517  Just because he hasn't come out in favor of a UBI doesn't mean he doesn't understand the threat.
I have news for you my friend. "sensors and programming" is essentially AI.
I understand! I see they say (lis) says they have a big week coming up.
[deleted]
So if you think he shouldn’t dwell and just enjoy it why are you trying to upset him over it?
well i imagine Warren wished she had Geithner's power when she and him were butting heads in the Obama administration. that said it would be strange for her to give up a political position in favor of a more bueaucratic one.
Yes, he understood it fully well by saying he'll train miners to be coders.
Fair, but I think managing sewer overflow is not really what people concerned about AI (one way or another) mean.
I think the buzzword you're looking for is IOT (internet of things). It kind of goes hand in hand with "AI" though, since IOT provides new data sources to implement new AI use cases down the line.
ooh, that’s definitely exciting
I think Amy would be good. She seems like your average mom, which people could connect to. Might be a good choice. We’ll find out.
Yeah but women don’t always vote for women. Pete could really bring in the young moderate voters
Sounds like a more thought out plan than “let’s cut welfare and give everyone a check”
Fair enough, I think my point was that he has some experience with it. And now I can say it out loud, but he's probably friends with some tech people (like Zuck) which can inform him much better than any of the septuagenarians.
Sounds like someone didn't research other candidates' policies.
No, I looked into Yang's UBI proposal. It cut welfare and that's why it was bad.
Yang does not want to force people off of the programs. Yang's vision is to leave programs in place until the recipients themselves decide to opt-in to the dividend. $1000 per month is the initial amount as full automation has not yet occurred (my personal opinion, it should be $500/mo to start). The amount will be increased as full automation occurs (not including other factors that may increase unemployment like outsourced jobs or increased competition for jobs due to a bigger population). When that happens, what recipient will want to stay on welfare getting a $700 a month benefit when let's say $1500 is the dividend amount after COLA adjustments? People can remain on them until it's no longer feasible for them to do so. Once the UBI amount is increased to far surpass the meager benefits humans are given to subsist on, everyone will opt-in for UBI. Opt-in UBI is a policy that can benefit the rich, the middle class, and the poor.   The average welfare payout is $500.00 with social workers looking under your bed and dictating the foods you eat. Most will choose freedom.
Florida poll shows Biden with staggering 44-point lead over Sanders
>The poll also has Biden ahead with Hispanics — 65 percent to 28 percent — breaking a run of success Sanders has had with Hispanics in other states.
I can see why Sanders want to stay in another week and suffer another round of humiliating defeats.  Aside from Florida, Biden leads in Arizona by 28, Illinois by 30, and Ohio (cannot find data).  It's going to be a rough night for Bernie.
18 year old here. Voted for Biden here in Florida last week. First time voting. One of the things that made me go Biden is as we're seeing in the primary. Biden is far more electable. Sanders is DOA in Florida.
So the Castro thing backfired, didn’t it.
Look at other polls on 538:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  **- Arizona -**  (Mar 4)  Biden 46%  Sanders 17%  &#x200B;  **- Florida -**  (Mar 10)  Biden 66%  Sanders 22%  &#x200B;  **- Illinois -**  (Mar 8)  Biden 56%  Sanders 26%  &#x200B;  **- Ohio -**  (Jan 21)  Biden 32%  Sanders 21%  &#x200B;  \------  Dates are when polls were conducted; it's very obvious Sanders is going to get murdered real hard. Why Bernie doesn't want to drop out now, is probably because he wants to debate Biden in a final hurrah this Sunday.  But Bernie not dropping out now means he's not dropping out with his head high; he's continuing to take money from his supporters to fuel their delusion that he's going to be the nominee.  Unlike Andrew Yang, who saw the writing on the wall and dropped out because Yang has character and did not want to continue to take money from supporters, when he knew that he was not going to win.  This is going to forever bite Bernie and his movement.  &#x200B;  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/arizona/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/arizona/)  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/)  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/illinois/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/illinois/)  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/ohio/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/ohio/)
If he wins that big, Bernie has to drop out.  He's getting trounced at this point, much worst than he was in 2016.
Sanders and his supporters refuse to admit they have a problem reaching minority voters and have done nothing to fix that.  This is why they are losing.
To paraphrase the once great Dennis Miller, Sanders is making McGovern look like William the Conquerer.  :-)
It's time to unite the party and focus on getting Trump the HELL out of office in Novemer.
When Cuban literacy backfires . . .
It's gonna be a 44 point lead over Trump soon. All the old Republicans are at a serious risk of dying or at least realizing he has no business leading America.
People underestimate how much Cuban American hate Castro
Bernie should drop out
In the days of the Hour Glass...These are the Days of Bernies Lives...
Hmmmm who would have thought praising a Cuban dictator would result in this???
Bernie knew it was over before his Super Tuesday loss.  But he wants to stay in the race so he can spread his Socialism-Lite agenda.  He's trying to drag Biden left just like he did Hillary.
I truly think the primary race is over barring any thing extraordinary (God forbid anything extraordinary interferes)  Bernie is in 5 more days to platform his issues at the debate and bow out gracefully  If (and only if) this prediction is correct, Bernie will go out with my respect
I wish the primary was on a Saturday, I may not have time to vote. But it looks like he doesn’t need it.
We can't have a Presidential candidate that is a lost cause in Florida. Bernie chose impressing the radical fringe over competing in one of the largest states in America.
If polls won elections, Hillary Clinton would be president right now.  We haven't won yet. Get out and vote. 👍
Yep... he’s gone.
I know people keep mentioning Cubans, but Florida is moderate overall, including the Democrats. They hated Sanders in 2016, and they hate him more now. Hillary won 60% in 2016 primary.   Biden will win this BIG, though I believe mail-in ballots have lots of Bloomberg (yes, thats right, if he stayed he may have won Florida). We have had our ballots for like a month, so I think that factor will take some votes from Biden.   - in south florida
I'm concerned how this virus will effect turnout. We have so many older people who might not feel comfortable voting now. And as far as I've heard they aren't rescheduling like Louisiana. I just plan to pop in and out early on Tuesday and make sure to sanitize before and after.
Sanders never did understand that Hispanics are not monolithic, that the Mexican Americans in the southwest are as different from the Cuban Americans in Miami as night is from day.
Too bad nobody in the Sanders camp listened to Andrew gillum when he offered them free advice:  https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1235580200227762176
thats a big oof if Bernie gets hit that bad in AZ- but he should have dropped out yesterday.
I can tell a little about Ohio, since it's my home state growing up and still have family there: it's incredibly purple, irrespective of the massive gerrymandering that happened in 2010. Democrats in Ohio are not the "revolution let's burn it down" type at all. They're pragmatic and most likely former Eisenhower-like Republicans. But today's Republican party is batshit insane, so they've been democrats since W.  It's also Hillary county. So this year it's very likely to be Biden country.
He already had two consecutive weeks of rough nights. He lost Minnesota, Massachusetts and Washington, states in which he was favored and he was thumped in Michigan, the state that gave his campaign a boost in 2016. From now on, it's an excercise in masochism for him. It's up to him to decide when enough is enough.
I'm a Bernie guy and I'm expecting he might drop on Monday with how Coronavirus is turning out.   He gave a swan song yesterday, that much is clear to us Bernie supporters who haven't drank the kool-aid.   He's setting up Joe to court his base in the debates on Sunday. Literally gave him the blue print.
The corn will vote for Biden. I guarantee it.
I’m guessing he drops out on Monday after the debate.
>  It's going to be a rough night for Bernie.  But a great night for us!
How the fuck can it be, that there is no data for Ohio? The MOST important state electoral wise.
Great job man!  Doesn't it pain you that the media likes to say Bernie is more popular with the youth? Yet when the past two Super Tuesdays came, his youth vote was hardly there? Lol.  I joked with my Michigander friend (a Biden & Yang supporter), that while Bernie likes to brag about having 10,000 supporters attend his rallies, the other 90,000 that doesn't attend his rallies ain't voting for him lol.
Biden also has more appeal to the working class and minorities.
maybe!  I think he should try again!  Praise Fidel's awesome beard and cool green uniform!
His position on AIPAC probably didn't help with Jewish retirees
It for sure didn’t help him. I vote absentee in Florida and I voted for Bernie (have been Team Biden for awhile now though), but I’ll say Bernie just never had appeal in Florida. Anyone from certain other subreddits who claim otherwise are being willfully ignorant. Polls going back months show it was either going to be Bloomberg (which wouldn’t have surprised me because Florida) or Biden.
You know I’m fine with Bernie going on because he want to spread his message through the debate. It’s one more week and I don’t really think it does anything but gives Biden a chance to speak to the American people.  But with numbers like we have I really wish some of the progressive media would stop feeding into the “fight to the end” and “here’s how Bernie can win” narrative, because there are people who will sit in an echo chamber and send Bernie hundreds of dollars under the belief there’s an actual chance.  I mean it’s their money and everything, but for young people to be spending so much on what amounts to a statistically zero chance of winning, it just makes me feel a little bad.
Some of them deserve it, to be honest. One dude donated $2800 on a credit card right after Super Tuesday. I was shocked as hell.
[removed]
They're so used to belittling Pete supporters for his low black support, they forgot they weren't doing that well themselves.
Yeah, WTF happened to Miller? Used to be so good on SNL
Credit where credit is due... that's an excellent comparison.
The worst thing about that was that the literacy program was part of Cubas brainwashing and indoctrination programs. Its like praising Maos re-education camps because they taught people to read.
Not just Cubans but all South americans. Castro exported his Marxist revolution to other Latin american countries. It goes way beyond just the Cubans in south florida.
And make him a weaker candidate in the general, just like with Hillary. Bernie Sanders made Donald Trump president.
He missed the gracefully window already.
This. We are not all the same. And south florida is not just Cuban but all over south america. This absolutely does not surprise me. As a latina from the s florida community I can tell you a large number of us have families who fled socialist countries, not just Cuba but Venezuela, Nicaragua etc..our family was forced to flee a socialist country. Socialist revolutionaries scare the hell out of many of us.
Exactly. Hundreds and possibly thousands of Cuban refugees have died attempting to flee Cuba. Can you imagine traveling on a make shift raft 90 miles at sea? Their situation must have been so dire
Does Sanders not understand that?
[removed]
If he had a big win coming up, or a state like NY, I could see staying in.  If he wipes out again in 4 big states next week, his support is going to evaporate.  NY isn't until April 28th, far too long to drag this dead race out.
He made his speech before WA switched.
I see him staying in till after Tuesday.  He has a chance in the debate and then can hope for an upset.  If he stays in longer than Wednesday he will be hurting Biden.  I think him staying for Tuesday and losing massively in 3 swing states will send a clear message to Bernie's base that they did not lose because the primaries are rigged, but because more people like Biden.
I was a Republican until around 2002, when I knew Bush was lying about Iraq.  I think the GOP has only gotten worse since then, but I know what you are talking about.
I concur.
You’ve summarized Ohio pretty well for the most part. I do see a lot of fanatical Trump supporters but I suspect there are a lot of people here tired of his shit. They also don’t want Bernie because they think what he wants to do is impossible or too much reach.  I don’t want to get my hopes up for a blue Ohio this year but with how shitty 2020 is going, I gotta have something to look forward to.
I hope you're right, but it sounds the opposite of my expectations from him.
Isnt Florida the most important electoral state? We have the biggest ec votes of alk the battlegrounds.
I know, right?
It's not the most important.  Are you still living in 2004?
I’m 19 and you can see by my flair that I was initially a Pete supporter. I was excited to vote for Pete for many reasons but now I’m excited that Biden is our presumptive nominee. I might not even have to vote for him considering the primary could be decided by the time my state votes. But Biden has always struck me as one of the most genuine, compassionate politicians. I’m also a person who’s never fallen for pie-in-the-sky fantasy plans. I’m very data-driven so when Sanders supporters insult me for going in-depth about why Sanders’ plans don’t work and *aren’t* the same plans that Denmark has, it really makes me not wanna primary for him.
Yeah tbh in my experience. I am in a somewhat conservative area and you know how young people can be influence by parents. I can only think of a few people my age who actually support Sanders. I say actually cause I know several people who like him cause of the memes but probably won't vote till the general. Granted I also know several people my age who just support Biden cause of Obama and he's the only vp aside from pence we can remember
Im 23 in Florida and voting Biden. I think Bernie is a fraud selling a lie to desperate and scared young people.
Your comment was auto-collapsed by the new Reddit anti brigading program. Tells you what the Bros think of your comment, eh?
The only thing that frustrates me is that it gives the Sanders crowd another week to attack our nominee and create division instead of pivoting to the general
Yea same.  Especially now, young people spending so much on this delusion when they need to save up for the damn coronavirus lol.  Damnit Bernie.
Wow what a fucking Bern-foon. (Buffoon)  &#x200B;  That dude just fucked himself of additional savings needed to withstand COVID's impact on his life lol.

Just to interject here:   There's a reason why he opposed it. You omit the portion where he's a supporter of the DREAM portion of the bill. Also, he wasn't alone and the League of United Latin American Citizens supported that decision.  https://www.latinorebels.com/2016/02/15/bernie-sanders-voted-against-immigration-reform-in-2007-and-was-right/  Exploitation of immigrant workers sounds pretty bad to me.
Truuuuuuuuuuuue, oh my god so true.
I'm black for reference and I almost get a white savior complex from some of Bernies supporters who act like us blacks don't know any better for not supporting Bernie.  That alone makes me jump on the Biden train even more.
9/11 scared him into being a xenophobic asshole, and he embraced the fox news crowd
I’ve seen an article in the last few weeks that argued that Cuban literacy was already estimated at about 75% pre-Castro, and that the 5% pre-Castro literacy was just a government propaganda number.   I would very much like to be proven right or wrong on this.
Exactly
Not true.  Bowing out right after Michigan would have been abrupt.  Like I said , lets see how he behaves at the debate, how Tuesday night goes , and what happens by Wednesday.  If he is in hard core attack mode at that debate I will then change my opinion.
Nevermind the amount of Puerto Ricans who moved to the mainland after the debacle of Maria.
Very true.  I didn’t mean to imply South Florida Latinos are all only Cuban, they just seem to have the greatest influence.  Miami is a true melting pot, with many South and Central American nations represented.  :-)
Hey, not relevant to this conversation, but what’s your opinion on latinx?
I worked at Gitmo in the 90s,  processing those refugees for citizenship and asylum.  It was heartbreaking.
https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/world/russia-ghana-troll-farms-2020-ward/index.html
The last poll in NY had Biden winning 48% and if you think about... wall street is in ny and bernie wants to take on wall street. I dont think he'll do that well there.
> his support is going to evaporate.  His support in 2016 seemed surprisingly robust in the face of crushing odds.
Im going to give him the benefit of the doubt. The debate could be a good way to set Joe up for his base.
There are multiple polls for Florida, none for Ohio.
It still was 2008 and 2012. They literally anounced Obamas win after he won Ohio.
vote anyway
I won't use the term fraud; but just pure delusional thinking lol.  Yea he and his campaign movement knows that seducing the youth with free college tuition and the rest of the country with free healthcare is what gets the not-really-educated people(even those who are supposedly educated with college degrees) to fall for him and vote for him. He preys on the vulnerable youth, desperate to get rid of their tuition debt and their insecurities.  &#x200B;  He began proposing his M4A and College tuition stuff without knowing how much it costs; and then when he finally got down to calculate, it wound up being in some insane trillions of dollars....  ...over 10 years lol. That shit ain't going to get passed in Congress, not even the Dems would pass that.  And he wants to tax the wealthy (including middle class upwards); the super wealthy got to be that amount of wealth purely because they knew how to evade taxes; why the fuck does he or his supporters think they wouldn't know how to run away from wealth tax increases either lol?  \-----  And also a funny thing; speaking as a Yang supporter, Bernie bros have straight up called Yang a fraud, conman, grifter and what not for making his UBI proposal of giving every adult American a free $1000 a month. And called us YangGang morons for believing Yang. Yet they don't bet an eye when they get offered free college tuition and healthcare promises lol.  But unlike Bernie, Yang did the math and calculate how to fund the UBI pragmatically, via the VAT system similar to what Europeans use. And with the ongoing coronavirus update, it seems UBI is now needed more than ever to stimulate the economy.  You now have people like former top Obama economics advisor Jason Furman endorsing UBI, and ironically, the same AOC that called UBI a trojan horse, now tweeted hours ago her endorsement of UBI lol.  That just goes to show people like AOC are just punk politicians with no idea what to do. All talk and fluff yet no substance. Whereas with Biden and Yang, there's some form of consistency.
[removed]
It also stops heavy hitters like Obama and the Clintons who are remaining neutral from endorsing and campaigning for Joe.
There’s a non-zero chance there will be plenty of Sanders supporter (real or trolls) will keep attacking the nominee well after Bernie drops out.
I actually felt this as a gay man, but from others in my own community. The lgbtq subs skew pretty young, so there's a lot of Bernie Bros, and they act like I want my rights taken away because I'm not voting for Bernie.  Then of course they bring up the video of Biden saying that he didn't support gay marriage. Yeah I remember, I watched that debate live. And I turned around and voted for his campaign, because I understand how politics works. If you don't get elected, it doesn't matter what you supported, you're done.  It's a shame that Bernie's campaign has gone so negative. It really sets the tone for his supporters.
It was more a move to try to capture a market of potential fans that didn't have a comic of their own. Miller, as well as most comedians, is a contrarian and libertarian at heart, so it made a lot of sense to see how he got there. Now he's appeared on Fox so many times that liberals won't give him the light of day anymore, so he's stuck.   Of course his act suffered, and he doesn't have the same appeal to his target audience the way Larry the Cable Guy does.
check out this interview on NPR. https://www.npr.org/2020/02/26/809741233/examining-bernie-sanders-comments-on-literacy-in-castro-era-cuba   The literacy rate was about 80% prior to Castro. Castro wanted it to be 100% But used the literacy program as a Marxist ideology indoctrination program
Yes. True. He has no chance. The people have spoken. And now his supporters are hoping coronavirus keeps old voters in Florida from speaking Tuesday.   Meanwhile in Ohio, the state is looking for poll workers to work Tuesday to cover all the voters coming through the polls (the numbers of which would be way lower if Sanders admitted what is plainly true: it's over). So that's happening. In the middle of a pandemic. The average poll worker is over 70, by the way.  Meanwhile, the president is flailing. And he'll be running against Biden. Not Bernie. Biden. That's done. And there's a debate that's only happening because Bernie hasn't accepted that. And if it goes well, it comes and goes like all such things do. But if Biden trips an inch or gives an answer that Fox News can use, it hurts his chances in November. Against Trump. Because Bernie can't accept the plain truth: he lost.
Yes there a lot of Puerto ricans as well and they have different issues from the South Americans. Trump didnt even know they were US citizens...
There were a lot of Puerto Ricans in Florida even before Maria.
Just remember south florida is more then Miami. Theres also Broward, Palm, and Monroe counties. Cubans are influential in Miami but once you get out of Miami and into other cities in Dade or up into Broward and Palm counties the demos shift. I know you didnt mean to imply all latinos in florida were cuban. I just want to point oit how damaging the socialist thing is here because we have so many south americans who have had problems with socialists. Socialisim is a hard sell to the Venezuelan couple who owns the bakery I go to, and its a hard sell to my Colombian neighbors. Even south american countries that arent socialist like Colombia have problems with communist guerilla groups like Farc. And the castro remarks... not helping Bernie.   I had read an article that said Biden was tailoring his latino outreach to each community were Bernie was going to use the same approach he did in Texas and California and I thought to myself...treating Caribbean and South Americans like Mexicans isn't going to work out well for him.  We have different issues. And not every Latino here cares about mexicans, I'm ashamed that some in our community are republicans who actually support the border wall and deportations. They got their citizenship and dont care for anyone else. It infuriates me.
I dont know any spanish speaking latino that uses it. It doesnt make sense in spanish. Spanish is a gendered language  and if you want an english gender neutral term then just use latin no need for the x. The only people Ive ever heard use that term have been english speaking whites.
Joe Biden Speaks on Coronavirus in Wilmington, Delaware
**New:**  [The Biden plan to combat Coronavirus (COVID-19) and prepare for future global health threats](https://joebiden.com/covid19/)
I felt so relieved during and after Joe spoke.  Calm, measured, thorough, blunt but comforting, presidential.  He had actual bulleted plans.  It had that tinge of, "Things are bad, but we will get through this."  I didn't know how much I was missing that.  I'm a Pete guy and was heartbroken when he dropped out, but I will gladly pull the lever for Joe on Tuesday.
God if this is the preview of his presidency, I will be able to SLEEP AT NIGHT
For the first time in 3 years I'm reminded what a competent and intelligent president sounds like when confronting a grave national emergency bluntly, honestly, and openly with bold plans that rise to the occasion.  If only Joe was in the White House right now.  Edit - or Hillary. We'd be so much better off right now if she'd won.
Biden: A vaccine should be available *free of charge.*
Good quote:  "Public health professionals must be the ones making our public health decisions."
This is what real, sane leadership looks like.  The problem is a whole lot of damage will be done before he is able to step in and help.
The ONLY one acting like a leader
Biden is speaking and acting like a true President. Can we skip to January 2021 already?
[Greg Sargent:](https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/1238157729639866370)  >Absolutely crucial that Joe Biden just called for *reliable* and *daily* updates on testing numbers.   >How do we not have this right now?
Just love it when he says "folks" and "here's the bottom line."
Biden is killing it IMO. So much better than last night's snort-fest where Trump looked *annoyed* that his virus was personally affecting his economy and election.
jOe BiDeN hAs DeMeNtIa  Seriously how the fuck can anyone hear this speech and think this man shouldn't be president?
Crazy to hear someone speak like a President after all these years
Biden: We need bold, compassionate, and smart leadership.
[Jennifer Rubin:](https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1238159287580602368)  >The White House should be humiliated not to have done the thing Biden describes. They are utter failures and Americans will die as a result.
I like how he acts like a president before he actually gets there. He's ready to lead
[Bakari Sellers:](https://twitter.com/Bakari_Sellers/status/1238157498235924482)  >This Biden speech is very good and Presidential. The contrast is stark.
"We will lead by science."  Yes.
Can we elect Mr. Biden and swear him in now?
This is what a president looks like when he addresses the nation. He’s not just reassuring but he’s comfortable confronting the truth and the facts. Even if it’s bad news.   Trump couldn’t shut up about how great Trump is. That was his speech about the virus.
Biden: The [Trump] administration's failure on testing is colossal.
Wow, I miss having a President...
["This is legitimately like looking into an alternate timeline where he’s President. This is what’s happening in the timelines where Beau didn’t die."](https://np.reddit.com/r/DemocratsforDiversity/comments/fhczaj/dfd_discussion_thread_march_12_2020/fkbl77f/)
THAT is how to address the nation.
For the first time in my life I have felt reassured and bolstered by a politician.
That’s my President.
God how I’ve missed someone sounding presidential and actually give a damn.
Joe is showing right now that he has the true leadership and decision making ability to lead our nation
I'm not going to lie im actually getting emotional this is so comforting hearing from an actually sane laeder
I’m proud to say that today I cast my vote for Joe Biden in the Florida primary.
It was a spectacular moment for Joe and such a great and comprehensive plan. I just wish so much he could actually do what he talked about. America doesn't have 10 months to wait. We need Joe now!!!
It's bloody hilarious that Biden is basically saying "I'll just take over as president right now, guys."
Joe Biden: We will lead by science.
November can't come soon enough. We need serious leadership, not clowns.
I like how he's calling it Covid 19, sounding professional
 See how he looks around when speaking, he doesnt need a prompter like Trump.
I'm watching, and it's a great speech so far. I'm coming from Team Pete, and Joe doesn't make me as calm as Pete did when he speaks, but Joe is growing on me. I'll happily vote for him in November. After last night's address from 45 and so many cancellations, postponements, etc today... at least Joe's speech is a bit of relief.  This is the president we NEED in the White House.
I'm hoping he explicitly calls out Elizabeth Warren's early work on plans for Corona, both as a candidate and as a Senator. She is pushing for thinking about issues (like containing Corona in prisons) that frankly many folks are ignoring. And I think the best message for Democrats going forward is - we're the party of competence, through and through, and we're all going to pull together to generate the best ideas.
Wow, this a very effective speech. Already taking charge and acting like the president we need right now.
“Fuck it! I’ll be the president!” -Biden
Cant watch...hows the speech
Joe sounds like a leader who is ready on day 1. November can't come fast enough.
I nearly cried watching this because I’ve been so yearning these past few years and particularly now for leadership like this.
Lead by science. Fucking makes me want to cry. Trump has enabled the worst of the worst, not just in the US but all over the world. Biden is the adult that needs to be in the WH. This is a leader. It's like he already is president.
Joe Biden is speaking right now.
Some good graphs here about the virus:   [https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/12/21172040/coronavirus-covid-19-virus-charts](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/12/21172040/coronavirus-covid-19-virus-charts)
Will also be on CNN if somebody prefers a tv broadcast.
Looks like their microphone has the covid. Wish they'd done A/V dry runs a little earlier.
They're replacing one of the mics with what appears to be a body mic.  Duct tape ✅
market instantly up 4% hahahahah FUCK YOU TRUMP
The moment Senate Republicans blocked a sick leave bill, Democrats should’ve been on television IMMEDIATELY and shout from the mountaintops ‘MITCH MCCONNELL AND HIS REPUBLICANS WANT YOU TO DIE.’ Yeah, it’s unrealistic, they’ll never say that, but some people need to get this drilled into their heads!
More duct tape plz ✅
HOT MIC
Imagine!  A President wanting to lead with Science and confront a public health crisis on advice from public health experts!  I'm honestly getting flashbacks to 2008 here and the financial crisis.  Both happened in an election year and were surprise shocks to the economy.  At least 2008 didn't involve people dying, but much of the blame was placed on the current President at the time.  And the candidates had to show how they would handle such a situation.  In fact, how Obama responded to the Lehmann Brothers crash, by remaining calm and consulting experts, is one of the things I cited to others as to why I was voting for him.  It's the calm, reassuring demeanor in a crisis that we've been missing so much.
This is why Bernie has no path. Joe's speech is going to be everywhere in the news, because he's already being covered as the presumptive nominee. More free media of "Biden being presidential" will thump any type of coverage that Bernie could get from a debate that will not have an audience and will not provide him with the "made for tv moment" that would otherwise desperately need to overcome a 20+ point deficit.  I hope Bernie does the right thing and drops on Wednesday because at some point, he needs to take into consideration that asking his loyal supporters for more money to support a candidacy that has no path is unwise to say the least.
Is anyone else having trouble with the YouTube version?
Did it start yet? the campaign feed on youtube is still on the coming soon stream
Man, cut the live feed off. The whole world doesn't need to hear the AV guy freaking out.
Biden has a calm collective speech all about solutions and reassuring people at the same time. Reminds me of Obamas demeanor. Imagine Bernie doing this. ‘ my fellow Americans. Testing should be free right? FUCK BILLIONAIRES’ guy is a joke
I love Joe, but fucking hell, what is wrong with these people. Live stream should be turned OFF. You’re in politics, learn what a hot mic is.   This will be just another stupid thing for republicans to blast him over & on the heels of his great speech on Tuesday.
Last minute mic checks are being done
JFC I had almost forgotten what a real president sounds like.
This is some serious malarky
[removed]
This is it. This is what only Joe can offer in a moment like this one. Joe said exactly what America needed to hear, what Trump could not. He was honest, he treated us like adults, he let us know we're all in this together, every citizen must stand in a united front to combat this threat to our families and communities.   &#x200B;  It should be mandatory to watch Trumps response and Bidens response to this crisis before anyone is allowed to cast a ballot. People need to be reminded what \*real\* leadership is. How a \*real president\* responds to a threat.  &#x200B;  It feels like the last few years have been a fever dream. I just want to have a functional government again. Never in my life could I have imagined just how important it was to me until it was taken away.
Is Joe purposely slowing his speech to stutter less? Less gaffes but sounds emotionless now.
God bless our troops?

...And you know the people that Joe taps to manage these things directly will be experts and professionals.  I don't have that same confidence now.

Maybe the eye twitch before I check my phone will stop!
The first three words - "My fellow Americans" - and you realize what we've been so desperately missing.
[removed]
>*free of charge!*
I don't understand how a vaccine can be charged ? What would be the point ?
The reparations are going to be large, but hey, we are in the UNITED states !
That was extremely presidential.
If the election was tomorrow I bet Joe would win judging by the lead he has in national polls. Sucks we have to endure almost a whole year of misinformation campaigns before the election.
RIGGED.  FAKE NEWS.  /s
I'm a Bernie supporter and the whole Joe Biden dementia thing is a disgrace. It doesn't hold up to the slightest scrutiny. It's all quick clips or out right doctored videos.   It's absolutely appalling that the Bernie sub and Bernie Twitter heads kept pushing that narrative.  Watch the whole unedited clips and you'll figure out it's all desperate bullshit.
Someone else pointed out it indirectly helps Biden. By setting the bar so low as soon as they hear him speak anyone with a brain will quickly realize it's a BS narrative.
Hilariously, they’re attacking him over using a teleprompter. Which is exactly what republicans did to Obama in 2009. Exactly.
Yeah, Joe sounded good.  This will put those rumors of him having dementia to rest.
A lot of things that are said about Biden's speech is pretty ableist.
"Medicare for all!"
"Serious Leadership" might be a good campaign motto
I'm glad to see it but I'm afraid it'll be too late by then!
The failure doesn't even make sense logistically... The Trump administration had literally two months of warning to plan for this and we're having trouble with TESTING?? Are you kidding me!
I want to live in that timeline.
Same. Biden was awesome and as a side bonus just made an utter fool of Trump.
Who would have thought a global pandemic would require science!?
He keeps hitting the same spots to the left and right, but he reads ahead, keeps talking, and doesn't have trouble finding his place.  He doesn't lose his place and wing it, and he doesn't sound like a teenager forced to read an apology.
You don't like it when Trump says "CUUURONAAHH.......uh...*sighs*.......V-EYE-RUSSS"??? /s
I think he actually does, but unlike Trump, he actually knows how to use a prompter so you can't tell he is using one.
Good catch. Also noticed he actually knows the Constitution !
This is how you lead
[Cory Booker] The answer to hatred & division is to reignite our spirit of common purpose. Joe Biden won’t only win - he’ll show there's more that unites us than divides us. He’ll restore honor to the Oval Office and tackle our most pressing challenges. That’s why I’m proud to endorse Joe.
We have the vegans now! Dairy free ice cream for all who want it!
So, of former candidates, it goes:  Biden: Pete, Amy, Harris, Delaney, Patrick, Booker, Beto, Bloomberg, Ryan  Bernie: Williamson, de Blasio  Yikes.
This is a nice sight to see, from a Booker -> Biden voter.
Booker is such a positive dude.  Another great addition to the team.
As a fan of alliteration, Biden Booker has a ring to it.
Can we all agree that we have so many awesome VP candidates? Who could Bernie possibly run with that wouldn’t isolate his base besides Warren (who is a capitalist).
Avengers assemble!
[deleted]
Man, I love Cory Booker. I was really surprised his campaign didn't catch on. In such a crowded and talented field, he may not have won, but I was damn surprised he struggled as hard as he did, especially when he was keeping it real.
Both Pete and Booker endorsing Biden because of his compassion, positivity and ability to bring unity.  The coalition continues to grow.
Gotta love Cory! It's worth taking a look at his Baby Bonds proposal to fight wealth inequality and give everyone a fairer start: [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/22/17999558/cory-booker-baby-bonds](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/22/17999558/cory-booker-baby-bonds)  Yes, a proposal to address inequality that is based in positivity and real research rather than just demonizing some fraction of the company and hoping that will solve things. Another great fit for Team Biden!
As a Cory supporter up until he dropped out, this is great.
CORY!  OK, *now* I'm buying the shirt.
That's my Senator! Cory was my second choice until he dropped out and I'm looking forward to voting for him in November.
cory booker in the house
Cory is my second choice for VP behind Amy. Biden/Booker also just sounds cool
Cory Booker was my first choice and is still the campaign that I've donated the most to.  He preached a message of radical love where loving your opponent is the hardest thing to do, but it was the right thing to do to bridge the gap that's shown up in America both within and across party lines.  For me, he was the first unity candidate and his values are something that I was constantly reminded of in Pete's campaign and now in Bidens campaign.  He's a very compelling speaker who I think can be a huge help on the campaign trail, and I couldn't be happier to have seen this endorsement this morning.
Yesssssss! I love Pete but I’d be totally happy with Cory as VP too
[removed]
Thank you, Corey! I'll never quite understand why your campaign never took off in any way.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@mods can we get a Cory for Joe flair?
The Joe-alition grows!
This is the type of content I need right now.
Yeah! Go Joe! Really like Booker as well.

There it is.

Bald men too.
Forgot Bloomberg lol  also Amy and klob are the same person
Why would de Blasio endorse Bernie anyway? Is it because the one thing they share in common is that no one else likes them?
How could you forget Bernie’s biggest endorsement yet?! Beto’s former college bandmate!
You forgot Gravel for Bernie. Though he (or his teenage handlers) endorsed both Tulsi and Bernie because he couldn't decide.
None of this matters until the Wayne Messam endorsement comes in.
Seriously , Bernie could not even get Warren
Seth Moulton endorsed Biden. Mike Gravel co-endorsed Sanders and Gabbard
Tulso remains....the most imp fox news one
There are dozens of us! DOZENS!
Me too!
My people!
I was a Pete guy but only because he was able to stay in the race longer. Cory would have made my decision difficult. He's too good for us.
If we're going to have a male VP, Booker is up there for me.
Biden Bernie. Biden Buttigeig. Biden Bloomberg. Lot of B’s this election cycle.
Marianne Williamson 🙄
[deleted]
Yang?
I think Pete would be the best option but I am biased. I think Amy’s experience on the hill could also be invaluable to making sure deals got done.
We will have a gay president before a vegan, unfortunately. We just aren't quite ready for that one.
same. i was kind of hoping for pete, but man cory would be a great choice too
I think there were too many talented and qualified candidates, so it was hard to stand out. Biden has a lot of name recognition alone, on top of a long, solid, political career.
I wasn't thrilled about a couple things with his Senate career, but damn did I ever miss him in the debates after he dropped out.
I feel like he was another candidate who lost the moderate lane to Pete.
That’s one of those things I really loved this cycle, the sheer amount of research some candidates had put into their proposals, instead of waving their arms and yelling about a revolution. I got a nerdy hard on over some of Pete’s proposals, every time I saw copious footnoting.
I want the senators and reps to stay put.
His VP needs to be a black woman. Demings or Abrams. We also don't need any reps from blue states, he should pick a woman of color from a swing state... like Abrams or Demings.
He is also vegan right? Love me some Booker
Shocked if Joe does not go to the other gender
he reminds me of the politician version of  chris traeger from parks and rec lol
[removed]
Or Booker for Biden  That alliteration thooo
I've passed it along!
I would love that. I hope it’s at least under serious consideration.
Joementum continues! This is how you build a winning coalition.
There is no male equivalent of Hillary Clinton and there is no female Trump.  That sounds like the type of check box stuff that leads to saying Michael Bloomberg is the devil and ignoring people's fallibility and by extension failing to see their strengths.  This is not Trump in 2016 as a candidate, this is incumbent Trump who everybody knows well. It's a new ballgame . He has incumbent advantage and come November he may or may not also have a strong economy aiding his reflection chances.   I mean... Was Obama the *previous* Hillary Clinton ? :)   Biden is doing better than Hillary in a lot of regions already
ok
!mods this is malarky
I'm both AND I love as well as Cory.. I feel truly indulged today.
NYC mayors trying to hitch their wagons to populist movements seems like a thing.
OMG. THAT'S A HUGE ENDORSEMENT. THE ESTABLISHMENT ARE ABOUT TO BE DESTROYED. YIPPEE!!
What about Vermin Supreme??
u/irony_tower come get your alt
why the hell won’t she just endorse someone? especially with michigan coming. does she not want either to win?
Trump B gone soon!
🅱ennet!
Beto!
Tulsi Gabbard? Oh please no.
at s4p they Love that combo
Too controversial.
Demings with Joe would probably win over ex-republicans cause you have cross appeal with Joe meets Demings law and order
Biden's VP should be someone covering his weaknesses to bring in more votes; having a black women won't help much as Biden has already gotten the black votes as we have seen. Strengthening strengths while leaving weaknesses unfortified is a surefire way of getting Trump re-elected.  Someone young and fresh but still a POC like Andrew Yang would be better fit, considering that Yang has a diverse following from ex-Berners to ex-Trump voters to independents to previously-politically-apathetic voters. Biden's weakness is now the youth and more progressive voters; something that Yang can also achieve considering how Yang was the 2nd choice for many Bernie and Warren supporters; so he can rally those voters into Biden in the general too.  &#x200B;  P.S. Both Biden and Yang seem to exchange personal phone calls with one another like every 1-2 weeks, most recently early last week. However Yang isn't endorsing anyone yet unless they adopt UBI in their policies.  Now if you are skeptical of Biden adopting UBI, consider that days ago Harvard Economics Professor Jason Furman, a former top Obama economics advisor, espoused UBI days to help combat the economic effects of the coronavirus: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-a-big-coronavirus-stimulus-11583448500](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-a-big-coronavirus-stimulus-11583448500)  So presumably both Furman and Biden would had worked together before, and he may be in a better position to convince Biden to work things out with Yang to hopefully earn his endorsement.
I hope that the decision about VP is not made on this basis. There are more than enough qualified female options for gender to not be a factor. It would be nice to know that the first female VP was not a diversity hire.
But here’s the thing. We all believe that the BEST chance to hold congress and the Supreme Court is a Biden win in the primary. Biden is a life-long dem that actually works with Republicans. Bernie is using the dem name just so he’s not blown out as a third-party.

If the VP needed to be a male, I'd definitely want him.   (Beto as a close 2nd)
The first interview I saw with him he boldly rolls out "delicious" in describing the fabric of diversity.  I thought, "this guy is going somewhere".
What about Bloomberg?
He's waiting on whether Bernie picks him as VP
Florida Kingmaker! Wayne could tilt this election to his whim with a single sentence. When Wayne speaks, Florida listens.
Maybe she doesn't want to alienate anyone; her choices are either a toxic movement, or a movent that doesn't align as much with her policy platform. I don't blame her for staying out of it.
I don't think she needs to, and I don't think the reasons for her going either way are clear-cut enough.  Her supporters will make up their own minds.
Because she has no reason to, just like Obama
As a former Pete supporter I find it offensive that the same community calling my guy a "Rat Face " now expects me to jump to their ship.

80% of me is voting for Biden over Bernie due to policy.  But I'd be dammed if I didn't say 20% of me is voting for Biden purely because of the hate and vitriol coming out of the 'My way or the high way' Bernie Camp. Totally insufferable.  Edit: I voted for Bernie in the 2016 Primary.
I hear you. When Kamala dropped out, the 'KamalaIsACop' crowd didnt stand a chance to get my vote.  Biden is a decent man, and his policies are great, so here I am😍
Here's how I'm currently looking at it:   Bernie's entire campaign and the plurality of his supporters have become exclusionary to ideas and people who don't 100% align with the purity Bernie demands (which he rarely meets himself, but that's another issue).    Biden's campaign is imperfect, as is Joe himself, but they seem much more willing to open the tent and allow a spectrum of ideas and types of people become a part of it.  That's how you fucking win an election.     It's going to be much easier to push Biden to the left than it will be to get Bernie to compromise on anything or put a stop to the toxicity.    I'm still of the belief that Pete was the best person running in 2020, but I'll take cooperation over combativeness any day, and the people who support Bernie have become ugly on the inside.
I dont think redditors know that they are actively losing votes for Bernie
It’s a cult, just like Trump. They’ve been calling him Mayor Cheat and Rat Face since Iowa, and now demand allegiance to Sanders.
I am so sorry you’ve had to deal with this. I supported Sanders in 2016 and I feel somewhat responsible for this since I helped make him bigger than he ever should have been with my vote.  Now, though? Joe’s the way.
Sorry about that, the Sanders people have been horrible to everyone. They are especially bad when your candidate drops out.   The best thing to do is report them and move on. Don’t give them air and maybe the movement will suffocate.
I've given up with Reddit politics. I mean, I know I'll still post and read there but I shouldn't because it makes me ***so mad***.  I am a Pete supporter. My second choice was Klobuchar, but since she was non-viable (and now dropped out) I plan to vote Biden. There are some issues I have with him, just as there were some (different) issues I had with Pete. I don't line up 100% with any one candidate and that's fine.  I don't even try to argue people out of voting Sanders. I might chime in that yes, there are people who do actually support Biden when they claim there aren't any, that I'm one of them. As soon as I say something like that, though, it's knives out, with people accusing of me being a racist and wanting to put brown children in cages and I'm an awful person. Excuse me? I guess the argument in their mind is that only Bernie can win, therefore anyone who doesn't vote for Bernie in the primary is equivalent to someone who is voting for Trump and therefore automatically a racist, etc.  I don't know if it's bots or what. Probably it's just a very vocal minority. It is the most off-putting thing ever, and being bashed for being a moderate does make me want to go, "You know, screw you, if Bernie wins the nomination I just won't vote because you guys are jerks!" I won't, because that's an emotional response and I'm rational, I'll vote for whoever gets the Democrat nomination at this stage. But goddamn, it's like they're ***trying*** to turn voters away from their candidate.  One of Trump's tweets this afternoon is playing to that rabid Bernie-or-bust voter, saying that "they're staging a coup against Bernie!" I wonder if the Bernie-or-busters realize they sound ***just like Trump*** when they talk.
> Bernie and Trump are polar opposites politically, but the differences between their supporters are getting harder to differentiate.  Both camp takes clue from the top, you can see the same angry, hate filled and conspiracy spewing rhetoric from candidate, campaign staff, surrogates and supporters.   Pete and Yang both have lots of young supporters, but you rarely see toxic behavior from them, because their candidates (who are half Bernie's age btw), have shown maturity, decency and grace expected out a leader of millions of people.   Don't take their criticism or hypocrisy to heart. Hopefully better candidate will win the primary and GE. Pete would be back playing bigger role in the party, not so far in the future.
Im exactly the same. Biden is the only reasonable choice now that Klobuchar is gone
I've been a Pete supporter almost since day 1, and have donated well over $500 to Pete so I've put my money where my mouth is. To say that the Biden supporters have been among the nicest and most supportive of people among virtually any of the campaigns would be an understatement. Choosing Joe likely wasn't hard for Pete, and it hasn't been hard for me either. I'm still trying to get over Pete dropping out, and it hurts a little still, but god damn I'm pumped to be here and I feel like all the endorsements rolling in from Pete, Beto, Amy, etc are energizing the hell out of Biden's campaign after that rock star performance in South Carolina.
Maybe this will be a waste of my carpal tunnel but for people who say it’s only the Internet with these toxic Sanders supporters it’s not. I have sadly been affected by the toxicity on a personal level   I had a friend who came and lived with me in my parents house inObama '08 just so she could make a difference in PA versus being in New York City. My parents were somehow ok with it even to have a girl from high school I hadn't seen in years stay there in a truly platonic way.  Election ends and a few years later she starts a progressive Facebook group which I gladly join. From 2011-18 it grew from a few dozen to over 5,000 people as essentially, a Bernie Sanders page.  We get to the Kavanaugh hearings and by then she's just the stereotype of a triggered progressive as is most of her group.  Huge Bernie supporters. During the hearings I see a post about they (women) are done ever listening to a man's opinion again because it doesn't matter. All men are the same. I bit on this and frankly just stated along the lines of  "isn't that the type of mentality women have been fighting against for decades that men didn't listen to your opinion? How is this any better"?  I had dozens of women calling me a rapist. Private messages. Attempts at doxxing. Threatening me. Calling my wife a submissive whore who I must abuse. You name it.  And the same friend who stayed at my parents house for 6 weeks and thanked me the night Obama won for letting her be the change?  Told me I deserved it and that maybe next time, I shouldn't side with a rapist.  And then proceeded to harass me for nearly a week that I'm not a woman so my opinion has no value.  I had to eventually block her and have excommunicated her.  That's the types of experiences I've seen from Sanders supporters and know others that have received the same type of treatment. I don't even dislike Sanders the politician, though his social media accounts absolutely try to feed this hysteria.  But the only type of comparison to give to many of the Sanders supporters I've encountered is Trump-esque.
The funny thing is all of the people who harass and spam for Bernie won’t even show up to vote.
I know what you mean. They couldn’t have found a better way to make me run away from them.
As I said [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fcdoyv/pete_buttigieg_mulling_endorsement_of_joe_biden/fjaj65j/) referring to a future for Pete in a Sanders administration:  >Sanders supporters won't go for Pete. He's convenient right now. They're like the incels who are all "oh hi, you're so pretty, you want to go get dinner on friday" and then when told the person has other plans it's all "fuck off ugly hag, I was just doing that on a dare, like I'd ever want you".  >You look at the Biden people, it's more like "Hey, so I like Biden as #1, and Pete talks good, but doesn't quite have the experience. Give him a decade more, and he'll be a contender." That changes the analogy response to "Oh, bummer. Well, I plan on eating dinner in the coming fridays, just let me know if something opens up".  While I could see an exception with the commercial that dropped right after the NH debate, the level of venom from Sanders' camp was an order of magnitude higher.  It's also bad enough that the Pete sub [has a post that's #3 right now](https://old.reddit.com/r/Pete_Buttigieg/comments/fce65a/bernie_supporters_stop_trying_to_convert_us_on/) telling the Sanders fans to bugger off.
And now they'll have a new focus for their lies, disinformation, and name calling.  Be prepared.  We who supported Pete have our Rules of the Road (ROTR) we have followed, and I'd love to continue that.  But I won't put up with hypocrisy without downvoting it and pointing it out where I can  [Like this hypocrite.](https://i.redd.it/7dhvphwaiak41.jpg)
Thats who Sanders supporters are... They are no better then Trump supporters. Attacking everyone who even dares to say anything bad about Sanders.   But dont worry their arrogance will also be there downfall just like in 2016. As the race will become more of a 1v1 between Biden and Sanders you will see even more toxic behavior from them.
>Bernie and Trump are polar opposites politically, but the differences between their supporters are getting harder to differentiate.   There's a term for this! It mimics [horseshoe theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory).
Exactly. Sanders is the Trump of the Left. He has an angry mob following him, has a boogeyman that he blames for everything (billionaires), and is promising the world without any real plan for how to accomplish it. As a former Yang guy, I'll probably go with Biden. I don't agree with him on a lot of things, but he at least seems more realistic. And I think there's a chance he'll bring Yang into his cabinet.
> Bernie and Trump are polar opposites politically   Not on trade, protectionism, and high-skilled immigration. They are virtually identical.
In HS I loved Sanders- this old, Independent progressive Senator from Vermont? What's not to love? In 2016, I caucused for him and he won our (now) deep Red state in a landslide. Then as it got closer to the nomination, he changed his tune a bit, or at least turned up the volume and fanaticized his followers- perhaps in desperation. I started to have misgivings. The last three years have seen him take part in the ineffective, hyperpartisan Senate. All the while, this great divide keeps widening between the parties' "platforms", with Sanders&Co. digging more and more on their side. Him and Warren have turned their followers into Anti-Trump SJWs the same way Trump built up his Anti-Obama xenophobic nationalists. His followers and colleagues trying to drum up support is as disgusting, disrespectful and unethical as Cruz and Rubio and Graham (wtf happened there?) rallying for Trump.
Welcome!
Me to can’t wait to see what they say about Amy
I don't think all Sanders supporters are like this, but there is a vocal portion that is very toxic. Tho I feel you should vote based on the candidate and not it's supporters. That is why I chose to support Biden. I think he is what our country needs.
As a Sanders supporter, I've tried repeatedly to warn them that the vitriol towards other candidates that could otherwise end up as supporters was totally self defeating. Some of these people are such spiteful morons...
Even though I wasn’t a Buttigieg supporter, whenever I saw people attacking him for stupid shit like that, I always put in my two cents to try to shut them up
I think with candidates that have extreme policies, you see then attracting the same kinds of people. Sure, Bernie may be a democratic Socialist and Trump may be anti-liberal and Alt-Right, but they both appeal to less-educated, working class folk. There’s a reason you saw so many Bernie-or-Busters go for Trump in 2016. The major deciding factor between Berners and Trumpers is social issues, but I think many can overlook social policy they dislike if they get the sort of anti-establishment populist politics they’re looking for.

Same.
Happy cake day. Fellow former Pete person here and feel the same way. The toxicity is unbearable.
Well I was willing to vote for any of them except Bloomberg until those actual candidates engaged in racist and anti semitic red scare tactics. Obama was always better than dog whistle politics.
Amen Brother.
Same, their frequent  cruelty means I will only support Bernie  if he get the Nomination which I would seriously hate.  Go Joe!!
I'm more left politically, and Pete was the sweet spot candidate for me (amongst other reasons why I supported him).  But regarding Biden versus Bernie, it should be common sense to trust a decent, honest person with the character and record to back that up even if I don't always agree with them over someone who's consistently done nothing for the last 30 years but somehow think they deserve to win because they promised people everything under the sun.
Pete is rat face? What drug are they on?   Not just on Reddit, in most media. For example, I get the debate pundits don’t like him because he doesn’t give them much to drive up the tv ratings, but at least they should recognize that, out of all the candidates, Biden, and Pete as well,  are the only ones that consistently showed respect to the debate rules and the moderators.   And of course, instead of that, pundit criticize Biden for not fighting to win.
Careful of the Russian trolls in this thread.  Lots of anti Bernie sentiment trying to say if Biden loses, you should stay home.  We need to unify no matter what to defeat Trump
They don’t care about you. They just want you to know you are wrong and that you owe them your vote.
Pete had me hooked solid by the second week of March, last year, and at the time I had been considering Sanders, but the more I saw how Sanders’s supporters acted, how his rallies went, and how it took him forever to disavow anything his “bro’s” were doing, well, for months now I have seen Sanders and Trump as two sides of the same coin, and a counterfeit coin to boot.  I’ve been studying candidates for over 55 years, comparing their promises, their body language, their repetitions, and their attacks with or without the use of truth (mostly without), and it has helped me to understand their character in short order.  Neither Sanders nor Warren would get anything accomplished, both of them being far too confrontational to garner support, even from some congressional Democrats.  Bloomberg and Gabbard have created reputations for themselves (remember Tulsi declining to vote on Trump, or “stop and frisk”?) so poor they should never even considered running.  I’m glad that Klobuchar finally saw the light, but had hoped Pete would at least see how Super Tuesday would fare for him (I saw where he still got about 10% in California), so who does that leave?  I’m still trying to decide if I even want to go to my state’s caucus next week.  Losing Pete hit a lot harder than I expected.
Okay, before we even talk about this, can you prove who anyone over the internet actually is? Shouldn't you first be sure of your primary sources before using your evidence to make any kind of actual decision? Shall we also perform a statistical count of the Bernie supporters insults versus those of other candidates, supporters, and then Trumpians, then compare authenticity based on the two studies juxtaposed (identity and quantity, basically) ? There are crazy people everywhere, and this is a huge platform of misinformation and subversive use of social media with regards to information. Without this kind of data, anecdotal information isn't really that useful is it? Just an opinion from someone who has to do research all day, no offense meant to anyone.
A few supporters are toxic on all sides. I don't see Sander's supporters as any different than other Democratic candidates. If you go on Sanders Reddit site you will find that all are welcoming as they are here. Remember in the end we need to come together to defeat Trump.

I love the "nOw iS nOt tHe TiMe tO fIgHt, wArReN dRoP oUt aNd gEt bEhInD bErNiE" like they're not the ones who threw a hissy fit when Clinton beat him and refused to back her.
Honestly, the petty part of me is thinking that if Sanders gets the nomination it's win-win: Either Trump is voted out, or Sanders supporters see that he ***can't*** defeat Trump in a general election. (Though the most vitriolic of the Sanders supporters will stand around shouting that it's because things were rigged or the boomers are racist assholes or whatever their complaint is.)
Agreed.  Lieberman's final shank to America on the ACA still showed that while it wasn't perfect, Biden knew that good wasn't the enemy of great, and the ACA still became law, even if it wasn't ideal.
>Edit: I voted for Bernie in the 2016 Primary.  Me too! And now my top priority in a candidate is that they aren't Bernie Sanders. For a lot of reasons, but getting sick of the awful behavior from his supporters was what made me look into Bernie more and realize how many other problems I have with him.
Thank you for coming around!
Same here. Was Richardson, then Obama. Then Sanders, Clinton.  Now it's Pete and Joe. It's all love baby
I also voted for Bernie in 2016, then ultimately Hillary. He and his following have lost a majority of us. This isn't what the Democratic party stands for. If "Democratic Socialists" want a revolution then they should start their own party and get out of ours. I'm sick of losing and it's time to make American's proud of saying "I'm a Democrat". We need to lead by addition and inclusion, just what I've learned being a Pete supporter the last year. Join us. We want you on our side and we'll be better for it. We can do this. Edit: I'm a millennial with student loan debt.
It's like Trump's cousin running for the Democrat party!
You couldn’t describe my feelings better. I am A pete supporter since March 2019 and coming to Biden now, Also voted for Bernie in 2016
I feel the exact same way.  Being in college is tough politically right now as my campus is around 95% Bernie supporting, but I've explained why I'm supporting Biden and they've abandoned their quest to convert me.
 >Edit: I voted for Bernie in the 2016 Primary.  I voted for Bernie two days ago and can't stand those people.   I'll go back to lurking now.
Kamala was my frontrunner for a while before Pete announced. I missed her when she dropped out. Disagreed with some of her policy positions but I could always count on her to call out bullshit that needed to be called out.

This is the way.
Same.
Ditto. It's no wonder Sanders isn't doing as well as he did in 2016.
Any examples you can point to?  Everything I see on the front page has been "thanks for running a great campaign"
Are you trying to drive folks away from supporting Biden if he wins the general?  If so your tone is a great way to create divisiveness.
Trump is absolutely stirring the pot to make things worse. What I hate is seeing ANYONE who wants a better country buying in on it.
I liked Amy and Tom, but still would've had trouble voting for them. They don't have the executive experience. Although Pete's was small scale and Biden's limited to the VP (I wish Inslee ran), at least they know how to execute laws and foster cooperation in committees and arbitrate b/n civilians and government officials. Biden and Pete were the only two **Presidential** candidates, so now Biden is our last hope.
Same for me. I'm not yet ready to beat any drums yet, but I like what I see here versus elsewhere. I hope like hell that a guy like Pete can help push this guy where he needs to be and Joe would be wise to pay attention and ease my reservations. But unity is what we pushed for and unity is what we need. We don't have time to be bickering, we can't have a contested convention, we can't have a long protracted fight. THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT more months until we have to defeat Donald Trump. Look how quick this primary went. Before we know it this year is going to be over. Do we want to waste half our time with infighting.  Alright, I think I talked myself into it. I'm still stinging, but let's do this #TeamPeteforJoe
Hey man, I’m really sorry that happened to you. I’m really sorry. As a Bernie supporter, I know what those people did was wrong, and feel bad that they represent the camp I’m in to you. Good luck to you.
It feels like these people have been brainwashed into thinking the worst about 'other side' (whether it be republicans or moderate/conservative democrats).
Holy shit, it sounds like your ex friend joined a cult like scientology.
[Looks like ROTR is here now!](https://i.imgur.com/1j64tBe.png)
I think it's just the vitriolic and vocal minority, not the majority of Sanders pointers, but they sure are souring my opinion on the whole lot of them with how loud and obnoxious they are.
It's not fair to make blanket statements about Sanders supporters. There are many who are vocal toxic, but there are also many who are vocal, but not toxic and there are even more who are not vocal at all.
is this why the far left and far right both hate jews?
I came from MAGA to Yang. Does Joe have any similar policies at all?
The same populist nonsense.
Exactly. They’re both incredibly isolationist and just don’t have the foreign policy chops to cut it as commander in Chief.
The far-left and far-right have a lot more in common than the middle.
Economically they are fairly far apart, but politically? Holy hell there haven't been a closer pair of authoritarians in a long long time
Horseshoe theory.
Exactly. I tweeted in support of Biden last night, woke up this morning to dozens of mentions and tweets calling me out as a republican. They also name checked Obama as a republican.   If you ever want me to vote blue no matter who, this kind of behavior and vicious calling out of people for different views has to STOP.
I may disagree with ur choice but I wish ppl held this sentiment more.

Definitely take internet comments with a grain of salt.      But even looking at Bernie himself, the billionaire narrative is so disingenuous and misleading.       Then, when Pete drops out, every other candidate complimented Pete's campaign and wished him the best. Bernie used it as an opportunity to self promote and to be a part of "real change", it felt so Trumpian.
I subscribe to all the candidate subreddits I can find. The Bernie subreddits are only welcoming so long as you agree with them. They have no tolerance for dissent. And they have zero plans to come together to defeat Trump unless Bernie is the nominee. Double standards are their norm.
I believe everyone would be in a better position so that's why I'm not going to vote for anyone except Bernie so that I can fuck over tons of people just so I can appear ideologically pure   But tell me again how only Bernie supporters are compassionate towards the poor and children in cages.
The Bernie campaign being screwed by a candidate with no shot of winning who won't drop out is truly justice so sweet it was worth waiting four years for it.
I’ve been thinking this sort of thing. Like, if it’s Trump v Sanders, i know that at least one group of supporters I loathe will be crying.
This is the only silver lining of a Sanders nomination. We either get to see the Trump scum meltdown or the Bernie bros meltdown. Win-win.
Saaaaame.
Behavior of the following represents the behavior of the leader. Biden voters are good people cause Biden is. What does that say about Bernie?
Voting for a president is more than voting for a set of policies. Its voting for a leader and for the tone that politics will have for the next four years.  There is more to a vision for america than what policies are put forth, you can agree on a lot of policies and still disagree on the person who should implement those policies.  America needs a Uniter, not a second divider.
In a better world, that would be the case, but we've had 4 years of someone who surrounds himself with terrible people and supporters, and people are naturally wary of any candidate with a similar problem.  I personally think a lot of the problem stemmed from interfering trolls, but much like those who follow Trump, there's a lot of people who care only for their "team" and now that they're convinced of what is the truth, they'll follow to the end.  It's less about "being mean" and more about concerning and potentially dangerous hostility.
Sorry how supporters behave is also a part. Ber ie bros are out right insulting. When biden won SC..their counter point was he won in a dumb state that will be red in nov anyway. While no one is discounting SC is a red state insulting the dem voters from that state is not right.  I also believe they wud have sung a different tune if bernie qud have in SC.  I like bernies policy (some of them) but cant vote for a guy where his supporters tell me my vote does xount because i live in a red state. And that establiment gun voting senator isnt even a fucking dem.
I've already seen the images comparing tweets from before and after from the same supporter, but reading that one... I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

The way of the Mandalarkeyan?
Were you sleeping for the past few months?
Can we take a moment to appreciate that this sub’s population has doubled in 48 hours?
This is what happens when a campaign practices a politics of belonging and inclusion.  Other campaigns saw Joe as a competitor on the same team, not an enemy, and vice versa.   so here we are!
Yesterday a new coalition was born.  Like the Fellowship we must support each other for the greater good.
Not quite doubled, we've had about about 1200 subscribers in the last 48 hours. Still amazing.   Thank you to the new mods joining us, and everyone else helping to keep the sub positive and troll free.
Pete supporter seeking refuge here. Hope this new home serves me well.
I was here before it was cool, like 4 days ago
I needed my daily campaign news fix now that my candidate is out and now that r/politics is unusable. Also fun to be back in a sub that has momentum. But we gotta boost these numbers a bit. These are rookie numbers.
Biden is assembling the infinity gauntlet to banish malarkey
Pete supporter here glad to be on board! Came upon this sub yesterday, and it's been a great pick-me-up! Never thought I'd have so much positive energy so quickly after the campaign suspension
Holy fuck. That's some serious growth. Get 'em Joe!
Team Pete (for Biden) reporting in!  I'm *mostly* over my sadness, and am ready to Win the Era with Joe.
This is only a microcosm of what is happening right now all over the US
Team Pete reporting for duty.
And we'll keep growing!
I came here yesterday because I saw there was a thread about Pete. It made me feel welcome, like I was respected and that the Joe supporters wanted us to stay Pete supporters and not just switch over. It became a Joe/Amy/Pete team rather than a "convert to Joe or leave" type thing which is much closer to what I found on Bernie subs. Glad to be here. I will proudly wear my Pete 2020 shirt today and cast my vote for Joe Biden.
We're heeeeeerrrrrrrrre!
In far off France I heard your call  And here am I to give my all
Why is there no Yang flair? Yang Gang movement is what Biden needs to counteract some of the Berners.
Subscribed yesterday. I voted early for Warren in NC, but Pete was my second choice. Now that second choice is Biden, and political realities being what they are, he's now the guy I'm hoping gets the nomination.
This sub isn’t just surging because of Pete, Amy, and Beto’s individual endorsements; it’s surging because people feel they can belong here in a way they may not feel with other candidates. Supporters embody the underlying theme of their candidate’s campaign, and Joe Biden’s campaign is all about DECENCY. So keep on being decent, welcome to all our new partners, and let’s restore America’s soul.
Thank you for the warm welcome. It’s so refreshing to see so many people rise above the sports fanatic nature of supporting a candidate and come together and accomplish goals we all share.  The republicans didn’t figure that out in 2016, we may have narrowly avoided the same mistake
The Amy Army division is in the house!
👋👋👋   Coalition time, baby!   -pete fam
As a Pete supporter, thanks for the warm welcome! It feels good to find another inclusive community that is also kind, progressive, and joyful.  It makes it easier to just leave the hate alone today. And while I'm still torn between Warren and Joe, I've already caucused for Pete, so I'm just happy that there's a home for us (and that Pete gets to continue his mission to serve and WIN).

I thought it felt more energetic in here!  WELCOME TO ALL OUR NEW SUPPORTERS!!!
I was torn between Mayor Pete and Bernie for the election. I don’t vote until April 28 so I’m gonna think until then about bernie or Biden now but I joined just to see the vibe here. Kinda like it, enjoying the malarkey being thrown around and I really liked Biden, Pete and Beto last night speaking seems like Uncle Joe has his groove back.      I’m gonna be following both subs but I’m a proper democrat and will be donating and voting for whoever is our nominee
Most of Pete's supporters are coming your way. I've retired my Pete gear  and I just pre-bought the Biden, Beto, Amy, Pete shirt and donated to the campaign.   We are at the end game. Expect the #ROTR gang to have your back.
It's because you guys showed the proper way to both treat your opponents during the primary, and how to welcome them into your movement afterwards!
Newb here! Hi
I shall ride with Joseph.
I didnt even know this sub existed until this morning when someone mentioned it in the comments on ESS...thank you to whomever you were! I'm here 😊 sorry I was late
Yeah if he really does pull off a huge comeback here, you guys are gonna have to start explaining a few things, like....what the hell is "Diamond Joe"?
I am Team Pete from day 1, but I'm so ready to bring all the same energy to helping Joe get elected.   Win the era, stop the malarkey! <3
Love this sub but r/neoliberal is the true Biden stan sub
I don’t know where I’ve been. On Reddit for 2 years, a Biden fan since 2007!
Bernie voter here - subbed to all current candidates.
I came here after Kamala dropped out. I knew Joe was the only one left to take on Trump
PM me pics of Joe's pearly whites
Kamala supporter here now RidinWithBiden
I’ve bounced from pages for Hickenlooper to Bloomberg to here   Nice to have a home :)

You mean a campaign message of "If you're not with us you can fuck right off" isn't a viable strategy?
100% this.  Couldn’t have said it any better!
You have my sword
You have my vote.
I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick Trump's (and Bernie's) ass.  And I'm all out of bubblegum.
You have my axe
That's the 2nd LOTR reference I've seen today. Us Pete2Joe textbankers we're blessed with someone comparing us to the Elves coming in a the Battle of Helms Deep. As a LOTR geek, it gave me life!
Thanks for being so welcoming and hopefully we don't track a bunch of mud over the carpets. It's hard having a bunch of new people you don't necessarily know invade your house for a party, but so far it seems like there's cohesion!
We were in the Mid 3ks just a few days ago
I seem to remember thinking that his couldn't be Joe's sub because there were only ~3,000 people in it...now it's ~6,500.
Same here! It’s sad, but I’m proud of Pete for practicing what he preached and I’m hopeful about this new coalition that puts human decency and belonging over ideological purity and a politics of exclusion.
Fellow refugee here. Still hurting really badly, but I think this is the best place to be now.
I seem to be in the same boat. I was crushed when Pete dropped out, walked into my polling place this morning intending to vote for Warren, but when push came to shove I decided we need to unify above anything else and voted for Biden. So here's hoping this is the start of a beautiful coalition!
Fellow refugee here, too! Hopefully this sub also accepts how extra we are😉.
seeing a lot of faces from /r/Pete_Buttigieg :)
Same, but I’m looking forward to Secretary of State Buttigieg?
I’ve been here for a few weeks.
It's astonishing how bad that sub has become. I found this one in the past two days and one of the 1,200 newbies.  The only good thing is you ALSO have more people more vocally speaking out on that sub now as well, downvotes be damned
It’s infested with Bernie babies
I still maintain that r/politics is salvageable if enough non-Bernie people start using it, especially the new feed.
Ah yes. r/politics, the biggest Bernie sub.  I think we all can't wait when they eventually meltdown when Bernie doesn't get the nominee lol.
Somebody needs to make this gif. I've already got one planned to make tonight should we do well today.
I'm casting Sanders as Loki.  Villain for the first movie, but will be reconciled in the sequel against the truly existential threat.

I'm new here too but looks like you can customize your own.  But yeah ... def should have a default one for Yang Gang. Ya'll are a force.
If elections are about building coalitions - and so, that matter, is governing - then Pete is doing pretty great.
If my beloved Cory joins (and gets added to the shirt), I'll buy.  I'd buy for Pete's name but, well, I already have three Pete shirts.
there's a \*what\* shirt  ....excuse me i have to go somewhere right now immediately
I'd love a meme explainer. Like is that a gator emoji in the post titles?  I believe Diamond Joe is a reference to the way The Onion has portrayed him the last few years. Like a divorced, domestic beer drinking uncle at a family reunion with ridiculous stories about his old days.
I respect wanting to have a full understanding of Biden's policy, but you should be able to find policy articles on your own. You can't expect his namesake sub not to be full of campaign hyping content now that he's the moderate front-runner. It's a good thing that they're coalescing around him. If this didn't eventually happen, he could never be President.
Bernie not doing more to try to reign in those types of supporters (some of which are his own paid staff ) is undermining his ability to pick up voters from campaigns that have been suspended.  I honestly didn't think Bernie Bros was a thing in 2016... but after a couple of months of rats and snakes on twitter and how obnoxious his supporters were to the Culinary Union in Nevada?  Yeah, no.   I'm for expanding Obamacare to have a true public option and I think at some point we'll get to a place closer to Medicare for All.  But I can take a big pass on much of the rest of that platform.
Love your user name! My condolences on your death in the Bowling Green Massacre.
apparently not!   I tried to warn them, but they didn't listen.
"But we are inclusive"  They are a mixed up bunch.
yeah.. Bernie bro toxicity is 100% why i won't be supporting him. And I know it's not Russian Trolls b/c it's people i know IRL on facebook trolling anything I posted supportive of Pete. Diamond Joe all the way!
There's such a failure of emotional intelligence at play here. It'd be one thing if it was just a matter of "don't be an ass, because that's the moral thing to do." But they've charged right past that into "don't be an ass, because it keeps you from getting what you want."  Like, buddies, pals, friends...........you're not hurting \*me\*, you're hurting \*you\*. C'mon, man...basic social skills are an important life skill to pick up.
Thanks. I needed a laugh this morning.

I offer my bow to VP Biden on this day.

The time of the liberals is over, my people are leaving this country. Who will you look to when we've gone? The Lolbertarians? They hide in their bunkers hoarding anime they care nothing for the troubles of others.  It is in Democrats that we must place our hope.  Democrats? Democrats are weak. The Democratic Party is failing. The Obama coalition is all but spent, the Party's dignity is forgotten. It is because of the failure of Democrats that populism survived... There is no strength left in the Democratic Party. They're scattered and divided, leaderless.  [There is one who could unite them.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Joe_Biden_%2848554137807%29_%28cropped%29.jpg) One who could reclaim the Democratic nomination.  [He turned from that path a long time ago.](https://i.imgur.com/KnFZZDl.png)
I plan on being a good guest. I brought wine from the cave, and I'll make my bed in the mornings.
So extra 🙌🏼
I really wish Pete would run for senate or governor in Indiana.
Malarkey!
Your username is lovely.
I was new to Reddit by the time Trump was President so while it was clear the sub was a safe haven for liberals (which was fine I guess but I would prefer a more even level of discourse for all ideologies), I never could have imagined that a sub of such generality...politics...could very obviously swing to one candidate. Little did I know it was like that in 2016 too. I use the Reddit mobile app and it has its own section to sort by politics (which pulls in posts from the biggies like politics, world news, news, etc.). But that just means a portion of the app is now functionally unusable for me until hopefully it reverts back to it’s status pre-primaries.
Like Muppet Babies, but less wholesome.
Let's not take joy in other people's pain.  Just like Joe (and this sub) was able to welcome supporters from other campaigns into the fold, we ultimately need to be prepared to welcome in Bernie refugees as well if we want them to vote with us come November.     This is why the Rules of the Road is so important.
I'm not very excited for that. 14% of Bernie primary voters went and voted for Trump in 2016.  The number of Bernie primary voters that flipped to Trump was larger than Trump's margin of victory in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.  Long story short, if these people literally just stayed home, much less voted for Hillary, Donald Trump is not your President.  If Joe wins, it cannot be about thumbing our noses at the other side. It's about telling them that we ALL believe in Democratic Socialism. We all believe in expanded healthcare, in better wages, lower tuition etc.  There's so much more that unites us than divides us.
There's been a good amount of gifs at /r/enough_sanders_spam
hilariously you named the exact reason I haven't bought it yet, I'm kind of looking at it like "I'm going to buy this shirt and tomorrow Warren or whoever is going to decide to join the Biden campaign, I just know it..."
I gotta admit, it's a pretty cool shirt!
from what I was told, the gator is an ironic usage because they "defend the Swamp"
Not only is he not reigning them in, his campaign rhetoric actively encourages them.  He explicitly and implicitly calls opponents corrupt stooges of corporations who won't fight for working people.  Then members of his campaign imply that anyone who doesn't agree with his health plan are murderers.  Then they act surprised when his supporters viciously attack his opponents for being corrupt lying murderers.  Edit:forgot some words
I haven't seen a thread on it personally (thank god) but the folks at the Pete subreddit said Pete & Chasten's phone number got doxed yesterday, too. Fucking assholes are really testing my Rules of the Road civility right now.
You said it. I too came from Pete to Joe. If there was a thought about Bernie (and early on there was), his campaign and follower's behavior destroyed it for me. Joe is inclusive and positive, and his agenda and ability to get it done seem far more realistic than Bernie's.
CNN has projected that Joe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Florida!
The talking point is now "Well, Florida is a red state, so who cares".  It went for Obama twice!  Imagine Obama back on the campaign trail for Joe! it will be awesome
CNN allots 59 delegates to Biden, only 12 for Sanders as of now
It looks like a clean sweep for Biden.  Bernie needs to give it up already.
Shoot it straight into my veins.
Can Bernie drop out? It’s a serious public health hazard at this point.
At Sander's HQ, "Dang it! we should have praised Castro more!"
This was the big one.  Had Sanders somehow scored big or won this because of coronavirus, we'd be in this for the long haul.  I think Sanders concedes after today.  It made some sense to keep going after the debate.  No it's over.
ICE CREAM FOR ALL
We're all Riden with Biden.  Sanders supporters can get on board or support Trump, or not vote, but the democratic candidate is in the books.
We ARE BIDEN COUNTRY! BIDEN 2020 💪💪
What..i thought old and uneducated viters dont vote....
Every single county so far.
Live county-by-county [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/us/elections/results-florida-president-democrat-primary-election.html?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=Navigation).  I love Sumter county (West of Orlando), where Bernie is losing to Bloomberg, who dropped out weeks ago.
>In 2016, Sanders lost Florida to Hillary Clinton. Some groups Sanders performed well with in 2016, such as white men and independents, didn’t follow him in 2020. In 2016, 52% of white men supported Sanders for the nomination while only a quarter did so in 2020 -- slightly more than 6 in 10 voting for Biden.  >In 2020, half of independent Democratic voters in Florida supported Biden for the nomination. That's a flip from 2016, when 55% of voters in the state backed Sanders
Don't praise Fidel Castro next time
LETS FUCKING JOOOEEEE!!!
Moved to Florida in 2018 and but my vote was still in Georgia that election (voted for Abrams) - so this was my first vote as a Floridian and proud to say that I voted for Joe.  Went in early voting on Sunday.
He's winning every county in the state with over 50% in each one.  \#berniedropout
Welcome, if expected, news!
Another major swing state for the general that Biden had easily won.
Excellent, good job on Joe and his outreach.  It's especially needed right now, we have to unify the democratic party and fast if we want to beat Trump.     Now I voted for Sanders, and was banned for /r/sandersforpresident for asking them to tone down there attacks, and now I am all in for Joe.  I want him to win and I want to help show people that his policies and Sanders aren't too far off (not just status quo).  There are going to be a lot of people who want to drag their feet in the mud or name call or complain.  Don't be one of those people.  Be open, be willing to show a better way.  Be ready to unify the democratic party.     WE are here to unite, we have to bring leadership back to Washington and help ensure supreme court seats aren't lost.  Biden is going to help us get there, and I hope other former-Sanders supporters can hop aboard soon.
Joe can't be stopped. Next is Trump
Yo Joe!!
Proud of my state. Let’s go Joe!
Is Florida joining the Every County Gang?
Now this is what I wanna see hit the front page
#JOEMENTUM
Go Joe!
At what point does Bernie go from being the runner-up to just an asshole that wants to cause problems?
Heyyyy I voted for joe first day of early voting in Jacksonville
I called my grandma, and through tears, begged her not to volunteer for this primary, and she insisted (as a life long democrat).  We kicked Bernie's ass.  I hope it was worth it.  At this point, extending the primary is blood on his hands
☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Yeah but who is Rosario Dawson or Beto's former band mate endorsing? /s
Let's go Joe!!🙌🏼😎💎
Keep bringing people in -- invite people to this subreddit!!
This is about as surprisint as "Sanders wins Vermont", except for Biden it's like a dozen or more states with several times as many delegates each.
The gators pull through!
Is that the same graphic they use during the NFL draft?
Is Florida winner take all?
Keep inviting people to join this subreddit!!  We need much more than 11.5K members!!
Biden Gabbard 2020
What are the reasons for people supporting Joe over Bernie? I assumed before this election that everyone would obviously be for Bernie or Sanders but it looks like I've been living in a bubble. I myself can't see a reason but it seems like it's not gonna happen  for Bernie and Id love to have a reason to vote for him that's not he's better than Trump.
I’m on the fence here, why do you guys want Biden so badly?
Canada, and the rest of the world, watches as people vote for a person who is not going to hold up on their platform promises.   People actually forget that politicians will lie to get into office? And when they succeed, the backpedaling becomes impossible to ignore?  I love humans but I swear America is some grandiose social experiment in ignorance, propaganda, and greed.  I really hope actual progressives in America refuse to vote when it comes to the presidential election. Some lessons can only be learned the hard way. Enjoy your next half of decade, choosing between lying garbage and lying garbage.
Ugh. Americans never learn. Maybe it’s our terrible educational system or our uniquely poor healthcare system or our unfathomable protections for the rich despite having inflating prisoner, homeless and injustice rates. True leaders come to light but are trampled by weak citizens that are hedging their bets on a future that returns to the same old routine instead of continuing to deal with untrustworthy and embarrassing leadership. Americans deserve what they get. They deserve all of this. Bernie was change. He was two steps forward while Biden is one step back. Granted, Trump is twenty steps backwards, but overall it’s not progress. It’s starting to feel like a deadly virus that attacks mostly older generations is a bit like karma.
Great.... 8 more years NO universal healthcare
Just another moderate to get us nowhere. I'll vote for him, but I'm voting for 8 years of mediocrity.
Illinois went to Biden, and that's a solid blue state. Michigan went to Biden, and it's a blue-leaning swing state. There really is no argument.  My only regrets are to not be able to vote for Biden today :( my governor pulled the plug last minute and I didn't early vote because I was still a little unsure about Biden or Bernie until the request for a ballot window closed.
Biden winning texas and Florida basically means Bernie should drop out. Those are the 2 most important states. And didn't biden win Michigan too?  I love Bernie's message, but he has to get his head on right and quit.
CNN is projecting an insurmountable lead for Biden as Sanders' gains are wiped away in Florida
Why would he do that? He can still take donations from hourly employees that are currently out of work. It’s all a very kind and considerate approach.
>It looks like a clean sweep for Biden.  It will be a clean sweep for Biden!
If BS drops out, the rest of the states can move their primaries to June and do them by mail.
"Clean sweep" is right, I wouldn't be surprised if he keeps winning every state going forward.
Say what you want about Bernie, but he isn't a quitter. He's in it until the convention. He has millions of vociferous supporters and owes it to them to not sell out.
Seriously, forcing people to keep going to the polls for an obviously lost cause is just irresponsible at this point.
Not to mention the chaos and uncertainty, with states postponing primaries, combined with the virus, means the rest of the primary might not have as good turnout, which could skew the results.
He’s just announced he won’t speak at all tonight what an asshole. Just drop out!
We probably shouldn’t vote in November either
Man you have more optimism than me, feels like he has no intention of stopping.
Maybe.  Who knows with this guy Though. What was it.. 6 weeks after the convention he endorsed Clinton
No way he concedes. No way.
Reading your comment instantly made me think of the James Franco meme.   First time?
[removed]
There’s no such thing as an “independent” democratic voter. You have to be “Democrat” to vote in Florida’s primary.
Not a surprise, to be sure, and a welcome one.  R/unexpectedpalpatine
I hope we can avoid using derogatory language to describe Sanders. Sanders is intense and very passionate about his beliefs, which often manifests itself in misguided ways, which definitely causes problems, but I don’t think that makes him an asshole.
She's 83 years old and served as a moderate Democrat in the Missouri house of representatives for 16 years.
No. Democratic primaries are more or less proportional.
Bruh
Bernie talks a lot of big game but a lot of what he says is really unrealistic.  I trust candidates like Joe and Warren who actually know what they're doing in politics.  While I have very progressive views, I also don't think Bernie can win a general election.  A lot of what I'm thinking is very practical, based on polls, results, and knowledge of how governments and campaigns are run.  I think Joe is the second best candidate who was running for president, after Warren, since he knows what he's doing and is much more liberal than people think.
Bernie is hugely idealistic but a lot of what he hopes to accomplish just isn’t politically or realistically feasible right now. I know that Joe isn’t perfect, but he’s pragmatic with lots of political experience, and I think he can get a lot done if we give him a chance.
I think that while Sanders is very passionate and idealistic, Biden wants many of the same things but is more pragmatic and realistic, understanding that a lot of what Sanders wants is just not politically or economically feasible right now—but hopefully Joe can get things like a public option or higher minimum wage so that we’re at least on the way there.
How in the world can reasonable person hope that America votes in Donald Trump again? This election affects countries outside of the US too, you know. Insane.
You're part of the problem, unfortunately. We'd love to have you join us. If you feel like this progress isn't progressive enough just please remember progress is progress. Joe will do so much right, so much more than the current administration.
I think Bernie has great ideas, dreams and passion, but unfortunately Bernie is not pragmatic enough to turn them into reality. I think that even if Bernie was elected president, he would not be able to accomplish even 1% of what he’s campaigning on but his supporters don’t realize this.   I definitely don’t think Joe is perfect, but I think he’s on a bus that’s going to the same place as Sanders, just slower but with a higher chance of making progress there.  I hope that if nothing else, you can come to agree that taking one step back is still much better than twenty.
Universal probably next time we get a trifecta. Single payer madness with no out of pocket expenses and outlawing private insurance?    Youll be waiting a lot longer than 8 years on that one. Ill vote against it forever.
Did you really think Bernie was going to come in and get you universal healthcare right away? Even if he somehow got it passed through Congress, it would take years to implement. Years.
Joe hinted last year that he's only staying for one term. Maybe it's a good time to start building bridges instead of burning them (not pointing to you specifically).
*Probably 4
I think you’re on the wrong sub
Ok
Cool story.
Thats OK my friend, glad to have you on board for the general election!
Make sure to vote before June 2 then! Your vote still counts up and down the ballot!
Michigan was a huge win for Biden. That showed he is the best candidate to win the Midwest in the general election
Seriously. And encouraging a drawn out primary at this point is very dangerous. He has zero chance. Get off your ideological high horse and drop out.  Again, coming from a former Bernie supporter
Biden is adopting alot of Bernie's policies. He even has moderate versions of what Bernie wants. Which is why part of the reason Biden is getting so popular.
Yeah I can't believe he doesn't have his head on right. If only he was some back-pedalling piece of garbage who has no problem lying his way into office. I'm up here in Canada and I pity all the people who think someone like Joe Biden is going to hold up any of his platform promises. It literally just happened here in Alberta, Canada. A conservative was voted in and immediately just went against his promises for profit. Have a clue. Joe Biden isn't gonna help you.
He can also still kill thousands of his opponent's supporters by feigning an ongoing primary fight, forcing septuagenarian Biden voters to literally risk their lives to go to the polls and vote for someone who has already mathematically won.
People who say Bernie has had no effect on wealth inequality are dead wrong.  He has managed to transfer considerable money from vulnerable millennial to media conglomerates and social media giants
Not sure he will win a district all day.
Result declared after merely an hour!? This election must be rigged. /s
At what cost?  People are needlessly standing in line for the primaries when there is no need.
Tbf there’s more on ballots than just the primary, though I agree he needs to drop out
It's becoming super clear that this is an ego thing for him. Same exact "strategy" as 2016 that dampened enthusiasm and turnout for the actual Democratic nominee when he knew he had 0% chance. So irresponsible.
Iirc he endorsed her right before the convention
This year is totally different though. Clinton and DWS actually did a bunch of shady shit that people had a right to be mad about in 16. This year the primary was naked and fair and objective and Sanders has not a damn thing to complain about. He lost because voters don't want his ideas. Full stop.
There is a core group of Sanders supporters who are committed to poisoning the political discourse no matter what.  No need to teabag them.
But is it like Kansas where you can change your party affiliation up to the day of?
This community was incredibly welcoming and kind after Pete dropped out. I'm happy and proud to be joining the Biden team!
Honestly what turned me from Pete to Joe the most was just how graceful Joe and all of his supporters were to people (like me) that supported good ol bootyjudge. I’m sad that Pete is out of the race but I’m really excited to be rooting for Joe
Pete was the first presidential candidate that I've donated to. Joe will be the second. I feel very confident in saying Pete will likely be the third.
Yep, I felt the same way after Beto dropped out. They don't ask you to assimilate and stop loving your first choice candidate. They recognize it's going to take all of us together to get it done.
i’m also a pete-turned-biden supporter! i mentioned my views on r/lgbt and the bernie supporters didn’t take to kindly to it, lol
I'm for Joe because Pete is for Joe, but hearing him say "Team Pete, Team Amy, Team Beto, this is your win too" really means a lot. I feel welcome here.
I was team Pete.  I cast my MA Super Tuesday ballot for 💎 Joe and was so excited to see the big upset win in my home state
*Raises wine glass*
Welcome!
That is a badass graphic! Wish there was one for "Yang gang for Joe"
I think I still have a Pete 2020 shirt on the way, and I'm going to try to find a Biden pin to wear with it. Pete is still my main candidate, and I trust he knows best, and if he endorses Biden, I support him too
I love that there are default flair options for supporters of all the other candidates. That is a sweet way to welcome us in and allow us to be part of Team Biden without having to give up our earlier teams. Although I might have to steal that Win the Era, End the Malarkey one I’ve seen a couple people using...
Welcome to have you! Pete will do great things alongside Joe.
Happy to 🐝here🤠
I resemble this comment. Team Pete for Joe
I really hope Pete becomes Joe’s running mate. Pete has the Midwest vote, the white vote, and can bring youth and substantive policy to Joe’s campaign.
I decided to follow your lead and create a [twitter header](https://imgur.com/2G6Lzj6) from yours!
That's a feel-good graphic if I've ever seen one. ❤️
Also a Pete supporter here who has always liked Uncle Joe. I'm kinda butthurt about the campaign ad but if Pete was willing to forgive and forget...
Another Pete to Joe guy here!   Joe 2020 - Pete 2024
I honestly think that if Trump were not president a lot of people would still be in the race and things would be different but with a supreme court justice likely up, and the census, people just want the win! that being said the VP has to be a woman!
The r/JoeBiden community REALLY needs to give proper credit to Pete Buttigieg and Pete4American for adopting their Rules of the Road.  Now.  I sent a message to the original poster, but haven't heard from them.   See "Rules of the Road" among the "Connect" links:
I'M READY TO TAKE DOWN THE LEVEL OF MALARKEY IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT TO MORE MANAGEABLE LEVELS
Here's some backgrounds for others who made the switch like us:   [Beto for Joe](https://imgur.com/a/4GFVuDK)  [Yang Gang for Joe](https://imgur.com/a/SXtGEMY)  [Amy for Joe](https://imgur.com/a/z1ikBou)
>rooting for Joe  I believe the proper nomenclature is "ridin' with Biden".
Right there with ya :)
Same here! Also Pete was my first vote, and Joe will (hopefully) be my second
Agree completely. This is an inclusive movement that doesn’t try and force you into it’s ideal mold. Sad Pete dropped out, but I’ve found a new home I’m proud of. This is a diverse coalition of Americans and I love it.
Pete Buttigieg supporter here!  Beto would also be great as part of a Biden Administration.   Pete, Beto, Amy, Kamala, Corey Booker, Julian, Yang, Steyer, Stacie Abrams, Rep. Val Demings, and Walter Clyburn Reed, even Bloomberg, could bring a broad, diverse range of experiences and talents to a Biden Administration!  And I like Warren and Sanders staying in the Senate, as they rep states with Repub Governors, and helping champion Democratic legislation.  Oh, and Adam Schiff too! ;-)   #TeamDemocrats
Bernie supporters don’t take kindly to anything that remotely opposes bernie
I'm gay but I had to leave r/LGBT. Ironically, it's one of the most intolerant subs I've come across. Team Joe!
Bernie supporters have pretty much brigaded every subreddit that's not explicitly for another presidential candidate and r/neoliberal. You can't go on Reddit without running in to a Bernie supporter at this point.
Team Pete knows design... I hope Biden hires them all!
I would love to see Yang for, Amy for, Beto for, etc shirts like this!
Thank you! I made it myself. I'm slowly learning design. Let me see if I can make a Yang one for you!  [Here's my best shot.](https://imgur.com/a/SXtGEMY)
Lol, I did the exact same thing with all my Beto shirts. I've seen a lot of friends in Beto shirts with Biden pins.
I love it!
I gave up malarkey for Lent.
If there was a Pete one that’d be perfect!
I think the fewer sitting senators and reps pulled from congress the better though quite honestly
They’re full of MALARKEY
i’m definitely considering, r/lgbteens is much more inclusive and caters to me more anyway
Hey, the [top post](https://np.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fdi31p/holy_fuck_you_morons_are_proud_to_be_neolibs/) on /r/neoliberal this week is a Bernie troll that everyone ran with, haha.

Oh right lol I totally forgot what the post was initially. Thanks!
@JoeBiden has served our country with dignity and we need him now more than ever. I will do everything in my power to help elect him the next President of the United States.
Man this endorsement took a while. It was obvious she was waiting til Warren dropped out though. She and Warren are very very close.  Edit: Proof  > NEW: Harris and Biden spoke yesterday. She had been giving Warren space and decided to move forward with endorsing the former VP after Warren got out of the race, a Harris aide tells me.  https://twitter.com/deepa_shivaram/status/1236637325695877126
It's good to finally have Kamala's official endorsement. Now we wait and see if she'll be the future VP. Admittedly I'm biased because she was one of first choices in the primary but out of all the picks Joe can make I think she fits the criteria Joe needs the most.  1. Younger than him to reassure voters who are concerned about Joe pushing 80, but not so young and greenhorn as to be a potential liability if (knock on wood) the worst happens. She's been in the government game for a while, if she needs to she can hit the ground running as a President. 2. Is an African-American woman with tons of experience towards reaching out and firing up the Black Woman demographic that will be key to winning 2020. 3. As an addendum to the above, choosing an African-American running mate to ensure the black vote that Joe will not take them for granted will be one of the biggest keys to 2020. Just relying on having good numbers with black voters isn't gonna cut it as Hillary unfortunately proved in 2016. 4. A good puncher in debates and can confidently hand Mike Pence his ass.  The biggest problem with Kamala as VP is that she doesn't add too much to the delegate table given she's from California, but that also means that the Dems can very safely have her leave her Senate seat without fear of giving it up to the Republicans. Overall seems like the most logical choice to me.
40 current and former Senators have endorsed Joe.  THREE have endorsed Sanders
fucking r/politics is trash. There are like 10 different posts about jesse jackson endorsing bernie but almost no post about kamala.  &#x200B;  My post got deleted instantly
Is this campaign number 9 or 10 to unite?   We need Cory Booker
I had to scroll down about 5 pages on the Politics sub to find this. You can tell it's great news by how hard they're trying to bury it.
Kamala supporter here. You have acquired an army.
Joe Biden ALL THE WAY!
[removed]
I was just minutes ago speculating it is more likely Warren will endorse than Harris and it will come tomorrow.  Well shit, it shows how much I know.  lol
https://medium.com/@KamalaHarris/im-endorsing-joe-biden-for-president-of-the-united-states-46f30079295d  Her full statement
K-A-M-A-L-A!!!!!  So excited to see her back out on the campaign. And she did it before AZ so that means there's a chance I'll get to see her campaigning for Joe here!!!
If Warren endorses, I hope Castro joins. I know it’s not sexy, but I’m rooting for him or Beto for VP to help with the Latino vote. Joes struggling with that bloc and far too many voted Trump in ‘16.   It may also make AZ a true battleground now
Welcome aboard!
Beat me by half a second lol
Then she needs to move to WA for the next three days.
Thank You, United States Attorney General Kamala Harris  I love Kamala, but I don't think she's the right choice for VP. Yes, she might fuel young voters, but the fact remains that she comes from a Blue state.  What Biden needs now is someone who will deliver a swing state. And I'm not even sure if Stacey Abrams can equally deliver.
Add it to the t-shirt...
I'm sure there would be a great reporter out there (Sam Stein, eugene Robinson ?) Who would cover this Politics sub take over and suppression of average headlines   Last I checked it was around one in 30 stories featuring Biden news. They were acting like Bernie dominates 50 percent coverage and the rest is corona virus
My girl!!! Yes!
There are literally a dozen posts on politics about Jesse Jackson endorsing Sanders. His supporters are just so happy Bernie finally has a black friend.

This is beautiful. My Biden-Harris ticket dream lives!
A bit surprising, considering how many K-Hives moved to Joe when Harris dropped out. Prominent Harris supporters and surrogates have been attacking Warren for months.
If it’s not Pete then I hope it’s Kamala and if it’s not Kamala, I hope it’s Pete.
My thoughts are similar. She really does check a lot of boxes for the ticket. If she was somehow a rep from Ohio it would have be a no-brainer for the reasons you mentioned. The ticket as a whole is easy to imagine and seems possible now.
We really don’t need #2 though as evidenced by turnout. We are much more desperate for Latino turnout.   I believe nearly 30% went for Trump compared to like 8% of African Americans
re 4. She would eat his face. Man that's a debate I want to see.
I bought an Amy, Kamala, and Pete shirt last fall. It was meant to be. PS— why is all the Biden stuff preorder and taking forever? Edit: Kamala would add gender balance and bring in the south and lower- Midwest, big time.
Do you guys think the bussing thing during the first debate will be a problem down the line ? Can it be used by republicans to sow discord in the ticket ?
I completely disagree about Kamala helping Biden. Being black and from California I don’t think does enough to help Biden. Joe is obviously going to take California in the general election and he’s already doing well with black voters. Also Kamala didn’t do well in the debates her performance got worse over time
Wait who are the three? I only know of Lehy
Hillary said it best.

R/politics is another Bernie sub, those guys will downvote you if you like anyone other than Bernie
The Brothers Bernard virus has claimed another sub.    And the vaccine is still months away.
The Jesse that matters? Jesse White, Illinois’ Secretary of State for forever, who endorsed Joe. He’s the only Democrat my parents would vote for before the Trump era.
Ugh, you’re right, r/politics only has posts praising Bernie.
Someone posted Kamala's endorsement 5 hours ago, but it's burried with less than 700 upvotes.
Yikes, you weren’t kidding. Not a single post about Kamala. But like ten about Jackson at the very top.
I'm noticing that as well..plus I'm seeing a lot of trash sources on there lately.
[removed]
You posted an article someone already had posted.
I think Booker would add a lot. He and Joe have a very folksy style and connect really well with voters. As far as a net positive in the style/marketability this ticket is a winner.
Booker was my #2. Man, I wish he had made it a lot further. It always mystified me why he didn't have more support.
They're most likely upvoting the fact that Jesse Jackson endorsed Bernie. They act like a guy who hasn't run in 32 years will impact the election. I mean I like Jesse Jackson but I'm not stupid enough to think he'll impact Bernie in Michigan.
r/politics is such a misleading name because the people going there think they are getting "fair and balanced" news.....   its the kind of troll forum that got Trump elected
HEAR, HEAR!
And hopefully WE have acquired a VP or attorneys general, or Supreme Court justice or whatever the heck she wants to do 😎🍦
Even if its only 1.7% of the Dem voter base we'll take it!

I liked Castro. I was supporting him for president from February 2019 until he made this ridiculous attack on Biden. I still can’t quite help liking him though. If he would just apologize, that would be great.
Beto isn't a latino........
While I love Stacey, I don’t know if she has enough national name recognition for VP, she definitely deserves a cabinet position. It would be amazing to have her in charge of a federal voting rights commission that wasn’t a sham like this administration tried with investigating “voter fraud.”
Kamala for AG!
I like klobacher. I think she could help in the northern Midwest including Wisconsin,the hardest must win state for Biden. Harris would be a great VP but I think it's a stronger ticket in the EC with klobacher. And I don't look forests to Harris having to explain why we should support someone she called a segregationist racist.
She turned down Obama's offer to be AG.
Could Pete deliver Indiana? Or is that still a long shot?
I think a lot of the conventional wisdom right now is basically saying we lost 2016 because of lower black turnout in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. There's hope someone who connects to that community well like Abrams or Harris might be the way to bring that turnout back up closer to Obama levels, and if we can do that we'll carry all three states.
[removed]
Who are you thinking? Andrew Gillum?
Yea. Did you see the r-politics sub on Super Tuesday?  Front page posts about Bernie leading and winning states.... while Biden whooped his ass with more than double of the number of Bernie's state wins.  If you didn't get out of the sub, you didn't know that Biden was the decisive victor lol.
What is it about her that you like?

It's sad when even this subreddit falls to the lies of Bernie Sanders supporters.
Joe is building a coalition, it's a big tent.
I love how circular your preferences are :P
I definitely think the only possibilities for me are Catherine Cortez Masto, Stacey Abrams, and Amy Klobuchar. All help secure valuable constituencies for the Democratic party and help us electorally. Pete Buttigieg should run for Senate in 2022 in Indiana. Kamala's unfair takedown of Biden wasn't cool and her actions as D.A. weren't good as compared to Biden's record as a public defender.
Surprise pick of AOC.  /s
That's the Cubans and Puerto Ricans. Lots of them are long term R's   Even with how Trump handled Maria aftermath, the R's on the Puerto Rican side of my family are still for him.
Eh I doubt it tbh, actually it will fit in well with his theme.  "The fact that Kamala and I can get along after she bruised me in the debate in Miami, is indicative of the work I am doing of bringing this country together. Folks, we're so bitterly divided as a nation that we oftentimes seek to see what divides us more than what separates us. I've proven to build diverse coalitions and can worth with folks from every isle"   We need all the help we can get to combat Malarky
Pretty sure Biden was outdoing her with the AA vote when she was still in. Her and Booker both.
Mike Gravel and Don Riegle  Also at least 80 current House members, compared to eight for Bernie, four of which are TeH sQuAd
at some point the Sanders movement will look around and realize that in order to achieve some of their goals (which are admittedly noble if impractical ideas), they will need at least some strong allies within the "establishment" to accomplish them.   Being in Congress for over 30 years, by the way, makes one part of the establishment. He's only been in this long because he represents a small state with an independent streak. And that's fine, the people of Vermont have chosen him time and again to represent them. But Sanders would never have been elected statewide in New York.  Maybe I'm an extreme pragmatist, but wholesale revolutions in politics rarely end well. The Russians thought overthrowing the czar in 1917 was going to fix everything. Same with Cuba, Venezuela, and elsewhere. Revolutions beget counter-revolutions. There are ideas in Sanders' platform that would be wonderful to implement, but being a "rebel outsider" is not the best way to accomplish those ideas.
Wow ! Bernie even has a plan to eradicate the senate ? Colour me surprised ...   I'm kidding of course but let's not get to Trumpkin levels of conspiracy theory here !   Im more inclined to go with McCaskill and the notion that he isn't warm or collegial and hasn't made that many friends in the senate VS Joe who inspires friendship with almost anyone regardless of party
All these sort of drive by blanket smears do is hurt Sanders.   Sooner or later, you got to realize that "Us vs the democratic party" is a losing solution. You want votes, yet you smear the core of the people you need.  Bernie says "Not me, us" yet especially on reddit, it feels more like "Not me, us vs them".   Realize we're on the same side. Mostly we want the same things.  We may have different ideas how to get there, but ultimately if we actually want those things and not just yelling loudly our virtues on the internet, we all need each other.  So knock it off. Stop hurting your side.  Stop attacking your own side.  You can disagree on issues.  That's great. That's important stuff to talk about, but stop implying perverse motives by people who you actually need to be working with.
You're incorrectly representing what Biden said. He told rich people he wasn't going to demonize then,but he was going to raise their taxes. And,he said they're so rich a tax increase wouldn't even affect their lives. THAT'S what he meant wouldn't fundamentally change.  The fact that you have to lie to make your case shows you have a weak argument.
Yep. I got downvoted for saying I voted for Biden.
Jesse White is best Jesse 🇺🇸
Upvoting>actually voting
Yeah, I read on here that our revolution controls that group? I don’t go on there. I think all the awards they give the Bernie posts might be fake/not from actual users but are from that group? I’m fine with Bernie news, but they should give the sub a different name then...it’s misleading and manipulative.
The other day a Bernie bro time me to kill myself and I retorted it and it wasn't removed. I mocked a bros comment in another thread later and for banned for a day.it's such a shit show.
They live on another planet.
Oh I think Cory would be fantastic on the ticket. I don’t think that’s who will be selected. I feel like Jim Clyburn tipped his hand when he said he has a preference for an African American women   I feel like Stacy Abrams has got to be considered the front runner right now, or Kamala - but I have a feeling that it’s Abrams tbh
Yeah there were about 5 Jackson articles ahead of this. But if Harris had endorsed Bernie, you know that shit would have got a sticky there.
r/politics is fair and balanced news the same way Fox News is
Kamala Harris Endorses Joe Biden for President
Here's the tweet: https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1236622740930560001?s=19
Hopefully this is just enough to tip Washington.  A loss in every primary might be enough to end Bernie's scorched earth campaign.
And that girl that endorsed Joe Biden, was me!
Super Tuesday would've been nice, but better late than never.
Me too and I would like to see Kamala as VP.
Biden/Harris. Calling it now.
Too little, too late. She didn't endorse him when her endorsement could have made a tangible difference. I hope he gives her nothing!
Here's the [538 forecast for the next two Tuesday's](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/) sorted by date and then number of delegates @ stake. Biden is ahead in ALL of them at the moment except Idaho where he and Bernie are tied. Bernie likely won't hit the 15% viable threshold in Florida or Mississippi and possibly not in Missouri or Illinois. Hopefully Biden DOES meet or beat these forecasts and we can get Bernie out of the race or at least relegate him to the same attention Tulsi Gabbard is getting now.   **March 10, 2020**  Biden 76% - Michigan - 125 delegates  Biden 53% - Washington - 89 delegates  Biden 89% - Missouri - 68 delegates  Biden 96% - Mississippi - 36 delegates  Biden 50% - Idaho - 20 delegates  Biden 59% - North Dakota - 14 delegates    **March 17, 2020**  Biden 99% - Florida: 219 pledged delegates  Biden 82% - Illinois: 155 pledged delegates  Biden 75% - Ohio: 136 pledged delegates  Biden 65% - Arizona: 67 pledged delegates

Yang for VP, bro
Don't.  Don't do that to me.  I'll never get a chance to vote for her for President, don't get my hopes up for Vice President.
There are alot of people who have respect for her, even if she didn't get much votes in the primary.  No need to be hostile towards her man.
If you are referring to CA, I don’t think it would’ve mattered. Bernie was always going to grab a good portion of my neighbors due to the $7M Sanders invested in the state (vs. around $450K for Diamond Joe) plus the fact that, as a deeply progressive state, politics here have largely become an intramural sport  between Democrats.  Biden voters seem to have been baked into this contest since the get-go, given the tightening of the race we’re seeing in CA as more and more ballots are counted.  The folks that were already leaning towards Bernie wouldn’t have been swayed by a Kamala Harris endorsement.
She had to wait for Warren to exit. Her endorsement will pay dividends in the future.
Her endorsement could still make a difference.
Rules of the road homie. Not cool.
I hope that he chooses his cabinet based on who he feels would rally support from the country and do the best job, not who he thinks is most loyal to him personally.  The latter method is how Trump does it.
Quick, someone say some mean things about Idaho to make them vote for us!      Uhm....  Your potatoes are mediocre, at best, and if you don't vote Biden then you're, like, a real square.    Don't be a square, vote Biden 2020.
Biden: forms a broad coalition of support  Bernie bros: let me tell you how this is actually good for Bernie and a sign of the coming Revolution
I'm happy Biden is getting all these endorsements too!
What the hell is wrong with you? “I hope my opponent dies.” That is beyond hateful and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Disgusting
As a Bernie supporter you’re gross and not helping. Please consider *quietly* supporting Bernie if you can’t be a bit more mature than that.
That sounds awful lol... Completely different platforms and Andrew Yang does not appeal to the voters that actually matter.
Agree. She was my favorite early before I went to Pete and now Joe. Yeah, she took some shots we didn't like, but that's the game. She's good for the country, tough, and smart.
>  plus the fact that, as a deeply progressive state, politics here have largely become an intramural sport between Democrats.  We voted against legalizing pot I think twice, we voted against gay marriage. The state isn't as radically progressive as some want to think. Biden certainly wasn't going to win california and even without Boomberg's endorsement Biden is only trailing like 40-45 delegates behind bernie here. When the results are 100% in I'd be surprised if Bernie even crosses 35% of the vote.
this\^\^\^. She and Warren were apparently very close.  I give her props for being loyal to friends over politics. But glad she's joined our team now!
She had a good reason and when it she didn't we don't need to make enemies out of friends.
I appreciate that, personally. It's good to see who your friends *actually* are.   Now that she's officially team Joe, I wouldn't mind seeing her get the VP nod.
Independents, republicans, liberals and many right wingers
Or AG.
Yang does not appeal to those voters. Biden does not want UBI and the only thing Andrew is known for is UBI. It would never work.
'Biden became president today': Even Republicans are now deserting Trump over his coronavirus response
Lets not get too confident. A lot can happen between now and November.
Unfortunately there’s a huge difference between republicans and TRUMPublicans.
Aside from my loving this as a Biden supporter, I want to add it was such a well written article.   Absolutely worth your time while you and your family huddle in your grandfather’s old Cold War bunker.
>Joe Walsh, the Illinois ex-Congressman who recently attempted to challenge Trump in the GOP primary, predicted that Trump's disastrous speech and Biden's response would be remembered as an inflection point which boosted the former VP's chances of occupying the Oval Office at this time next year.  And we'll have an occupant that he won't claim is a Kenyan.  Walsh is trying to be a statesman, but he was pulling the birth certificate BS one short year ago.  Don't forget what trash Walsh is.
#\#actingpresidentbiden
This is the quote of the article for me...  >"After three and a half years of this absolute asshole  in the White House, the American people just want to breathe. And I  really believe that with Biden, they know him and they feel like they  can just pause and do just that."
I wish he were President today.  We cannot trust Trump to guide us through this plague.  Eight months is a long time when infections double weekly.
This is really hurting me right now. Honestly, I'd rather Trump handle this situation well and that lead to him getting re-elected instead of my preferred candidate. Because that would save thousands if not millions of lives.  But sadly, it's going to be January at the earliest that we can get rid of this guy.
But how many people actually saw the speech?
What if pence and trump die and we get acting president Nancy pelosi
Lol
Cannot stress this enough
>A lot can happen between now and November.  Too much can happen
Yeah and people behave different in a voting booth than what they present to the outside. I don't buy that suddenly they all just broke good.
Given the spread of this, a lot is guaranteed to happen.  A lot of bad things.  This isn't a tax break that can target California.  We can't work on a vaccine that'll only cure it in Wyoming, but not Massachusetts.  The same group that overwhelmingly votes is going to be the most vulnerable.  Hopefully they'll agree that if this is winning, we are indeed tired of winning so much.
Agree, but this is undeniably a bombshell on Trump’s appeal to many undecided voters come November. And let us not forget, those voters could certainly decide this race and catapult Biden into the Oval Office.
For one thing, Trump could die from coronavirus. We know he’s been exposed to it and he’s very old.
Yeah I'm getting real 2016 vibes from this headline.
Yup, Hillary was up +11 vs Trump in late March 2016
I hope a lot does happen. I would gladly trade a Biden presidency for Trump handling the COVID-19 situation well.
Hopefully
Thank you. We’ve been saying this for a while.
Trumplicans*
Yeah. My dad, Republican: Trump is the biggest idiot in the whole world and the *worst* person to be in charge through all of this.  My mom, Trumpublican: Why is Biden talking? Trump is going to handle this; I'm sure he's so mad at the CDC for screwing this up! Plus, I mean, how many people have died from the flu in Italy while all of this is going on?
And this election cycle, when your neighbor drops of corona, the old lady that sat next to you in church, because we sat idly by so the stock market wouldn't dip a little, we see republicans put the red/blue fight on hold and vote like Americans.
There are no Republicans any more. There's just Trump and his cult. The GOP is a lost cause.
[removed]
I'd say with his multiple exposures, Trump is infected. Maybe his anti-science, "I don''t need to learn anything I'm naturally talented" attitude may end up ending his presidency early.
She’s older than both of them. She’s 79.
That would be peak comedy. I’m down for it.
She'd make an amazing president and I'd rather have her in charge right now instead of Trump, or Biden
Hope that the most favorable polls are correct, work like the least favorable polls are correct
What concerns me is how short peoples memories are. By nov people may not even remember this especially after whatever october surprise bombshells will inevitably drop.
Let's hope not, much better to beat him.
As much as I hate to even consider the possibility, Joe could too if he's exposed to it. He's even older.
Can't we just take two states and give them to the TRUMPublicans and Berniecrats so the rest of us can live in peace?
I can't get over your banner. I love it. Also yeah, the GOP let the patients run the asylum when they gave in and let Sarah Palin run as VP and then couldn't convince the base not to vote for Trump. At this point I'm convinced that the only thing that will make Trump's base leave him is if they or their families start dropping dead. Even then, they probably won't because it would be too great of a shock to their sense of self. Admitting that Trump wasn't the best means admitting that liberals might have a had a point and that just doesn't sit well in their mind.
I wanna believe this is true, but for now, I can’t. The people that are most at risk are the ones that watch the Fox News shows that say it’s all a hoax or isn’t to be taken seriously. Some on the network are starting to speak out, but Trump and Fox News have such a hold on the people who don’t know any better and it’s sad. It’ll unfortunately take serious tragedy for them to wake up and realize that we’re living under one of the most incompetent leaders in history.
Unfortunately, this is mostly true. I know some people still in the party trying to change it from the inside, but Trump and his goons have pretty much hijacked the party for good it seems.
Whatever.
I wanted Trump out of office, but not like this
"This just in. Scientists at the CDC now believe that hate, ignorance, and narcissism present some sort of natural immunity to COVID-19. They are still trying to understand the mechanism behind this."
But she's also *less* likely to touch her face during an pandemic and stare into a fucking eclipse
Whoa, I thought she was in her sixties.
She could be president until January if something happens to Trump and Pence
Doubtful. Big pandemics like this often subside in the summer, but come *roaring* back in the fall.
People know how much money they have. The crux of Trump’s re-election argument is “you may not like me, but your 401K does.” If the stock market in November is below or near or just slightly above where it was January 2017, he’s screwed.
Bloomberg’s attack ads will take care of that problem.
Dead family members tend to extend memory.
Yes, I personally (as a former republican) want to crush him by a landslide.
California and Texas have all asked to secede in the past. Let’s give them those
Everything Fox News talks about is "over there".  The migrant caravan, for example, it wasn't something you'd see.  Hell, unless you know a soldier stationed in Afghanistan or Iraq, it's a nebulous problem "over there".  Your neighbor, your friend, your spouse getting sick, maybe dying, that's gonna hit home and leave a mark.
I'd like to see him face legal and financial ruin for his crimes, but he can do a hell of a lot of damage in the 9+ months before he's subject to any kind of accountability. If the virus gets him first, the benefit of being rid of him is well worth missing out on the trial. That benefit can be measured in more-deserving lives saved, not just from coronavirus but in health care, immigration, environmental regulation, and all the other ways Trump's uniquely bad decisions are getting people killed. And I'd much rather he be killed by his own negligence than by someone who would have to go to jail for it.
I don't think it'll be a landslide. It'll be a close election. Biden is still the underdog.
I like those states, they can have North and South Dakota.
I was thinking more like Guam and Bikini Atoll. :)
Rules of the Road

You can’t just take malarkey and replace it with no malarkey and expect everything to get better. You need anti-malarkey policies, and that’s the Rules of the Road.
This makes my Pete heart so happy 💙💛
Can we get the ROTR in the sidebar for those who aren't as intimately familiar with them as the Pete transplants? And if we can work "malarkey" in there for some Team Joe flavor, even better.  Edit: Got it guys, thanks.
 THE NEW RULES OF THE ROAD! #ROTR4JOE  RESPECT  BELONGING  TRUTH  TEAMWORK  BOLDNESS  RESPONSIBILITY  SUBSTANCE  DISCIPLINE  EXCELLENCE  JOY  NO MALARKEY
For those new to Pete's ROTR (and now hopefully Joe's ROTR by proxy)  RESPECT In our thoughts, words, and actions we cultivate a sense of respect. ​We respect one another on this team, we respect the office of the Presidency, and we respect every individual we encounter on the campaign trail, including our competitors. ​The better we hold up this value among ourselves, the better it will reflect outside. It will represent a quiet antidote to the idea that this project is too audacious to be taken seriously.  BELONGING We seek to serve and unify a diverse nation. Let us build a campaign team and a coalition of supporters that kindly embraces and reflects the increasingly diverse party and country to which we belong. We will honor this value not just in our makeup but in our practices, as we proactively work to include people of different backgrounds and viewpoints in every major decision, and cultivate a sense of welcome to all.  TRUTH Honesty is in our nature, and it is one of our greatest means of restoring faith in our democracy among everyday Americans and building a national movement rooted in trust and faith in our country and our beliefs. Internally and externally, our effort will be characterized by fidelity to the truth.  TEAMWORK We are all working in service of our country and to elect a President who will represent our values and make American lives better. In moments of disagreement, the temptations of pride and ego will arise. Rooted in our mission, let our common purpose be a touchstone as we foster a climate of trust and mutual respect.  BOLDNESS We will not hesitate to take bold stances and to accept risk in the defense of our values. Our respect is reserved for people, not for conventions. We accept no truisms without questioning. The spirit of originality will create the pressure and permission for us to do things not done before, to stand out from the crowd not by waving our arms for attention but by the fact of being different.  RESPONSIBILITY The conduct of a campaign can be as influential as its outcome. Everyone on this team has a responsibility to live up to our values, and every participant, from a first-time volunteer to the candidate and top staff, must model this. When there is a mistake, we take ownership, learn, adjust, and move on. Missteps are inevitable, but they should never be repeated. We own our choices and our work.  SUBSTANCE There is no point mounting an unorthodox, underdog campaign unless it is one of substance. We have the opportunity to bring meaningful ideas forward for debate. We will take questions seriously and answer them directly. We will lay aside the superficial in favor of the meaningful. We embrace complicated challenges, and will work to improve the overall dialogue in how campaigns talk about policy.  DISCIPLINE A project like ours will require enormous discipline. Through energy and determination, we will handle our resources with the stewardship they deserve, mindful that this campaign is fueled by the gift of other people’s time, money, relationships, and reputations.  EXCELLENCE A functioning presidential campaign is such a marvel that we may at times be amazed simply by the fact of what we are doing. But the standard we should hold ourselves to in every part of our work is not whether it is at the level of a presidential campaign, but whether it is at the level we would expect of the best presidential campaign of this time.  JOY Amid the great challenge we have accepted, let us be joyful. We are privileged to be in the very center of the most important conversation in the world. We are assembling a team of wonderful human beings. Along the way we will all get many opportunities to lift one another up and lift up those we encounter. The American presidential election is the world’s greatest civic and democratic ritual. It will shape us but we can shape it too. Let us shape it, partly, by spreading the joy of working for our beliefs.
As a recent Pete convert, can I just say how much I love that y'all are also using the RotR here? That was a really important core of his supporter's actions and responses to all of the online hate that flooded our way here and on Twitter. Glad to see that it lives on!
I come from Team Pete and I think Biden coalition and his supporters are the best possible example of the "Belonging" rule of the road. I am still bittersweet but also very proud to be part of this coalition.
"The fabric of our complex society is woven too tightly to permit any part of it to be damaged without damaging the whole."-- Joe Biden, Promises to Keep, 2008   When you see Americans going after Americans, Joe reminds us who we are punching at... It's Ourselves.  No Malarkey.
I hope somehow it makes it back to Pete that ROTR were applied here. It makes my soul sing.
After browsing the Bernie subs, this is a breath of fresh air. I love how quickly most of the party is coming together, we need to more than anything if we want to beat Trump like a drum!
Rotr! Rotr! ❤️❤️❤️
Yes, please remember that we should not behave like the worst among another campaign who bullied, trolled, insulted, and alienated us.   We are better than that, and we should not make the same mistakes of pushing any good faith voters away and setting a bad example for our own movement.
Great post!  I wasn’t a Pete supporter, so only learned about the RotR yesterday.  But thank you guys for bringing them here.   With Bloomberg dropping out, Joe’s nomination is inevitable everybody.  We have the majority of the Democratic Party in our lane.  That doesn’t mean we should get complacent, but we have to be honest that this train is ultimately going to keep rolling until November.   That means we have to be understanding and respectful to Sanders supporters from here on out.  I know I’m going to try to keep from getting angry with their attacks because I know they’re coming from a place of sadness.  But if we’re welcoming and understanding, we can start building the movement that is going to carry the Democratic Party to victory.  Both to the White House and to Congress.   We’re going to win in November.  And we’re going to bring real change to Washington and to America.
I believe that the Rules of the Road not only made me a better supporter, but also a better person. It means so much to see them transfer over to Team Joe! Thank you all for being so welcoming!
NO MALARKEY POSTING 😤😤
I can't begin to express how happy it makes me that you folks have embraced the rules of the road. I've always thought the Biden campaign was among the most ROTR-friendly, and this has really taken it to another level. The ROTR mean so much to me that I've had them memorized for months; they're one of my favorite parts of Pete's campaign. I'm so thrilled to be working alongside all of you!
This is how we win, together <3
I too came over from Pete's team. This makes me so happy! It's a great credo, and it just naturally fits Joe's persona anyway. And that's no malarkey.
How is it possible this community is so small?  I find it so odd that someone with so much real support has so much less online.  It's a good reminder that twitter and reddit are not real life... but still I wonder if theres ways to grow this community and how the campaign could pay more attention to doing this.
So happy to see the ROTR over here.

Thank you Joe for adopting this. It really helps the supporters to keep their behavior and their comments in check and keep us all on the right track.
Should No Malarkey be added as an 11th rule of the Road or should it be added on to Truth "That means no Malarkey." , just an example, at the end or somewhere else?
Warrens dropping out soon, or rather she’s “reassessing” her campaign.
Another Team Pete member now on Team Joe here and I have I say, when Pete first put out the ROTR I was so impressed to see a campaign doing that. I’m very excited to see them being used over here as well!
[removed]
Am I unbanned yet?? Come on mods. Y’all were too hasty and I’ve messaged twice now :(
[removed]
Super happy ROTR are alive here!
Biggest plot twist of the 2020 election is that the secret 11th rule of the road was "NO MALARKEY" all along
As a #BidenEdgeEdge supporter, I approve this message.
I love this haha
“No malarkey” should be the 11th ROTR
About the extent of his policies right there
Same! Everyone has been so welcoming of Team Pete for Joe and it makes me really feel good about my decision to support Biden.
> Truth (No Malarkey)
Direct ROTR [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/wiki/rulesoftheroad?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Now *this* is the type of campaign I’m proud to support.
Already are
And I mean *NO MALARKEY*
Just replace Truth with No Malarkey and we good
*No Malarkey!
100% agree. This was one of the best things about Pete’s campaign and I don’t think I’d want to be actively involved with any other that didn’t do this. It just makes sense! Feels good too.
r/neoliberal also uses it!!!
> Yes, please remember that we should not behave like the worst among another campaign who bullied, trolled, insulted, and alienated us.  Plenty from your side have already been doing this and it was especially amped up yesterday. Just remember come November you’ll need the votes of progressives like us and we’ll be more than happy to let you and this party be buried, Biden and you guys have to earn our votes now.   >We are better than that, and we should not make the same mistakes of pushing any good faith voters away and setting a bad example for our own movement.  Except some in your base are not better than that and have been perpetuating bad faith discussions.
Yeah, I’m just learning about this too, and I don’t get it. Do we really need specific rules to not be awful to people? The Warren sub has gotten along with them totally fine, and I’m kinda confused why this sub need them.
Because we're all over on r/neoliberal come join us there too! :)
If you build it, they will come!  Seriously, it's small, but it's ACTIVE and it's grown by 7k people recently. It'll come!
I've been a Joe fan since before 2008. He was my candidate in the primary, but he didn't make it to Super Tuesday. When the media was camped outside of his house when the rumors of him being Obama's running mate started going around, I camped out in my living room flipping between all the news stations. I've read his memoir and still pulled up those adorable memes about the transition to Trump regularly. I am one of the original Biden fans.   That said, I don't think it occurred to me to even look for Joe Biden subreddit until someone mentioned the Bernie sub, and I thought, hah, I wonder if Joe has one. I mentioned it last night at the watch party I went to, and the guy I was talking to chuckled and said incredulously, "Of course there's a Joe subreddit." I just think the people Joe appeals to probably aren't spending a lot of time on Reddit.
Okay, I like Michelle as much as the next gal, but we have to stop this. Of course, we should be nice to the Sanders supporters, because we all want something similar, just in a different way, but we have to stop trying to take the high road when it comes to the Republicans. Once this ugly stain on our history is in the rearview mirror, people need to go to prison. They need to be made an example of what happens when you try to undermine our democracy and our Constitution.   Steyer said something in an interview that I liked. I can't quote it, but it was basically, if he's elected, he's not going to bother trying to work with the Republicans, because whenever Democrats try to reach across the aisle, it just means that they give and Republicans just steamroll. He said there's no point, that he would behave like a Republican would. And we could argue the validity of that if we were still in the Bush years, but the fact that I consider those "the good ol' days" makes me shake my head.   So my opinion is that the motto should be, "When they go low, we kick them in the head." Trump doesn't have good policy, intellect, or even sanity. Going high will do nothing against him.  And that's why I liked Bloomberg. I didn't think he should be the nominee, of course, but I like that he is the child in the race, bullying the bully, lowering himself to Trump's level, and driving the man crazy doing it.  I didn't mean to hijack your comment, but I literally have been bashing "we go high" in my head several times a day for weeks, months, years, so seeing it here convinced me to make the stretch and just say it. I do think the ROTR are very valuable, but only for people who value them, too.  ETA, in case it's not clear: I'm not talking about Republicans in general, but the politicians and the bad actors. The Republican party members are in a very sad situation, and when this is all said and done, I think they are going to need a good bit of empathy, because for a few of them, it's going to be like leaving a cult. However, when it comes to people who don't fight fair, lie, cheat and steal, forget them. To paraphrase a famous politician, "Lock them up!"
Her people are legitimately frustrated that she's gotten so little attention for her amazing level of talent and effort, and when some of them arrive here I want to welcome them as warmly as you welcomed us Pete folks.
Welcome to the Joealition 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

I think that's just Truth and Substance lol
BidenEdgeEdge. Love it. Who’s making the t-shirts?
I prefer #PB&J
A little special nod to all the Buttigang on Team Joe.
I sort of feel like Truth + Substance + Discipline = No Malarkey.
...I don't think we do. There's a lot of "dunking on leftists" there.
Edit: took out something that was a misunderstanding of your comment.  I’m sorry that you’ve dealt with bad behavior. We know what it feels like to be subjected to abuse from another campaign. Posts like this, that reinforce the structural moral values and attitudes of our campaigns, are how we work on reigning it in and doing better.

Yeah.  I wouldn't call myself a neoliberal.  But it's good to know there is an online community or two for biden.   It seems very sparse.
No. I am a socialist, and I don’t want exploitative neoliberalism. I’m here to discuss and support an administratively competent candidate, not an ideology which fundamentally relies on the perpetuation of economic inequality.
I too am an original biden fan (from his 2008 run).  Loved his working class credentials and his Iraq plan.  But I am also an original progressive kuccinich fan,  I'd say kuccinich was my fave back then.  Anyway I've been coming to reddit looking for his subs scratching my head wondering what is going on.  As much as I love biden, I have to say he has to get more movement online.  Last candidate I remember thinking needed more online activity was hillary.  So you understand what I mean.
No disagreement from me. I have nothing but respect for Warren. I think she would make a good VP pick.
Thanks! While obviously things didn’t work out the way I was hoping they would, I’m proud to be fighting back against malarkey with you guys
Add me to that list too
Where did you get the flair, if you don't mind me asking?
👍🏼
Yes yes. But "you cant take malarkey and replace it with not malarkey" made me chuckle out loud. Totally stealing this
Hey y'all.
Well we use the “DONT bridgade and harass other supporters part” but that doesn’t mean we can’t joke among ourselves.
For the record I do appreciate the message of the post. Also thank you for your civility, I hope more folks have your attitude then being vindictive and sore winners. Surely those of your folks who have been attacking other bases know that you can’t win the election without the help of progressives unless you want another HRC 2016 result. Plus if there’s any chance of Biden turning Texas purple or blue you will need every single Sanders supporter like myself going to the polls come November.

We're social liberals, hope it's not the name that scares you lol, I know how much of a pejorative it's become.
Need her in the senate, there's a GOP governor in MA who would choose her replacement :\\
Aww, Dicta, long time no see.
You can customize from the settings.
The top right menu if you're on the Reddit app
Gotta get me that flair.
You’re right!   Thank you for coming by and sharing with us! I hope you feel welcome here, because your perspective is valuable to us and to our shared values.
Yeah, if she's not President, I want her back in the Senate. She's a damn pit bull and a capital D Democrat. She's still got bits of Bloomberg in her teeth.
He would chose himself   Already have the lowliest Kennedy trying to get his senate seat before everyone fights for it
I’ve been at a work conference that couldn’t have come at a worse time considering Pete’s news lol so I took a few days offline to focus on the conference. Now I’m back and many of our r/pete_buttigieg mods have joined the mod ranks here. We are all stronger together and I’m happy to still be working for Pete’s vision of America, even if it’s a different vision than it was a week ago. LFG
Thanks!
Thanks!
Totally agree. And if this sub is adopting the ROTR, we all have some work to do here too. No time to waste ramping up to November. Pitter patter!
Look at the shiny new flair!
😁
I keep thinking about how 12 years ago Joe Biden and Sarah Palin were debating for Vice President. And now he’s the Democratic frontrunner and she’s singing Baby Got Back in a bear costume.
Worst decision of John McCains career. Not that I think he would have beaten Obama but Palin choice stands alone as a pure political play that did him no favors.
She was really the beginning of the malarkey.
dress for the job you *want*
Was.  She was thrown off the show for being terrible.  Just like her VP election.  And her marriage.
My favorite SNL cold open is still the Tina Fey/Amy Poehler announcement about sexism in the campaign.  Right up there with grim reaper Steve Bannon and Jeff Sessions on the mantle.  Oh, and Omarosa pounding on the windows.  Man, there have been some good ones these last four years.
🎶 One of these things is not like the others, one of these things does not belong🎶...
Sounds like things worked out about right.
Palin was such a hamfisted political move as VP pick. I'm glad we have a true grassroots politician representing us in No Malarkey Joe!
As it should be
Sheesh. That's sad
the system works
McCain would be proud.
Moments like this remind me that sometimes Karma does kick in.
Self-actualization is a beautiful thing.
And her performance was still the more coherent one.
I don't think there was any way a Republican could have won in 2008 after the disastrous Bush administration. The Democrats could have run almost anybody and won, but Obama certainly helped widen the margin. McCain knew he had to gamble for a slim chance of victory, but society ended up bearing the cost.
McCain wanted to pick Joe Lieberman, but advisors talked him out of it.
One of my city's alternative weeklies ran the 2008 endorsements edition with a drawing of Palin in the style of the "HOPE" drawing, but with "NOPE". Needless to say, John McCain did not receive their endorsement.
He was forced to pick a religious right true believer. Some people think he deliberately picked an idiot in the hopes that he could replace her with a national security focused choice later.
GOP forced Palin on McCain.
IMO, She was a symptom, but she was definitely the canary in the coal mine of Malarkey.
What about newt Gingrich though?
Meh, I'd go with Newt as the beginning of the malarkey, but Palin was the first sign that it was growing stronger than the Republican party as a whole.
>She was thrown off the show for being terrible  Thank Pete
Everyone is up in arms about the Liz vid, but that's the best thing to come out of last week's Daniel Craig episode. Plus that Heidi sketch Deep Quotes. Maybe it just feels that bad coming off of Mulaney/Byrne.
Yup... Joe has his good and bad points, but he's as genuine as they come, and that's amazingly refreshing after several years of insane lizard-beings being in power.
Well, shit. If Lieberman had been McCain's running mate, he probably would have left the Senate. Which means he wouldn't have been there when they were voting on the ACA. Which means we might have gotten a public option...
This is so true!
>Everyone is up in arms about the Liz vid  What happened in the Liz vid...?
Or a Republican might have won his seat and we'd have another failed attempt at healthcare reform.
True.
NEW: @JoeBiden now supporting free public college/universities for those whose families make less than $125,000, according to senior camp official.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this similar to what Pete proposed?
Warren is about to endorse Joe, I am 95% sure!
I love how you still have Bernie supporters in the comments grumbling about how this isn’t enough and arguing for Bernie or bust . Why not appreciate the gestures as they come? Seriously. Either Joe is ignoring progressives or he’s pandering. He cannot win with these people
Does it scale up to full price from $125k or is it just a hard threshold?
Anyone know how much this plan will cost? I worry that this will hurt him in the general election.
Unpopular opinion, I don’t support this. We shouldn’t be using taxpayer money on free college for all. Free community college is more than enough. We need to address failing infrastructure, implementing public option, and heavy renewable investment first and foremost. After that, we should attempt to balance the budget since our national debt is ballooning at an immense level. After all of that is done, then I would be open to this. Right now it’s too soon (I say this as someone who paid 70k in student loans off).
Hey, it's the means-tested-free-college plan from Pete's.
Unpopular opinion: I don’t like this, Biden’s already got the nomination in the bag and he doesn’t need to go any further left
Not really happy about this.....
Oh boy, Biden is on the slippery slope.
I liked the community college subsidization plan but I fear this new plan will just continue to inflate the cost of tuition at state schools, like what student loans have been doing, at the cost of the tax payers.
Here it is: https://govtrackinsider.com/college-for-all-act-would-aim-to-eliminate-tuition-for-families-making-under-125-000-c57a5760576d
He officially announced on Twitter that he's including parts from both Warren's and Sanders' plans in his platform. It's actually a pretty clever move; he's trying to get support from Warren and Sanders once he becomes the nominee. Plus, it seems like Trump's chances for reelection are getting weaker now during this whole fiasco.
For what it's worth, Joe just won this progressive's vote *and* volunteer hours! Make Warren VP, and I'll start donating!
Really don't like this change in policy.  Oh well, it probably won't pass, and either way he's still better than Trump...
So... Pete's plan?
Biden seems to be adopting what Ned Lamont has done in CT, namely the 15/hr minimum wage and free public college.
It's an improvement I guess. I hope it appeals to progressives, we're gonna need more young voters to beat Trump.
Another Biden plan which would be huge for me. Right now I'm struggling to figure out how to go back to college to finish my Bachelor's degree. Even with all the laons I can get and pell, it'll be hard to pay for everything. I need something like this.
nice
Good! Biden owes a lot of his current strength to other candidates dropping out and supporting him, so it makes sense that he'd try to syncretize his policies with theirs.
😊
What about student loans for the rest of us in that bracket?
Ugh I hated this plan of Bernie's more than anyone. It is completely elitist to have everyone paying for the 30% or so that go to college, and with zero requirement to graduate, pay it back, etc. Why not just get drunk for 3 years then go to trade school? You didnt have to pay for it!
As a Sanders/Warren supporter who shifted to Biden once my first choice candidates were no longer viable, I’m thrilled about this.  One of the things I respect about Joe vs Bernie is that Joe seems to want to be the president for the entire country, not just those who agree with him. Bernie is uncompromising, which is why he was unable to grow his base.  The fact is, most younger people lean to the left of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party. We need those people to defeat Trump in the general, and to set us up to continue winning in the future.  The one other thing I’d like to see from Biden is cooperating with the Sunrise Movement to create a more expansive climate change platform. What he has is good but doesn’t go far enough, in my opinion.
I was undecided between Warren and Biden.     You have no idea how unbelievably happy I am that he's shifting left on some issues that I really care about.    Warren better be holding his feet to the fire for universal HC and environmental policy.  MAKE HIM WORK FOR THAT ENDORSEMENT, LIZZIE
For everyone who is unhappy about this, I get it, but this is compromise. Compromise is necessary to get things done. In this case, the compromise will help consolidate the progressive vote and help Joe do much better in the general election. In the future he may have to compromise in the other direction. It's good to know that he is willing and capable of doing it. We praise Joe for these types of characteristics, so we shouldn't be surprised when he actually follows through. Also, this plan is still far cheaper than Bernie's and is basically what Pete was proposing.  That being said, I'm glad to see that everyone isn't just falling in line and voicing concerns that they have. Shows that we think for ourselves and aren't trapped in a cult of personality like supporters of some other people are.
I want lower costs at community colleges and state schools.   I think they should still have low interest public loans with options of refinancing and forgiveness.   There are people with bad degrees that don't go into their field.  He's not going to follow through on this.    I don't want to cover your daughter's or son's acting degree.
This is bad policy and bad politics.    **Bad policy** The core of the college debt problem is the expense of undergraduate tuition. This will make the problem worse because the federal government is handing state colleges a blank check to charge as much as they want and promising the federal government will cover it.  Their incentive is now to charge as much as possible and the incentive of students is to ignore cost entirely.  The federal government budget will face accelerating strain so every state college employee can have skyrocketing salaries, every facility will be spruced up, etc.  Contractors will lobby state governments to make wasteful, expensive projects for universities and pass on the costs to the federal government in the form of tuition hikes that students won’t pay.  All of this is money that could be going to help the poor and instead will go to whoever state governments and colleges bestow it upon.  **Bad politics** People chose Joe Biden and his vision over the Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders version.  I understand that Biden wants the support of Sanders supports in the general election, but the Bernie or busters aren’t going to be appeased and the rest would have voted for him anyway. This will just undermine his support among everyone and make him look intellectually dishonest. Because it is an intellectually dishonest move.
On the one hand, i support this, but i do know that most of my fellow leftists are on-board regardless, and the Jimmy-Dore progressives? Well, they are impossible to satisfy.  But its nice that Joe is extending a hand, thanks.
I don't like this tbh, this is just pandering and making it free won't help the high costs
Is there any place to see the policy?
Would that cover out of state schools as well, or only in state school?
What about those who came from families making less than 125k but graduated already with a mountain of debt? Not including the small refinements to the existing IBR plan which means the debt is cancelled after 20 years.   Warren's plan was a cancellation up to 50k immediately, not at the end of 20 years when you're already a senior citizen. She reportedly met with Biden 2 days ago. Did they not talk about that plan then?
Looking good guys!
id go back to school and learn spanish 😂😂😂
Nice
This makes me like Biden better, but I'm still voting for Sanders if he is still on the ballot for the nomination in my state of Kansas.
PETE PETE PETE!    Love you Joe!    Seriously this... taking all the best parts of other people's programs, is smart, shrewd, and inclusive.    LOVE.  IT.
This is a bad policy. He should adopt our approach here in the England.
This is pretty cool of Joe to do this. I think this will help people out.
It is more similar to Peres plan, but calling it Bernies plan make it seem like he is trying to reach out to progressives. Also if Biden wants to adopt any of Pete’s platform maybe he can adopt some of the Democratic reform stuff since or some veterans policy
Pete's was free for under 100k and sliding scale subsidies for up to 150k.
Yes!
Also nearly identical to what Hillary had proposed.  And if we can pass it, it'll be an enormous step forward given that *totally free college for all incomes* is a virtual non-starter in this political environment.
It's similar. It's actually quite a bit closer to Hillary's old plan.   I'm sure Pete and Hillary are aware though of why they have to "pretend" this is only Bernie's policy...it sucks but that's the way people have to do politics,. and the media is screaming that Bernie needs more "credit."
Oh god, please yes. I don’t care about her age, give me Warren as VP any day of the week.
Because Bernie talks about perfection and the only reason why we don't have perfection is because of "those" people oppose it. They are conditioned to believe that there is some well organized group opposing him versus basic human selfishness.
The "pandering" accusation is seriously annoying. I mean... isn't the whole point of a representative democracy that the elected officials should support policies that the voters want? Isn't that *exactly how it's supposed to work*?
Trump = Nothing, Biden = help for the neediest.  Bernie Bros = "That's it! I'm just gonna vote Trump now!!!"
>I love how you still have Bernie supporters in the comments grumbling about how this isn’t enough and arguing for Bernie or bust . Why not appreciate the gestures as they come? Seriously. Either Joe is ignoring progressives or he’s pandering. He cannot win with these people    It's hard to get enthusiastic about other people's plans when all of Sander's policies ignore all possible negative repercussions.
'Cause millionaires and billionaires don't make enough money I guess.
Biden is making the same mistake Warren did. It doesn’t help to be Bernie Sanders Lite. The minority of people who like Bernie Sanders don’t want the Lite version, they want the real thing. The majority of people who don’t like Bernie Sanders don’t want the Lite version either. This is going to make Biden look unprincipled without gaining him support. And it’s a bad policy idea.  I still support him, but less enthusiastically than I did yesterday.
I’m a Bernie/Warren supporter who is really happy about this move. I think it will make a huge difference for a lot of people. Also, I was ready to support Joe 100% when it became clear that he would be the nominee. But I was really hoping he would adopt some of the Bernie or Warren student loan/college cost plans.
That's what I'd like to know. I'm usually against hard caps. I'd imagine the legislation would be heavily modified from existing proposed bills out there if it actually had a good chance of passing.
Yeah that’s what I’d like to know as well. $125k might be a lot for a single income but for a two income family that’s just two people making $62k a year each. That’s not exactly the ultra rich. If they have to pay full price and people who make slightly less pay nothing, that’s kind of shitty.
Pete managed to pay for all of his plans which included things like this. So it should be entirely affordable. (petes proposals ran a surplus)
I’m pretty sure free college is supported, though by a somewhat narrow margin. Id imagine this proposal - a “middle ground” of sorts - would be even more supported.
While I can't answer for this proposal specially, New York state already does something similar (SUNY, CUNY, and CC are free for in state families making under 100k) and that gets paid for
Many state schools are fairly cheap. $8k/year or so. Kids at that income level, especially the poorer ones, already receive some aid.  Public schools aren't too much of the student debt problem. Private schools are. And grad/professional degrees are even more of the problem.
I agree.  And unless I'm mistaken, which is possible, none of the 'free college' plans actually do anything to address the cost, just shift who is paying those costs to taxpayers.  How come when people see the rising costs of drugs everyone loses their shit about drug companies, but when people see rising college costs no one scrutinizes how colleges are spending that money?    Liberals are running full speed towards subsidizing the existing system without questioning if the system as it is today is worth keeping the same.  Community colleges are significantly more efficient with their money than four year schools, and some online education programs have started with tech facing jobs that are getting people jobs at companies like Google and Microsoft at a fraction of the price of four year colleges.  And they don't even charge you unless you get a job where you make at least 50k/year.    Against Trump I'll vote blue for sure, but if even the 'moderate' dems are going to move further and further left then in the future I may just abstain if I have to choose between far right and far left candidates that leave me with no home.
If we want people at the bottom to catch up free community college is a better idea.    Free public college will just mean less debt for middle-class (mostly) white people.   There are people(mostly minorities)  who graduated from poor schools and had home lives that did not prepare them for college; they will not be able to get into  good 4 year colleges.  The gap will widen.  Every lazy mediocre middle-class asshole who had all the advantages and took college prep classes will get accepted before them.  With no cost there is no reason why single every Tyler will not just attend college for a year and flunk out because they partied and drank the whole time.  It's going to be 13th grade from middle-class kids; there will be no financial consequences.    The priority needs to be Pre-K and K-12 first; then community college, and trade-schools, also Tribal Colleges and HBCUs.  We can't let the youngest and most vulnerable fall behind.  We can still do things to lower tuition costs, strengthen federal subsidies, and reduce debt in the mean time. We should also go further regulating for-profit colleges and provide complete debt forgiveness to their victims.
Same, and I'm actually in college right now. Not a fan of my tax payer dollars being spent even more inefficiently. The costs of college are ridiculous, we need to work to lower them across the board -- not cut them entirely. At best I support community colleges being tuition-free with the requirement being you obtain a degree. I'm also not sure I support cancelling student loan debt (as someone who also has debt).
I mean Hillary ran on this during 2016. Cuomo implemented this in New York.
I dont get a vote but I feel like this will push away moderate republican voters he's won over. Hope I'm wrong.
The point of adopting this plan is to build bridges for Bernie people so Joe can attract more of them when Bernie eventually drops out.
exactly, I’d rather have increased scholarships for specific careers, like cover 20% of the students loans if they choose to study education, and we always need more teachers
Agreed.
We are also about to enter a recession. I'd rather we help people who are about to be in dire financial straights because of the pandemic.
I voted for Biden, so i'm not a Bernie bro. But surly some of the debt should be adjusted.
https://govtrackinsider.com/college-for-all-act-would-aim-to-eliminate-tuition-for-families-making-under-125-000-c57a5760576d  This is the plan Biden is adopting. So Berners are wrong when they say it's not Bernie's plan in the replies of his tweet
Pete's plan was apparently for families who make less than $100,000.
 I mean Hillary ran on this during 2016. Cuomo implemented this in New York.
I think that's basically all he's going to concede. He might endorse marijuana legalization, but that's all.
Exactly my concerns. I feel like universities get off Scott free for their ridiculous prices.
It's exactly what will happen. I voted for Biden in part to avoid this garbage. Wtf
I am all for almost all of Biden's platform, except his gun control policies, $15 minimum wage, and now this change to his college subsidization policy.  I'm not really a fan of his drift further leftward but I do appreciate that he is trying to compromise.  I hope he can stay moderate enough for the general election.  I think a change in gun control policy would make him really popular with moderates, independents, and moderate republicans.
Do you have a financial aid package yet? If you qualify for the Pell, you likely also qualify for scholarships.
Seriously. All of us who took out loans to get educated are now not only paying for ourselves but other people to go to college too? Is this some sort of joke?
These “free college” plans almost always include trade school.
No reason not too. Take the productive class's free money and party hearty.
That and legalizing marijuana (not just rescheduling it) would go a very long way in convincing progressives to turn out.
That's how you lose the moderate republicans. No thanks, I don't want Joe to do what Hillary did which costed her the election.
This.
I'm pretty sure Biden already has free community college in his platform.  Also, this new announcement applies to students' in-state school only. I don't know about your state, but the state I went to high school in had around $10k in-state tuition for the flagship and $6-8k for other schools. If I'd gone there, my Pell grant would have covered about a third of that and I'd likely gotten several scholarships that would have covered the rest of tuition. So we're already mostly doing this, other than states with schools that are ridiculously priced or have an expensive flagship.
They need to make student loans defaultable.  That will bring tuition costs down.
First paragraph is the best paragraph on this whole forum. Second is good too.
Pete’s plan for black Americans was also fantastic, specifically the parts about entrepreneurship and that area.
This is the bill he’s supporting I believe. And it’s literally written by Bernie and Rep Jayapal. So I think it really is the same one.    https://govtrackinsider.com/college-for-all-act-would-aim-to-eliminate-tuition-for-families-making-under-125-000-c57a5760576d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
i do not wish to be confrontational, but i am aware i may come off that way anyway.  are you implying that you do not wish joe to reach out to progressives?
Happy cake day!
And an objectively bad idea anyway.
Endorsing doesn't mean that she's going to be VP.
I want Warren in charge of investigating Trump's corrupt ass if the dems win both the house and senate.
How about no because Massachusetts has a Republican governor who gets to appoint her replacement.
I doubt it, at best Warren will become Secretary of Education, depending on Senate results.
Nah. Kamala Harris over Elizabeth Warren.
[removed]
I am curious not attacking but how do you feel Bernie is selfish? I honestly come in peace. I just want to get an impression of what things are like on your side of the fence
Former Warren supporter here. This is one of the details about her plans that really drew me in. Like her student loan forgiveness was phased out above $250k, but still had marginal impact below that. It seems like a fair, effective way to do it where it benefits those who need it most.
Why black people stan joe Biden
This is such an important distinction. People dismiss it like “he was just Obama’s VP”  He was an incredibly loyal to the *first black president* who had almost no experience when he had been in the senate for 30 years. Despite not only the racial dynamic, but the age gap, the experience gap, and the massive backlash against Obama, he never once strayed from being absolutely loyal to his president. He took his cues from a guy who had been in national government for less than 1/5 the time he had. And the most disloyal thing he ever did was accidentally out Obama as being in favor of marriage equality.
In all the nonsense this primary has regurgitated, fact is, Joe Biden gives a shit. He does it everyday. Nevertheless he beats trump. Joe Biden cares about all of us.
I think I saw earlier on reddit that joe had undermined Obama one time  *in support of gay marriage*
There was that one time when Joe kind of took the lead and made Barack move forward a bit sooner than he otherwise might have: coming out in support of gay marriage. I think that one has aged pretty well though.
Joe and the Biden supported and comforted the Obamas while they were stonewalled by Congress and weathered an untold volume of truly vile personal attacks. Maybe some of y’all don’t remember, but that shit was bad. What Obama inherited was a collapsed economy and two wars. Joe served, loved, and respected Obama through hard times. We remember the Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony. We know Joe.
Never thought about it that way.
Watch the Medal of Freedom ceremony.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzBFR2EE8hM     Joe received the award and proceeded to tell everyone in the room how great Barack was.    He didnt use that moment to tell people how great of a job that HE had done!!     that says something about the man
Powerful and well put.
If you want a dose of amazing, check out when Barack presents Joe with the Medal of Freedom.
*Preach*
This is so beautifully-written!
Racial injustice is *the* black mark against the nation.  Joe Biden gets it.

Also, they had a great friendship based on mutual respect and affection, I haven't forgotten the bracelets
So you’re saying that Biden did not want to [primary Obama](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/bernie-sanders-primary-obama-2012-social-security.html) in 2012, but instead respected him and backed him as Obama saved this country from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression?   Huh.
I interpret "he was Obama's vp" comments as saying he was a VP like Pence, who just sits passively in the background and does nothing.  Biden got a lot of work done as VP, and all at the direction and in support of Obama.  He wasn't just his VP, he was an active supporter.
"you should vote for Trump", Joe Biden
I remember seeing assholes wishing rape on Michelle and the girls.  The girls weren't even 10 yet.  That was,  of course,  before the revolting attacks on Michelle for other things.
Well,  thank you very much,  I needed to sniffle on my phone again.  The way Joe whips out that hankie and turns his back reminds me so much of my own dad,  except to achieve true dadhood,  it should have been about the size of a bedspread.
There's a difference between working with people for a basic common objective like a tax code and loyally supporting an administration in which you will never be the primary policy maker, after losing a primary to said policy maker.  Another way to spin this would be that Biden gets as much done as he can even if it means working with unpleasant people or subordinating his own ambitions
It was an unfortunate gaffe. So what?
Please go back to the being divisive in the Sanders subs, dude/ette. The VP has no power.
Bitter much?

Jesse Jackson called New York “Hymietown”. Bernie’s support of him is just further evidence of his faults. Plus, Mondale was the most qualified candidate in 1984. In 1988, Dukakis lost, but we probably could have beaten Bush if we had nominated Al Gore or Dick Gephardt. Jackson never would have stood a chance.
You're reading it wrong. It's not saying the white man needs to learn his place under a black man, but that Biden did not let his own qualifications, pride, ego, age, or status get in the way of being loyal and humble serving under a much less qualified man who also was black. Not many white rich male politicians (or not politicians) can have that said about them.
Is it? I’m a white guy. There are aspects of the black experience I’ll never understand. For example, the cultural history of having white men constantly in positions of authority over you, sometimes to abusive effect. And to understand that such a power structure is derived from slavery, an act of complete and total humiliation, means existing power dynamics in today’s age can’t be explained away simply because slavery no longer exists.  For Joe to not only support Barack, but actively support him and be his ally in the most powerful position in the world, is quite frankly unprecedented in history. It shows joes heart is not rooted in the traditional power dynamics that have have abused black Americans for centuries.  There’s an element here me as a white male will never understand. But I can see what the author is stating, and I respect it.

Who would do that? Surely the new standard-bearer of the Democratic party!

This is why I feel more & more confident about supporting Joe. This comment & the one by u/di11deux show what it's like when supporters are willing to listen and respond without snark or insults.  I've asked a few people why they support Joe and it's not just his policy but a return to civility that ppl want and are missing from the current administration.
That’s what I call a low bar.

Trump literally referred to marchers who were shouting “You will not replace us, Jews will not replace us” as “Very fine people”.
Don't ya'll have like 25 other subs to go be toxic in? I mean, what's stopping Bernie from getting all that positive PR? Except he doesn't work within the party structure to promote progressives, constantly shit talks the party structure, and how's that Our Revolution going? Elect many Congressional or Senate candidates in the blue wave of 18? NOPE, basically struck out: https://ballotpedia.org/Our_Revolution. He didn't even endorse AOC in her primary! Maybe the "TEE VEE" crowd is a little savvier than you give them credit for and know what works in the real world.
Bernie was the only elected white guy to stand behind a black guy who happened to be a bigot and a jerk, who furthermore couldn’t have won an election. That doesn’t earn you points.

I mean Sanders supporters. And I’m not your personal Google concierge, you can look shit up yourself. Try starting here: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-kkk-klan-wizard/. Please parrot your Republican/Russian propaganda elsewhere.
Biden was a U.S. Senator. It was literally his job to maintain a working relationship with people he disagreed with. Is Obama a racist for working with Robert Byrd?  Martin Luther King, Jr. was a great American and a true hero. Jesse Jackson has made progress in important areas but has also expressed bigotry and driven wedges between people. I laud Jesse Jackson for the achievements that he has made but fighting against bigotry is not an excuse for your own bigotry. Also, the world would definately be a better place if Ralph Abernathy had assumed leadership of the civil rights movement instead of Jesse Jackson.

Sanders supporters being everything that I just listed above. Interesting how you'll gloss over that and then call me the Republican while your candidate vastly supports Republican policies. Good on you though for that gotcha! You're absolutely right, it wasn't a grand wizard that he shook hands with, just a high level kkk organizer. 😂 Meanwhile my candidate got locked up for actually protesting segregation. If that makes me Russian then Cyka Blyat. I'll wait for any gotchas against m4a, abolishing student loan debt, legalizing marijuana, legalizing abortion, and being ANTI iraq war. Take your time. We'll see if you come out supporting Bernie on the otherside, or if you'll continue to pretend your candidate is anything other than a republican.

Your precious Saint Bernie did one fucking march fifty seven years ago and ever since has expected black people to vote for his deadbeat dad ass.   &nbsp;  Meanwhile,  Robert Byrd renounced the Klan and became a fierce advocate of civil rights----so much so that the NAACP gave a eulogy for him.    &nbsp;   Now,  why are you LYING?
Joe Biden supports racial justice and has for decades. A long time ago, he opposed bussing, while still supporting the goal of desegregation. He had been in favor of bussing while running, and was caught of guard by a backlash to bussing in his state. he saw it as his job to represent the views of his constituents. Was it the best thing? No. Hundreds of black leaders have forgiven him for this, so bringing this up is pretty pointless. He is left of Obama politically. Obama picked him to have someone with more experience on the ticket, as well as to appeal to blue collar voters in the rust belt. Jesse Jackson made an extremely bigoted comment. I’m not saying that he hates all Jews, but the prejudice is there. Also, Bernie has been endorsed by scores of antisemites, so all that says is that they’re normal bigots who hold bigoted opinions, rather than complete extreme bigots who want to engage in a campaign of genocide. How many racists say “Well, not all of them”, after making a racist statement. The answer is a lot. That’s basically where Jesse Jackson is, as well as several other notable antisemites who support him, such as Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Linda Sarsour, and Cornell West.

Calling Israel an apartheid state is completely ridiculous, and reflects either ignorance, misunderstanding, or antisemitism. Besides, I didn’t list those people for that.
Latest poll of Florida primary shows Joe Biden with massive lead over Bernie Sanders; Biden 61%, Bloomberg 14%, Sanders 12%, Warren 5%
Top 4 | % ---|--- Biden | 61% Bloomberg | 14% Sanders | 12% Warren | 5%  Dates: Mar. 4, 2020  Spread: **Biden +47**  Biden is in first place at a whopping 61%; you didn't misread that. Everyone else is under the 15% threshold.  Look at the prior margins from this pollster:  * https://i.imgur.com/PXiV7Ah.png  Bloomberg +5 ➟ Biden +9 ➟ Biden +47  Edit:  *FiveThirtyEight lists the spread as: Biden +48. I'm not sure if they rounded the figures or not.*
Sanders chose to place himself below the 15% threshold by unapologetically praising that monster Castro.  This is why Bernie can't be the nominee.  It's the only way Democrats lose Florida in November.
FL has 219 pledged delegates.  Based on this it's completely realistic for Joe to gain a triple digit delegate margin from FL alone.
Florida has officially banned malarkey
And remember that is with Bloomberg still IN the race. We got this. 💎💎💎
I wonder if r/politics is going to cover this?
I can't wait for my state to end bernie
The "socialist" label is still very bad in Florida.
That is unreal. I know why but wow.
💎💎💎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Oh Castro.
This is what happens when a socialist praises a communist.
Imagine Biden getting all 219 delegates. With Warren likely to drop out soon, Bernie will probably get about 20% to Biden’s 75%. It’s going to be a fucking massive blow out
We’re in the endgame now
Sanders shit will not work in Florida with  a massive Cuban population. Their parents and grandparents lived thru Castro and this schmuck is going around praising him yeah good strategy there
I wouldn't be surprised if he gets over 75% between Bloomberg dropping out and Bernie supporters becoming discouraged
I’m a Bernie supporter but I’m also a drag Trump out of the White House and kick his clown ass to the curb supporter. If Biden can get people to come out and vote to carry Florida in the general in a way Hillary couldn’t, great! I’m sick of Republicans constantly winning in Florida.
Joe’s going to get every delegate out of Florida at this point
Florida is smart!
LIKE A DRUM
No malarkey here! 🥁
This is awesome, but don't take it for granted. We must keep looking ahead and continue doing everything we can to win these primaries.
YEAH BABY... You go Joe...
Where are the Castro ads tho??
If this happens the primary is over
So much for having the “Latino vote.” Praising Fidel Castro tends to have that effect.
I actually don’t hate Bernie I just don’t believe in the way he delivers his ideas and how he is not able to compromise.  That being said, I’m glad Biden is doing well.
Honestly are we surprised? The state with the highest Cuban population doesn't want to vote for somebody who likes Castro?
If Biden takes all delegates lol
That comment about Fidel Castro is going to kill him in the primary and the general.
Do you need to be a Democrat to vote in FL primary?
FL-01 in the house! Gonna vote for Biden and for Phil Ehr, the guy who I believe can defeat Matt Gaetz
yeah im not believing this horseshit lmao
If Joe wins the nomination, I am almost sure that he will take Florida over Trump.
lol so biden is going to get all 219 delegates
Don't take this poll too seriously. The polling agency, St Pete Polls, is rated as a C+ on FiveThirtyEight, meaning it might not be too accurate. Its impossible to deny that biden is beating sanders by a lot in Florida, but we already knew that. Don't take the specific percentage points too seriously.  Edit: This poll was also taken before bloomberg dropped out
Florida might just become what California was supposed to be for Biden!
Holy smokes, everything is coming up roses for Joe. Or should I say oranges? Even if this poll is an outlier in his favor. He figures to run roughshod over Bernie in the Sunshine State.  The only down note in this is that Warren dropping likely gets Bernie to viability statewide and a lot of congressional districts where he would not have had she stayed in. Assuming that the numbers in this poll are correct, and they’re all of course subject to margin of error and sample issues. But it’s a pretty safe bet that Warren dropping out will get Bernie to viability in some CDs where he would not have and possibly statewide.  End of the day, Florida might be the end of the day for the Bern. Sanders will not enjoy press interviews along the lines of, “you just got your butt handed to you on this peninsula, how are you feeling and what is your path forward?”
Then doubling down...  Then having a story come out where he pouted in the corner while visiting an American prisoner in Cuba and telling him that he doesn't understand why everyone thinks Cuba is so bad.
Absolutely moronic approach by Sanders but not all that surprising. His inability to win Florida, Penn, and Southern States means he's dead on arrival in the general.   Best thing Sanders can do is to drop out after getting beaten decisively by the end of March
I really hope this is the case but I hope we’re not in a position where we have to depend on Florida, especially since they “lost” thousands of votes between Gillum and DeSantis.
Anyone who knows anything about Florida politics (especially among Cuban Americans) will know that praising Castro might as well be resigning yourself to getting virtually no vote from that community. And considering that's where a majority of the population is in the state, that's a bad strategy, regardless of your actual views about Castro and Cuba.
I don’t want to be that guy, but I think it has more to do with the fact that Florida’s population is 21% 65+ years old and they don’t tend to view ‘socialism’ well in any sense. They also tend to vote far more heavily than young people. Castro praise certainty doesn’t help, but it’s not like he had much support amongst Cubans anyways.
Even before Biden became the front runner, this is why I became convinced we'd lose the general election if Bernie gets the nomination.  I've been through enough elections now to know just how huge Florida is in tipping the balance during the general election, and if Bernie polls poorly with the elderly and cubans that alone could blow our chances.
Florida is going to be a tough state even with Biden. Not sure why you think otherwise
Did you call him a monster? Dude,have you heard about his literacy program? Sure some people died, but I mean, all that communism!   In being service,since this is exactly what a Bernie bro would say...
Exactly. Huge mistake but it points to his mindset and values. It also points to being tone deaf about the feelings of his supporters. Whenever you bring this up to Bernie supporters they brush it away as not a big deal. SMH.
Honestly the Castro comments and Bernie Sanders' tripling down on them probably cost him the election. It wasn't just a guarantee he'd lose Florida but he made them right after Nevada when he became frontrunner. He signalled to the whole party he won't dial it back in the election and he would cost countless house, senate, and state seats. It helped push Pete and Amy into realizing the time was up and it probably helped Clyburn put his foot down considering his mentioning of McGovern when discussing his endorsement choice.
We will lose Florida no matter who the nominee is. Florida's elections are clearly corrupt and undemocratic. See what happened to those "lost" votes during the midterms. Bernie just made it worse with his comments.
That would mean a 160-59 delegate split for Joe and Bernie, meaning roughly a 73% vs 27% split. I don’t really see that happening. But a big lead could definitely be gained.
There are malarkey inspection stations at the border.
“Florida doesn’t matter...probably going to be won by Trump anyway.”
I saw someone on their making fun of him for exciting older voters as if older votes matter less or something
Florida man saves America
I cant wait either. Its going to be some good theater
Thanks!
The "pro-Castro" label is still very bad in Florida.   FTFY
Why hasn't the Socialist establishment come out for Sanders yet??   RIGGED!!!!
Lol ikr
Joe is definitely the nominee at this point. It's just a matter of whether or not he will break the delegate threshold for a decisive victory. Sanders supporters are basically denying the inevitable at this point.
With those numbers, Sanders would get 16 of the 76 delegates that are awarded statewide.  The other 143 are awarded by Congressional Districts. I’m pretty sure that most of Sanders support would be concentrated in the major population areas (Orlando, Tampa, Miami). So that means that he’ll probably not even reach viability in many congressional districts meaning that Biden will take all those delegates.

Not to get your hopes up but the vote count in California is probably only halfway counted.   [Nate Cohn:](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1235321328384827393)  >Be patient in California. It's possible that we're only now up around half of the vote counted. And that patience goes both ways: things could go much better for either Sanders or Biden from here; we just don't know until we see more of this late mail vote  The best outcome (aside from any sort of win) is that Sander's margin in California narrows so the delegates are more evenly split while Joe racks up the delegates elsewhere in other primaries. We may not know the official result for several weeks. The canvass period ends on April 3, 2020. However, daily vote counts should be coming in each afternoon and we'll get an idea of how things look like.
Warren dropping out might not be as favourable to Sanders as many think. Looking at who her voters are then they might just as well vote for Biden.

Win or lose, Bernie will hang on until the convention, waging a bitter scorched earth campaign, taking cheap potshots at Biden and radicalizing his supporters.  This is his last election. He's got nothing to lose.
Florida restored convicted felon voting rights.  That's 1.4M more eligible voters since last election.  Not only that, but demographics have shifted more liberal.
Nah, Florida is dead to me. I call it Red. The path in the general is PA is a must win and then we must take 2 of 3 of the swing States of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona.   My hope is AZ is leaning blue after Krysten's win and a strong Mark Kelly run. Leaving us to just really deal with MI and WI.   On a sidenote, even though NC is historically a swing state, there is too many Republican shenanigans and voter suppression to think we will grab it so I can it Red.
Florida is not as yuge as it once was. The current electoral makeup that began with Obama has allowed a lot more wiggle room for a Democrat to win, unlike a Republican.
1.4M people got their voting rights restored, and demographics have shifted with the massive migration to Florida.  However, having Bernie praise a monstrous dictator many Floridians escaped didn't help.
It will be, yes. But Biden has a solid shot at winning it, Bernie has none.
There was a period when Castro would kill people by [bleeding them dry and selling the blood products to Vietnam](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113590852154334404).  Monster might be kind, but Bernie thinks he deserves praise.
Bernie's comments will not have a real effect on Biden's chances in a general election there.
Bernie reaching as high as 27% is a longshot if this polling holds up.  Even if he takes all the Warren voters (he won't) and all the undecided voters (he won't), he needs Bloomberg-to-Bernie voters (lol) to even reach 27%.  There is a debate and two weeks of campaigning between then and now and things could certainly change, but Bernie being held to 27% or less is certainly not unrealistic given this poll.
You don’t see that happening??? Bernie would be LUCKY to get those numbers. Are you even reading this poll? Most all of Bloomberg’s vote would go to Biden, giving him around 75% right there. Even if we give all of Warren’s to Bernie, he would be under 20%.   I think it is plausible that Joe surpasses 80% and Bernie doesn’t even reach viability. I am dead serious. 73-27 would be in the better range of outcomes for Bernie. There is no state imaginable worse for him demographically.
The coast guard has redirected funding from cracking down on narcotic smugglings to malarky.
At least Biden has a better shot of winning it in the general
“Lol. Who needs older voters, they can’t make memes and they aren’t in r/SandersforPresident or r/Sandersforpresident2.”
Bernie Sanders won't talk about black voters. His excuse is they're "establishment." It's really disgusting.
Come on. This isn't even disingenuous, it's straight up dishonest.   We're better than to spread clear lies about the other candidates.   While I didn't agree fully with him talking about Castro in a positive light it was clear he was only talking about Castro's literacy initiative. He clearly said that Castro was mostly wrong but even in the worst regimes they sometimes get something right.   Which is true, but maybe we avoid even bringing up dudes like Castro.   But to say he's pro-Castro is just dishonest and we're better than that
Wdym dude Kyle Kulinski said its 50/50 now
I believe he will. After Tuesday, it seems unlikely that Biden won’t reach the majority.
She just ended her campaign.
I’d love her forever.
Yes, that Gaetz, literally the worst rep in the HoR
Biden wasn't even supposed to reach viability in California
The west is pretty much Bernie territory. The population of this region is disproportionately young, urban, and white. (Except for CA, AZ, and NM). We do have to prepare for the fact that Bernie might win all the Western states.   However, most of the western states have small populations except for California. California was supposed to be Bernie’s goldmine, but he has few other places to turn after that. Sanders could win Washington, Oregon, and maybe Arizona, but Biden is favored in Florida, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania. These states have far more delegates than the western states do.
Shouldn‘t Biden do better in California as more and more votes are counted? Early voters favoured Sanders while Biden gained ground with late voters.
Yeah, I think most that were going to go to Bernie already abandoned her before Super Tuesday. The remaining Warren voters are pragmatic, college educated voters in their 30s and 40s who don't really want a revolution. I had planned to canvas for Warren here in Florida no matter her chances of winning the nomination but now that she's dropped out I'm 100% behind Biden.
I've been surfing the various Bernie subs and I've seen far more Warren supporters coming to this sub alone than I have seen in the totality of all the different pro-Bernie subs. Granted, that is not a representative sample of the country, but I still thought it was noteworthy.
That’s true, but it will still likely get Sanders delegates in a Florida primary that could have been a sweep.
It doesn’t have to be hugely favorable. If it takes him from 12 or 13 to 16 or 17, he’s viable. Joe might conceivably get more of her votes but lose delegates on balance b/c Sanders hits 15+ in a lot of places.
He was imprisoned for trying to bring more internet access to Cuba, and during his imprisonment he lost 100 pounds, 5 teeth, and was horribly mistreated. The US had to trade 3 convicted spies for him.  ...But, their literacy rate was fantastic, so you know, you have to take the good with the bad.
>> [in 2014].  >That event happened 6 years ago, too.  Wow. Just wow. He really got the kid gloves in 2016.
Alan Gross was imprisoned for being a CIA spy. As per his [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Gross?wprov=sfla1),  >However, he went to Cuba for a fifth time in late November 2009 and was arrested 11 days later. When he was arrested, he was carrying a high-tech chip, intended to keep satellite phone transmissions from being located within 250 miles (400 kilometres). The chip is not available on the open market. It is provided most frequently to the CIA and the United States Department of Defense, but can also be obtained by the United States Department of State, which oversees USAID.  This is literally an endorsement from the CIA.
If he does his entire legacy will be that of a spoiler sore loser
> This is his last election. He's got nothing to lose.  I'm not sure about that. He didn't drop out after his heart attack this fall and he doesn't seem to have learned his lesson on things. The primary really should have ended up as Warren vs Biden. I wouldn't bet on it but I also wouldn't be surprised if Bernie runs in 2024.
To Team Pete, Team Amy, and Team Beto: Tonight is your win, too. #TeamJoe is lucky to have you.
LONG LIVE THE COALITION
I was Team Pete from the beginning and I voted for Biden today in Texas. It actually hurt a little not to be able to vote for him but Joe needed my support, it’s a tight race.
I'm a Warren voter, and I just got here, but this seems like a nice sub. I want to read good things about Joe so I can get as excited as you all will when he beats Trump in November. :)
Man I love that I feel like I have a new home after Pete dropped
Pete supporter, but Biden was always my second choice. Glad to be a part of the team and was so touched by Joe’s really kind words towards Pete.
I must be extra emotional tonight because going through this subreddit has made me cry a few times. I’m still heartbroken over Pete, but it’s so good to know that Joe’s campaign and here, in particular, are so welcoming. From the Pete appreciation thread to the adoption of the RotR ... thank you. My state is mail-in and my type A self submitted my ballot for Pete on the day I got it, so I’ll have to help Team Joe win the era by text banking and donating instead.   Thank you, thank you, thank you ♥️
Tonight (almost) makes losing the chance to vote for Pete worth it. My heart still aches, but it's a hell of a lot more full than it was before.
Pete supporter here... Donated to the Biden campaign twice today.  Let's do this! What a night!
Former Right side / Yang supporter. I’m onboard.
I was heartbroken when Pete dropped out. Tonight made it me feel better about the decision. Thank you for extending the feeling and gratitude. It means a lot.
Thank you. As a former Pete supporter who literally cried when Pete dropped out, this makes me confident that I am making the right choice by going all in on Biden.  Look, we're all close enough on policy preferences. The real part that matters is supporting a candidate who will be a true leader and unifier that has a heart, and is going to do everything in his power to accomplish what is right and just. Joe is clearly that person.  💎LET'S💎GO💎DIAMOND💎JOE💎
Not me us   Amy hit Bernie with dracarys in Minnesota
Team Jeto Buttichar!
Joe is a team player. You can’t always get your first choice but being part of the team is good enough for me.
From this rock-solid, year-long, Pete supporter, yes, Joe is damn lucky.  It’s still a little bittersweet, though, for some of us, but good to see that the vitriol of the Sanders extremists is not being rewarded.
Heck yeah, those endorsements really helped to pull people toward Biden.  It was history in the making.
As someone who was originally team Beto, went to team Pete, thank you for the warm welcome. Let’s get Joe to the finish line and win this election
Recall Romney's explanation of why he voted to impeach, and how he would be but a footnote in history. If Biden wins, then Buttigieg, Klobuchar, O'Rourke, along with those like Clyburn, may be but footnotes in history, but well-deserved ones for possibly having saved not only the Republic and the Union, but the rest of the world as well.
Love you all.   Also Joe, you are going to need to bring more pizzas for your volunteers this time around.
We love you too and are so thankful for a welcoming group that is opposed to any divisiveness.
THIS is Unity
Thank you so much for the warm welcome!  Team Pete supporter here feeling extremely lucky to have a campaign with such kindness and positivity to support.
Pete supporter here. My heart isn’t fully behind Joe yet, but I donated a $20.20 after watching Pete’s instragram with Joe. I appreciate the inclusive attitude from Joe’s campaign - the same attitude that made Pete’s campaign feel like home. I’m happy for you all tonight!
Pete supporter. I might not be 100% in line with Joe politically, but we're glad to be here and proud to be a part of this team we've all built. We should be damn proud of what everybody's accomplished tonight. What a turnaround for \*all\* our campaigns.
This is what leadership looks like.
Yes, thank you guys. Amy, Pete's and Beto's choices will never go unnoticed.  It's been awesome and thank you all.   Even Tom supporters! Thank you.
This coalition is giving me so much hope. I’ve been so dejected by the polarization but ❤️
I am so happy that Team Beto is getting proper recognition.
Former Team Beto here. Glad to support Team Joe now
 Pete supporter here. You’re welcome!
The Era is all in for Team Joe
Diehard Pete supporter here but my husband always supported Joe and was hoping for a Joe & Pete combination in the future.  So here is to a PB & J.  I sent my first contribution to Joe with love from Pete.
Awww shucks!
And my axe!
This is the unity movement.
Team Beto is on the Biden Train!  Get in y’all, we’re going to the White House!
We all do better, when we all do better.   Lets get the damn Senate.
THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS! Joe legit couldnt have done it without everyone, this campaign is home to ALL democrats
When we unite, we win.
Thank Beto  Thank you Pete  and THANK YOU AMY -
Betomania is behind Biden!
It's just a change coming from team Pete, where it felt like every candidates supporters were dumping on us to suddenly feel welcome and validated.
"To Team Pete, Team Amy, and Team Beto: Tonight is your win, too. #TeamJoe is lucky to have you. "                   >Tweet publisher: TeamJoe
I won’t be able to enthusiastically support any other candidate as much as I did with Pete, but this election for me has always been about who I think will defeat trump, not my personal preferences. I believe Biden can do that. He may not be my favorite candidate ever but we can’t afford to have high standards this time around. Like I’ve been saying, we gotta vote like Republicans to beat them, and their standards are 💩
I am liking this coalition politics.  I am liking it a lot.
This is so wholesome. <3
Cory where are yoooooou   Cory get in here, all your friends are here   Cory we want you, we're saving you a seat
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Pure class.
Thank you all for joining us!!
Wife and I are his glad to see it's paying off!
Getting all those names right is a victory in itself!
Thank you! I for one am damn glad to be here.
USA! USA! USA! USA!
What about Team Yang? :(
Truly, I liked all three of those candidates as well some others.
Yes the unity that has occurred in the past few days has truly been wonderful. Biden wasn't doing hot at the beginning, but now things are turning around with all the cooperation.
In the coming weeks my home state of NY will be a very important one to win. I am a 41 year old man, who struggles mightily on Long Island. I have 2 kids and me and my wife have a very difficult life. I work 10 hour days and my wife works overnights bc if we had to pay for child care we would not be able to afford a roof over our heads. I am a Bernie Sanders supporter and if Biden wins the primary I am considering sitting the election out completely. I understand that the DNC wants Biden because they feel Bernie may not get the moderates and you need them to win, and to the Bernie supporters your response to us is "hey, he isn't Trump".  However I think this misses a huge point, and that is that Biden certainly can't beat Trump without Sanders supporters voting for him.   For most Sanders supporters it's not just about beating Trump, it's also about the change that needs to happen that Bernie offers and Biden seems unaware of. So I'm the coming weeks it will rest on this campaign to win over the Sanders crowd. So my question to you is how do you address these concerns:  1) Biden does not support national healthcare or even affordable healthcare. He will follow a system that has failed many Americans and left millions of children and adults with no or inadequate healthcare that had lead to unnecessary death of kids and cancer patients who simply can't afford to see a doctor or obtain proper treatment.   2) Biden has received incredible amounts of money from the mega rich, which means this campaign will owe those people and his policies will much more closely reflect their interests and not mine and my families, who are being crippled by unchecked capitalism.  3) Biden supports and will implement more failed policy. He will give enormous tax breaks to my employer who will not increase my salary, he will give breaks to insurance companies that will raise my premiums, and breaks to the billionaire who owns my apartment complex who will intern raise my rent.   I, apparently, am not "American enough" to have my concerns addressed. So my wife and I will continue to struggle, never go on vacation, have weeks where we have to decide weather we should pay rent on time or buy food for our children. What is this campaigns response to these questions? Why should I support this campaign int the primary and not Bernie Sanders?  Furthermore, I'm asking why I, and millions of other Sanders supporters, should come out and support Joe Biden, in the event he does win the nomination? Make no mistake, if the Sanders crowd sits out the election vs Trump you will lose!!!! So can you tell me why we shouldn't?   And can you do it without saying "well he isn't Trump"  Sincerely, a concerned citizen, who capitalism is leaving behind

I would rather vote trump than Joe. The DNC pushed a candidate of their own, again! Baby boomers once again not listening, out of touch with the base. Joe the one candidate that offers no change to the establishment, and who’s views are outdated. And if you think I’m the only who thinks this way all I have to say is don’t be surprised if he looses. Cuz a lot of us ain’t getting out of the couch for Joe.

Eventually we will somehow need to do the impossible and bring Bernie into the coalition for the general....   To defeat Trump we must unite
JOEalition
Good job with Texas tho.
Hey! Welcome. You're in great company, I'm new here too (came over from Pete) but these folks are good people.
Senator Warren is the patriotic hero we deserve after she left Bloomberg all but drowning on dry land in the debates!
Love to you and to Warren.  She's a great Democrat and I sympathize with her fans' frustration right now.  I hope that, if nothing else, the prominence her run is giving her will make her the superstar of the Senate.
You're always welcome here!
It's pretty satisfying seeing Bernies "electability" argument completely destroyed. Biden won states where he didn't even campaign.
I think Yang is going to figure very prominently in American politics for years to come. He really impressed me.
We are voting for Pete's place in Joe's future administration as well. This is still something we can do to support Pete.
Loved Pete as well, chances are slim but I’d love to see him as a VP. But if no, somewhere as a representative for our country. Sec. of State ?
It turned the tide.  So proud of Pete.
not to be snarky, but I do feel obligated to point out that Pete's already guaranteed he will never be a footnote in history. He's a trailblazer for LGBT candidates for the next several generations.
Anyone else see Romney endorsing Joe and flipping Utah at the last minute against Trump?
Same! #TeamJoe has been awesome to us refugees. I'm glad we weren't in the wild very long, and I'm more glad we found a home here.
SAME!
Rules of the road baby!
yeah rather have a president i agree with 90% with one that i hardly agree with
You're welcome.
Yes, I agree! There was so much polarization before and I really did not like how the campaign season was making so many allies dislike each other. It feels therapeutic to be joining together.
Pete was my first with a tie between Amy and Joe for second, with both Pete and Amy out time for Team Joe!
This right here.  Unity is what will do it. It's what the Republicans wish they could have done to stop Trump in 2016, but couldn't.
Yeah, I'm honestly sad that we'll never get to see Pete run directly against Trump. He would have campaigned circles around that tired old shitbag, and it would have been a glorious sight.   But Biden is no slouch, and he's building an amazing team, so I'm hopeful.
We love Yang too but afaik he hadn't endorsed Biden yet
The "mega rich" continue to have the same donation cap as everyone else, and frankly that talking point is getting exhausting.
1.  Biden supports affordable healthcare.  It's literally verbatim in his plan.  I encourage you to check it out:  [https://joebiden.com/healthcare/](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)  Some of the highlights are caps on insurance premiums, eliminate surprise billing (super important for ER visits), external reference pricing for drugs (using foreign drug prices as benchmarks for our pricing).  Is he going to make it free? no he isn't.  But the idea that it won't be significantly more affordable is a simple lie spread by fake news Bernie Bros on Twitter and Reddit.  2.  There are two ways to interpret your second point.  The first is that Biden trades policies for money.  Just like all other candidates, there is a $2800 limit on donations.  If you add up all the money donated from rich people, it makes up a tiny fraction of his funding.  Frankly, you get elected not because of money, but because of votes.  I think Bloomberg proved that.  Biden's voting base is overwhelmingly working class.  If anything, his policies reflect that.    The second way to interpret your point is that because billionaires have donated, his policies align with their views and their views aren't good for America.  I think that argument takes for granted that billionaires don't donate and vote with their hearts.  Further, it takes for granted that a billionaire's preferred policies are detrimental to America, which I would argue isn't true because there are tons of billionaires and a lot of them have great policy preferences (Tom Steyer for example).  Finally, the third point to make is that Sanders has received donations from billionaires because SOME billionaires like his policies.  His campaign has a policy of returning the donation so that Bernie can make this purity test.  The fact that Bernie returns money from billionaires further goes to show my point that voters are what matters, not donations.  3. Biden is for raising taxes and reversing the Trump tax cuts; he does not support tax cuts for corporations.  His healthcare plan actually EXPANDS regulation on insurers to cover more costs on more procedures.  He simply doesn't want to give tax breaks to billionaires.  Frankly, the reason you should vote for Biden if he wins is because his policies are good for America.  I encourage you to get your information from the primary source: his campaign at  [https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/)   It simply makes no sense to trust secondary sources like Twitter, r/politics, or the intercept when you have the actual primary source material at your fingertips.
> I understand that the DNC wants Biden  It's not "the DNC", it's "the majority of voters in the democratic party".   > Biden does not support national healthcare or even affordable healthcare.  Biden supports universal healthcare. Universal healthcare is the goal, M4A is one proposal to reach that goal. Biden supports ending "surprise billing" where you go to an in network but then lab work or something else is done out of network without you knowing it and you get a "surprise" OON bill. He's going to allow importing prescription drugs from other countries to get the costs down. He is going to get a public option and subsidies for people who can't afford it. He is going to reempower Medicare to negotiate on more fronts that they were prohibited after Part D passed.   What he won't do thankfully, is impose a federally run program on people who have insurance they want to keep and I'll tell you why that's good. Advocates for M4A point to countries like Canada as an example of a great working single payer system. But Canada doesn't have a large and politically active religious right like we have in the US. Those people don't want people to get abortions, IVF, birth control, the HPV vaccine for teen girls which has been shown to reduce cancer rates, they don't want people who are trans to be able to transition, and they often want to be able to send gay children to "conversion camp" to be "cured" through what amounts to torture. After 2016, Trump, McConnel, and Ryan were running the federal government. DO you want the federal government deciding what they will and will not pay for the next time people like that are running the government? I'm actually amazed the religious right isn't in favor of M4A because with the Hyde amendment already law, it would mean the end of abortion in this country, and could mean the end of many things that they also are against.   M4A advocates point to Canada, but the public option works very well in countries like Germany and the Netherlands. SO don't tell me that a public option won't work when it, like single payer, works in other countries. It will get us universal healthcare, bring costs down, and not force people who want to keep their current plan to vote for trump to save their healthcare.   Also, Sanders goes farther than other countries. He's saying he will abolish private insurance. Few, if ANY, countries have that. Canada has private insurance, as does Britain, as do Americans currently on Medicare. Canada doesn't cover dental or vision, but Sanders is saying it will. Which maybe it will, but he has to explain how he will fund it, and he's not even trying to with any specificity.  > Biden has received incredible amounts of money from the mega rich, which means this campaign will owe those people and his policies will much more closely reflect their interests and not mine and my families, who are being crippled by unchecked capitalism.  That's simply not true. And in any case, Biden is proposing a Constitutional Ammendment to undo the Citizens United Case, a proposal which may be the most important legislation in 2020 to preserve a real democracy. He wants to have elections publicly funded. He is supporting policies that get the money OUT of politics and stops the super rich from having undue influence in politics.   > Biden supports and will implement more failed policy. He will give enormous tax breaks to my employer who will not increase my salary, he will give breaks to insurance companies that will raise my premiums, and breaks to the billionaire who owns my apartment complex who will intern raise my rent.   This is so vague I'm not sure what you are referring to, but Biden is going to raise taxes on the wealthiest people. He's going to end the Trump tax cuts that have exploded the deficit, and more.  From his page, here's his plan on supporting union:  https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/  Here's some plans in a broader scope to help the middle class including supporting unions, infrastructure spending, developing underdeveloped areas, fight climate change and get to 100% clean energy, grants for start up businesses, and reinvest in economically depressed cities:  https://joebiden.com/infrastructure/  > I, apparently, am not "American enough" to have my concerns addressed.   What has Biden ever said to give you that impression?  > Why should I support this campaign int the primary and not Bernie Sanders?  Well, no one can tell you who to support. I hope the info I've given you persuades you, but if it doesn't by all means follow your judgement and support Sanders in the primary. But don't sit out the general no matter what. If Biden is the nominee, you will not be forgotten. Biden knows what you're going through. As a child his family had to leave Scranton PA so his father could find work. It's a bit of a cliche at this point but it's the truth: Biden has lived economic hardship just like you're living now. He gets it, he's lived it. He won't leave you behind. If you consider the candidates and their proposals and decide on Sanders over Biden, I respect your choice. But if the election comes down to Biden vs Trump, there's a clear choice: Biden will help you, Trump will not. Trump knows NOTHING about the hardships your family is experiencing. Biden does.   > Make no mistake, if the Sanders crowd sits out the election vs Trump you will lose!!!! So can you tell me why we shouldn't?   Because you will lose, too. If it's Biden vs Trump in November, and Trump wins, you and I will both lose. Trump winning isn't going to do a single thing to improve your life. All it will do is give you  sense of revenge against people who have a different plan to help you and help this country. Sanders supporters already sat out in large enough numbers to give us Trump, as well as Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as lifetime SCOTUS justice. Don't make that mistake again.   > And can you do it without saying "well he isn't Trump"  Yes, for all the policy positions I've given above. But the fact is in November it will come down to Trump or the Democratic nominee. And if the nominee is Biden, then Biden is the clear choice.   I don't think you really want 4 more years of the incompetence, the corruption, the tax cuts to the richest and nothing for the middle class, the juvenile nicknames, the chipping away at workers rights. I think you feel like I felt after NH, angry and disillusioned. I've since cooled off and was prepared to vote for Sanders over Trump even though I disagree with many of his policies and rhetoric. I think once you've had time to cool off you'll realize that Biden might not be your first choice, but if it is Trump vs Biden, you'll realize Biden is the right choice. Not Trump, not sitting out, not writing in "FDR."   I hope this was helpful to you, and I applaud you reaching out and having this dialogue with us.
> 1) Biden does not support national healthcare or even affordable healthcare  The number of uninsured under ACA dropped in half, Biden was a part of that. That's 10s of millions of people, and Biden wants to expand it. This is far more than Bernie has done or will ever, you need to get off the pro Bernie subs.  > Biden has received incredible amounts of money from the mega rich  Biden didn't have have ads in several states last night and almost zero field offices in California. He doesn't have "incredible amounts" of money, he has no amounts.  > He will give enormous tax breaks to my employer who will not increase my salary,   This isn't anywhere in any of his proposals.
1) Biden’s healthcare plan is aimed at making it more affordable. Strengthening Obamacare, expanding on subsidies, setting a lower cap on expenses, and allowing people to switch to a public option are all part of his plan. Our current insurance policies have either not been able to fully go into effect, or have been attacked by Republicans. Obamacare can work, it just needs support from policy makers.   2) like the other commenter said, wealthy donors have the same cap, and while Biden doesn’t have the same fundraising prowess as Sanders, he still collects significant small dollar donations.   3) Biden wants to repeal the trump tax cuts, and tax capital gains at the same rate as income. That means that wealthy people and corporations will pay more. There’s no need to put words in a candidates mouth as to what their policies are.   And finally, even if you don’t think that Biden will help you as much as Sanders will, Trump will absolutely not help your living situation. Biden genuinely cares about doing the right thing and helping people. Trump is obviously only in it for his own power, and is doing everything he can to screw over the working and middle classes. I don’t want to sound like Biden is the lesser of two evils, because he’s actually a good candidate, but if you still don’t like him, just remember that trump is absolutely worse. Bernie voters need to get on board if Biden is the nominee, else we suffer under another 4 years of chaos.
We vote though.😉
Only like 6k of us (and that's like double what it used to be). But surprise, it's almost like reddit isn't real life.
> I can't have exactly what I want, so everyone else should suffer now.
Hey, I'm sorry you've gotten that impression - can I correct a couple misunderstandings?  - The people who picked Joe are not the DNC, but old black ladies.  They *are* the base and they chose Joe.  I wanted Pete so badly it hurt, but most of them chose Joe instead.  Oh well.  We can't win without them and we shouldn't try, so Pete deferred to their choice.  And Joe's response was to welcome Pete people into a genuine coalition where we have real voices.  - As for "outdated views", I hope you'll look at [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/fda3d9/joes_policies_in_a_simple_list/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and see some things that are more appealing than Trump and more appealing than your couch.  And if you want still more progressive policies - okay!  Get a Senate that will pass them!  Because neither Bernie nor Joe can pass *anything at all* without the Senate, and neither of them will veto a bill that a Democratic Senate does pass, whether it's more progressive or less than they would have chosen.  At least you do understand that the consequence of your (current) stance, if enough others follow, is a Trump re-election.  Keep in mind, if that happens, there will be no meaningful 2024 election to try again.  The voter suppression that we've seen so far will be peanuts compared to what the Republicans will launch with a fully docile and obedient court "supervising" them.  This is it.  You can help destroy American democracy forever out of spite if you really want, if you want that to be your generation's legacy.
We are all flipped upside down from Trump and we just want to recover from that.  I'm sorry that it's not a good time for your silly revolution.  Maybe Bernie can go back to Russia for a second honeymoon and make some more connections for  a 2024 run.
you do realize that biden thinks that mandatory minimum reform sentences for non violent drug crimes should be eliminated
Yes we should probably start preparing for this, as there is a lot of I'll will.
I think Joe's VP pick will do a lot of the heavy lifting bringing the Progressive (and possibly Left) wing sides around to Joe. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a progressive endorsed Joe...so it's very much doable. This is honestly gonna be an amazing coalition.
Holy Hell Guys The 18 - 29 Group Did Show Up To Vote...For Biden!
I'm one of them! Proud Biden voter here in San Diego.   Edit: I'm 19F, and several of my uni classmates also voted for Biden! Let's change the narrative that only older folks support him - he has a broad coalition with many different backgrounds.
That's me
Look at that diversity and energy, now that's good stuff.
Biden vs Sanders is like Steady vs Blow Shit Up. Sorry, but I just took 4 years of blow shit up and I want to go on with my life without worrying about the president. I loved obama because I didn’t have to pay attention.
I'm youngish and voted Biden. I don't post about it on social media, but there's a good amount of moderates around you don't see openly
I’m one!
I genuinely did not expect this. I am 30, and I don't really know many people in their early or mid twenties. I figured from YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit that there were hardly any Biden supporters among them. This just further proves that the internet is not reality.  Holy smokes.
This has to be the greatest political comeback that I've seen in presidential politics.  Biden was left for dead a week ago, yet here we are.  His support has been surprising loyal throughout this year despite all of the incredible headwinds he's faced.  Focus on getting this nomination, consolidating the party, and beating Trump in November.  I've been with you, and the wife and I VOTE!  Thanks for being a decent human being.
26 here, can’t wait to vote for Joe in the general next
Look diversity!
28 here.
So basically Bernie's got that 12-15 year old demo on lock. That explains a ton.
Oh no, I'm old now.
21 year old Californian for Biden here!
I’m 36 and I’m so proud, which in turn is making me feel old.
What a great picture
Late 20s, have volunteered for enough campaigns my local chapter gave me an award, have met the DNC chair and vice chair, have ushered for Obama and Biden. We're here and we're ready. Signed up for a virtual volunteer orientation for Biden on Friday. I want him to win this outright so Sanders supporters can't fuss!
Zoomers for Biden!
Achievement Hunter represent!
I am 30 and feel so excluded.  Was going to vote for Biden in the primary back in '08, but he dropped before it got to Illinois (so I voted for Obama instead).  Looking forward to finally casting that vote 12 years later!
Because we fucking hate Trump and Bernie feels like the trump of the left. This current administration has gotten nothing done and tanked everything. I don’t want 4 more years of that.
This picture qualifies as accidental renaissance
18 and ridin with Biden when Kansas votes
I’m not old enough to vote for Biden in the PA primary, but i’ve been campaigning nonstop for him both directly with the campaign and indirectly trying to gain him support among my friends and family. I’ve also donated, rep biden gear, and will be ecstatic to vote for him in the general.
This is very true, I think a lot of us did it for Pete or because of Pete or because we knew the image of Pete's campaign lives on through Biden's.
My gf and I are both 29! We voted for Biden in CA!
25, white dude from Atlanta. My first ever vote was for Obama. I was so excited about it. Felt that same excitement when I early voted on Monday for Joe. Name a more iconic duo.
I know I did
Plan to be one!
under 18 gang😎
I am genuinely curious as to how many of those are from Pete's camp.   My running theory has been that a younger candidate would attract younger voters, and with Pete having dropped out, I never got to actually find out whether or not it's true. Would those of you who showed up to vote for Joe mind indulging me?
New subscriber, and proud to say that #ImWithJoe (You know where my heart was back in 2016)  Can I just say how the “establishment” narrative pisses me off. NO. Voters deserve better. Biden won super Tuesday because the Voters showed up for him.  American voters deserve better. They don’t deserve to be treated as if they don’t have minds of their own and can be manipulated by the “establishment” and the “mainstream media”. Just no.  Biden won Super Tuesday because Voters believed in his cause, not because they were told to do so.  Super Tuesday was a wake up call to never, NEVER, underestimate the moderate vote.
Joe needs to pick Yang as VP and he would have even more youth votes turn out. Especially if Joe took up UBI as his platform. He already knows about the fourth industrial revolution.  Joe would solidify his run by adding Andrew Yang to his campaign. Bernie wouldn't stand a chance and Trump wouldn't either.  Biden/Yang2020
Once they die of old age then finally Bernie will have a chance.
I'm 29 for a fee more months and I'll be boring for Joe on Tuesday
Holy crap! I still count in this group for a few months!
Things I didn't expect to see in a Biden campaign photo: Achievement Hunter pride shirt I literally own personally
18 and voted for Biden in CO! Sad that we couldn’t win my home state but knowing that other people across the country share my enthusiasm for Joe is encouraging. Love this campaign and am looking forward to the Biden presidency!
Surprised he's not groping any of the girls. Guess they're too old.
I would've voted for him if I knew my candidate was going to drop out. 25F. 😭
This is bidens entire voting base in 1 photo?
I'm 22. Also voted for Biden in San Diego!
24 in Boston!!
18 in CA!
25M from Virginia! Proud to be a part of his first big win of the night!
20M, not allowed to vote. Fok.
26F in the Bay Area!
19 yrs old in Seattle!
29 here In VA, my siblings voted for him as well
21/Sacramento!
What’s the most important policy you like about Biden in your opinion?
We exist!!
Yeah must be fake. I've been told Biden supporters are only unenergized old people who relunctantly vote for him just because they think he's electable. /s
I agree, the country is seeking stability, not a revolution.
and me!
There might be a “silent plurality” effect going on. I’m in my early 20’s, and the vast majority of political posts I see are either for Bernie or Trump. It seems to me that a silent plurality (or possibly a silent majority) of people actually want someone in between the guy who promises free stuff with no plan to pay for it and the guy who puts kids in cages.
I’m 35 and I’ve had to be absolutely silent on social media about my support for Pete, and now Biden,  because otherwise I get eaten alive and harassed by Bernie supporters.  There are a lot of younger people out there that do not want an angry revolution and instead prefer a stable, inclusive administration.
Same we exist, we are just more likely to take action than to complain about it.      Off topic but this is a very strange angle to take a photo from, just seems off.
We were all in on Butti, Klob, Yang and Beto fam.
To be fair there's only like 50 people in that picture so not quite proof but yeah twitter and reddit's demographic is not just young. It's young, male, big city, and white. Combine that with Russian bots and a rabid group of Bernie trolls that discourage dissent and it's an awful guage on who is actually out there. Won't stop people from saying "how could Biden win. I don't know anyone in my young, white, progressive bubble who supports Biden. DNC"
>This just further proves that the internet is not reality. Holy smokes.   That's a big one, yes. And I have to admit, I wonder if there's a Prop 8 style polling effect showing up in Sanders' numbers here. In 2008, polling in California showed wide opposition to this amendment banning same-sex marriage, buy the actual vote had it pass. The expected reason for this disparity is that opposition was the socially acceptable stance, so when asked people would announce they opposed it but voted for it at the polls.  Today, in a few social groups, the loudest members have created the impression that support for Sanders is the mainstream opinion, so you might be seeing inflated numbers for him because of this. On polling day, his proclaimed supporters are showing lower turnout and excuses I've seen include being unable to make it or a lack of faith that the system will actually do right by them. These may be true... But they're also socially acceptable excuses, to a degree, for why someone couldn't go vote for somebody they weren't really as keen for as they proclaimed.
I think 2 things sealed the deal for him. 1. His huge win in SC (gotta love that Joe-mentum) 2. Pete's endorsement (and Amy's) if you had asked me Saturday or Sunday before Pete dropped out, I was voting for Pete, no doubt.
Especially for Iowa!
Lol love your username
Came here for this
That's amazing!! PA will be crucial come November. Thanks and keep up the good work!!
Pete actually did better among older voters than younger voters, so I don't know that it'd be a "true" case to prove or disprove your theory. An explanation I saw once was that he's basically the boomer ideal of what a millennial should be (not saying that as a bad thing).
YangGang here. Absolutely would love that pick but not holding my breath. Guessing Kamala will be the nom. Though I suspect that the Biden administration would tap him for some position.
21/Orange County!
26 in San Diego too!

Why not?
I like that he's supporting Bobby Scott's SAFE act
Indeed! Gotta thank Pete tho. Wouldn’t if it wasn’t for his endorsement.
I don’t want to get in the middle of it, I just want to say hi slimjim
Going bankrupt because of broken arm is not stability.
You are okay with the stability of our healthcare and education system? It’s okay if you want steady, but look at the big picture of everything going on. Change makes everyone uncomfortable, but it’s necessary.   There are too many working class people struggling everywhere. Biden will not do much for the average American. At best you’ll get bank and auto bailouts, while many working people will pay for 1 medical emergency the rest of their lives. Don’t see them getting bailed out.
Yup, we actually show up to vote, unlike a different candidates “supporters” in this age group ;)
20 Texas! Glad I could help him take it last night.
Also 21 OC!
18 in OC🇺🇸
I’m not a US Citizen. I still support him, it’s like an long-term investment.
yeah that endorsement was the biggest thing for me
🍦😎 YEAH GOOD OKAY 😎🍦
Man, 2 paragraphs and not 1 fact. Almost like making false narratives based on no facts is your campaign's strategy.
Theyre both going to implement a public option. M4a isnt getting passed, and bernie knows it
[removed]
What false narratives?
The bank and auto bailouts are not a fact? Charging people who can’t afford healthcare in the first place an extra tax under Obamacare is not a fact? Voting to slash social security is not a fact?   Where is all of Mr Biden’s information about his policy on his website? I really don’t see any plans for the future whatsoever.
personally i was deciding between biden and warren. ideologically i was a lot more progressive so i was leaning warren-- but i didnt see her path to the nomination. decided i was gonna vote for her anyway but someone who i respected very deeply endorsed biden, so....
That Biden doesnt care about the average American, that Bernie can fulfill all these incredible promises with no negative effects, that the young people dont like Biden, etc.

So you’re telling me you believe this stuff? You’re backed by Bloomberg now. Weeks ago he said he would support whoever the Democratic nominee is. Now, essentially, he’s saying he won’t support Bernie, if that is the case. This might be to your surprise, but the nominee has not been decided yet.   From that, I deduce that I cannot trust everything Mr. Bloomberg says. His billionaire backed money now supports Mr. Biden’s campaign. The same billionaire money that is not redistributed throughout the middle class in this country. Stop taking me as a Bernie lover and see the situation for what it is. I’d like to have a civil conversation and see why you think the way you do. Does what I said there make any sense at all? Doesn’t that seem like it might turn out not so great in the end? Who is funding this campaign now and why?
Hillary lost because she got exposed for the email controversy right before the election. Clinton was associated with an impeached, controversial president, while Biden is associated with one of the best presidents in recent history in most American minds. Biden was racking up huge numbers in states he never advertised or even stepped foot in. Imagine what he can do with all of the advertisements and money from Bloomberg's campaign (can't stand Bloomberg, but cant deny he's valuable).   The candidate you should be scared of is Bernie. He just showed on Tuesday that he's having problems growing outside of his core voters. His fanbase is passionate and will definetly vote dem 2020 no matter what, but much of Biden's base won't show up at the pollsif Biden doesnt make it, worsening Bernie's turnout. Plus, Bernie is far less likely to get centrist votes.
Literally today on NPR: Only 19% of people polled think Sanders can beat Trump, vs 58% for Biden. Your fears are completely misplaced thanks to reddit and Twitter. Biden is much more likely to beat Trump, and Tuesday was all the proof you need.  He also has a very progressive platform and is not to the right of Hillary...but ok.

> So you’re telling me you believe this stuff?  > I’d like to have a civil conversation and see why you think the way you do  K.  You come in all a-ragin', shouting everyone down, then "want to have a civil conversation". I suggest you try that tactic within your own movement, and ask why young voters aren't turning out for your candidate, or why the only endorsements from former candidates are DeBlasio and Marianne Williamson, or why only ONE fellow Senator has endorsed him (his state-mate, Patrick Leahy). How do you think he will get his agenda through if the Senators he needs aren't on board with him now? Or are ALL of them "rigged"?
So you argued a point, I proved it wrong, and now you're moving to a whole new claim? Anyway, I think your missing a few things.  1. Michael Bloomberg is allowed to support any candidate he wants to, just like you can.  2. Michael Bloomberg is allowed to donate to any candidate he wants to, just like you can.  3. Just because you disagree with Michael Bloomberg (like I do), it doesnt make him evil.  4. Just because Michael Bloomberg is rich, doesnt make him evil.   No, I'm not a big fan of Bloomberg. But he's a human. He has the right to donate to any campaign that he wishes. Biden isn't accepting money from some foreign entity or an illegal source, he's accepting money from a Presidetial Candidate and New York Mayor. I dont know which of my last 2 reasons makes you hate him so much, but your disagreement doesnt take away his human right.

Another Reminder to be Respectful to Sanders Supporters Tonight.
100 Percent yes.   I invite Sanders supporters who are honest and/ or civil into conversation - all I have ever had issue with is people trying to spread misinformation about candidates or polarise by saying voting for the wrong candidate makes you a murderer.   I understand that lots of Sanders supporters are looking to get a brighter future for the nation and not being like the so called "Bro" subset   Sometimes the worst folks can be the loudest
Just some further advice:   Don't even go into their subreddit and wish them well or try to console them. The last thing they want to see or hear from is a Biden supporter, regardless of their intentions. This will change over time, but for a few days just keep your distance.
We don't want to give them more reason to hate us. Even if they say the most spiteful thing to you, be the bigger person.  You know the saying: don't argue with ignorance because they will bring you down to their level and beat you by experience?  Well, I've spoken to a lot of my friends who are Bernie supporters/Bros: they're rallying based on emotion and sentiment, so don't fight their emotion with your emotion because they will beat you with their experience.
I follow the old saying, don't start no shit there won't be no shit.  I am not going to their subreddit so as long as they keep the negativity there we are good.
I am a Sanders supporter and will vote for Joe Biden in a swing state. Trump must be defeated. We will never see progressive legislation passed if he wins again. In fact, the very foundation of our country and planet is at risk.
Yes- please.  Put your egos aside and focus on the real goal of defeating Trump. Sanders supporters are disappointed and mourning their loss - the last thing we need to be doing is pouring salt on the wound.  And try to shut down any other sore winners that are (supposedly) Biden supporters. We don't need people stirring shit and driving a wedge between the two campaigns. Unity it vital right now.
FOCUS ON THE MAIN GOAL: DEFEATING TRUMP!!  We must bring people together and bring people in, the more we can do that the better our chances!
Yes. Please be respectful and don’t be commenting or urging for Bernie to drop out and / or endorse. If we do that now, we risk a lot of those people the being Bernie or bust of 2020.
I know there’s been a lot of nastiness, but unfortunately we all need to be on Team Joe.   Let’s do our best to bring the rational Sanders supporters back on the team. The psycho ones will stay home or vote Stein, but most of them are good people who care about social justice
We must bring in Bernie Sanders supporters as much as we can!  Treat them with respect and keep being kind.  We will need them to defeat Trump!!
It's hard to be respectful to the bernie or bust type of supporters or the ones who say they are writing in, but to the reasonable ones sure.
Thanks
\#StrongerTogether
The thing that makes me most sad (as a Bernie supporter) is I feel like there’s no place for a sane person to go. All the Bernie subs are are delusional that he can still win. All the other subs are laughing at our demise.
So treat them the opposite of how they've treated everyone else?  Got it 👍
Engage them if they come to us but give them space - we have to hope that our civility and decency will eventually sway them to do the right thing. Hope we can grow out 11.4K tough & resilient Americans!
Yes please!
Agreed. Everyone may disagree; but in the end, we are all Americans. We may differ on how to run a country, but in the end we all are Americans.
I don't wade into their subs, but it is pretty annoying when they come in hot in ours.
Only if they return the same to me, and even not, I try to.  But it's hard when your mercilessly attacked for who u support ngl.
Don't comment in their sub, but do upvote posts that support rational thought, like all those that are trying to explain how much worse 4 years of Trump will be than 8 of Biden.
Yes, respect me! Lol. I realized Bernie was going to most likely lose on Super Tuesday and that's when I started looking to see what Joe Biden's policies are. Biden will need to start building unity and how he tries to do this will be interesting. My first piece of advice would be showcasing the policies that Bernie supporters might like like his green energy plan, housing plan, etc.
Well this is classy.
I'm for Bernie's ideas, just because Biden is the nominee doesn't mean Bernie has to disappear he already has impacted the democratic platform he should continue to do so.
Maybe you should have started being respectful long ago, instead of telling everybody they suck for months on end?  But who knows, maybe it didn't work out for HRC telling voters she hates them and her base hates them, but it'll work for Biden?  I guess we all just have to pray that Trump is so much worse than Biden, his supporters don't show up.  I might also win the powerball.  These things can theoretically happen.
I consider myself to be a progressive. I liked Warren and Sanders going into the primary season. I knew Warren didn't have a shot after the first 3 states. I knew Sanders didn't really have a clear shot after Super Tuesday. Joe got a gigantic media bump the day before super tuesday with all the endorsements, and it was kind of over.   However, you can disagree with me, but I do like that Sanders is still into the race to this point. I don't know if he'll drop out before the convention, but I actually hope he doesn't.   I'll say it: this party needs to move left, not to the right. Unfortunately with a lot of never trumpers voting for Biden, it signals this campaign might be appealing to right.   I'll be voting Joe Biden in the general election if and when he gets the nomination, but I want Sanders to remain to help move the conversation left.
I wouldn't waste my breath on the jobless losers on wayofthebern. I dont think they have the intelligence to figure out how to vote. Theres not that many of them anyway, their subreddit is dead.
This time is different. Bernie cannot win this. If he doesn't drop out at this point, he is literally *killing people* for his own stubborn ego. I will lose any respect I ever had for the man, and any remaining respect I have for his supporters. It is time to end this primary. Over three million people needlessly went out and spread coronavirus yesterday because of Bernie Sanders!
Elizabeth wasnt doing well WHILE SHE WAS PROMOTED BY THE MEDIA.   Then she *tanked* because she smeared her main "ally".   These are nowhere NEAR the same situations.
I don't see that happening.  The politics are really divisive here, and we're seeing tons of gloating people on the Biden side. "Humilated", "crushed", "destroyed", "bend the knee", "stupid commies", "tantrum throwing" and so forth.  That being said, it's not as though many Sanders people haven't been extremely toxic.  I will not be voting for Joe but I have the good grace to say "you won, congrats, good luck with it, it was a decisive victory, I now know where I and people like me stand. No wonder you don't respect us."
We never forgive and never forget. Have fun losing in November
I support Sanders.  I am also a younger voter.  I cannot vote for biden.  I would have been able to if the elections seemed fair and the establishment didn't put their fingers on the scale for biden.    If he had won on his own merits then fine.  But feeling like my vote will not have any worth whatsoever I cannot bring myself to vote for him.  The only way I could would be if he chose a progressive vp or said he will only be a 1 term president.    Otherwise it would be better in my opinion to elect Trump again and have a better chance in 2024 to get someone who is more aligned with my beliefs.      I fear that because of the establishment forcing biden to be the choice the way they did that they just lost the youth vote for a long time.  You have definitely lost me for this election.      I am not trying to be mean but I am just trying to get all biden supporters here to understand how me and most of my friends feel.  I think biden will lose the election to Trump since he will have lost the youth.  The boomers will vote Trump anyway and the older Dems will support any Dem candidate.  Independents think biden is corrupt or will vote Dem anyway so without younger people like me to combat Trump's overwhelming lead with boomers I can't see biden winning currently.
I'm voting for Biden because I want a status quo moderate. We have one chance to elect a revolutionary figure in Sanders, someone who is determined to aggressively fight corporate corruption in the government and provide sweeping basic welfare rights to all people, and I'd hate to see that. GO JOE!
Im a Sanders supporter. Even though I’m convinced he has no path, there is a good reason why he’s still in this race. He’s the only voice left that address the true dangers of climate change, our healthcare system, and other social issues that Biden isn’t touching or doing anywhere near enough to address them. Even though Biden keeps winning states by large margins, there’s still a huge generational gap and it’s not changing in favor of Biden. He’s going to have to come around with a more progressive agenda if he wants to reel in the young voters come November.
Really doesn't matter either way because us Bernie supporters will NEVER vote for Biden no matter what you say. This is not 2016. Even more of us will not be voting for Biden. You all have guaranteed a loss to Trump. So you are the ones that just need to accept this because it's not happening. Don's say we didn't warn you. Signed, a middle aged woman
It's been mentioned time and time again  Even though there are disagreements in approach, we all fundamentally want the same thing.
>Sometimes the worst folks can be the loudest  I think this is the biggest contributor to the "Bernie Bro" stereotype. They have the biggest social media presence, and social media in general is pretty toxic, so naturally you'll see disproportionately more Bernie supporters who are toxic. That's not a reflection of his supporters writ large.   I live in a caucus state. Everyone at my caucus was generally polite and supportive. Everyone understood this is bigger than one campaign.
I posted a question to this sub since it looks like my favored candidate (Sanders) is going to lose to try to warm up to Biden for the general, but it appears to have been silently removed?
Yo. I'm a sanders supporter. Your candidate is really alarming to me, but I'm willing to listen. Why do you guys like him? I don't see much to like.
While we are Bernie supporters, we are definitely not “bro’s”; and, I do take offense to wide sweeping generalizations. We believe that Bernie’s policies demonstrate tremendous compassion and love for all people. We will definitely vote for Joe in the general, but we will not stop pushing, dragging and pulling the DNC to policies that help everyone and not just a small subset of our society - namely the rich and connected.
mods from sandersforpresident will just insta-ban ya anyway.
Gotta socially distance.
Does r/politics count as one of their subreddits?
I just got banned for commenting on their "this is how Bernie can still win!11!" post and saying that they sounded like Hillary staffers trying to use faithless electors to change the 2016 election. They're deadass talking about how much of a benefit the coronavirus is.
Speaking only for myself, I welcome people coming into the sanders subs to talk about actual beliefs, values, and plans. However, I realize that across reddit people generally have no interest in opinions that challenge their own, so sorry if other people are being shitty. I’m sure that if you look at my post history you will disagree with me on many things, but I’m one Bernie supporter that is open to have a conversation about these things with anyone. Much love, let’s get rid of trump and make America suck a little less.
Be respectful and ignore the hostility. All I can say is a lot of people will be hurt tonight, some will be angry, some will say things that they are only brazen enough to online.     Kindness and empathy is the heart of Joe's message. We already are living in a hard and crazy time. Don't add unnecessary bitterness to it.
Yes! That would probably be the worst strategy. It must be organic and Biden actually has to do some outreach.
The best way to do this right now is to give them space. Let Joe Biden do the convincing in the coming days and weeks, he's much better at being respectful than 99% of the people on the Internet.
i have seen zero nasty comments towards neutral or positive bernie supporters; whether they're aligning or just admitting things didn't work out for whatever reason.  there are a ton of chapo and/or maga trolls taking the piss but meh.
Yup, we need to heal the divide, not \*exacerbate it.
First of all, I've been treated well by a number Sanders supporters and many of my friends are Sanders supporters, so it's important to not paint with too wide of a brush. But yes, we need to treat them well. Obviously it's the politically correct thing to do in order to unite the party, but it's also the right thing to do as a respectful human being.
Yes, you can treat people kindly even if they don’t treat you that way. It’s a shame that you’re asking this question rhetorically, as if it’s something unheard of.
Yes
>Biden will need to start building unity and how he tries to do this will be interesting.  I mean no disrespect, but you say this like he hasn't been doing this for weeks. Biden has made a strong effort to reach out to Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Warren voters. I'm sure he'll do the same after Sanders concedes.
Biden's most recent positions have been agreeing with Warren's bankruptcy plan, and Sanders plan for eliminating student loan debt and free college tuition for some, so I don't think moving right is a thing you should be worrying about.
I respect your opinion but I do disagree with you. Just take a look at /r/SandersForPresident, or any of the other Bernie subs, and all the vitriol they are throwing at Biden. It’ll be increasingly harder to unify as a party if Bernie will continue attacking Biden and his supporters will become even more convinced to sit out of the election. We’re basically looking at friendly fire among the democrats after we’ve already chosen our winner.
How many right leaning never trumpers do believe there are?
Jobless losers is quite insensitive. There are people losing their employment now because of caronavirus.
I'm a wayofthebern subscriber and I'm continuing to make 6 figures while WFH. Your stereotyping is offensive and self-defeating.
> Otherwise it would be better in my opinion to elect Trump again and have a better chance in 2024 to get someone who is more aligned with my beliefs.  I'm a Sanders supporter both in 2016 and 2020. This is an absolutely dangerous message to send. Some thought back in 2016, that maybe a Trump victory would send a progressive surge through Congress and it didn't happen. Progressives lost. In fact, all the Obama-era wins were crushed including vital environmental protections. Trump is selling off public lands to oil and gas companies as we speak, can you imagine another 4 years? Can you live with a 7-2 Conservative Supreme Court for generations which will likely end Roe protections and other social protections.   I understand why you're frustrated. I am older than you so I have been through this longer. Believe me I am politically Left of Biden. I share your pain. However, I ask that you rationalize this moment instead of making an emotional decision.   Any attempt at pushing this country Left/progressive will be impossible under four more years of Trump. We would never have a chance at changing health care, student debt, or fighting income inequality and installing worker protections. Our democracy will be sold to Russian oligarchs while corporate America will ransack every last piece of progress.   I ask you not to undermine the progress Bernie has acheived in the political system. Democrats were much more center/center-right 15 years ago and Biden has adopted many progressive positions. Don't screw this up for future generations. You must strongly consider the damage that would be done.
A status quo moderate preceded Trump. Why wouldn't the next status quo moderate lead to the same outcome? If Biden is elected I expect Obama's 3rd term and a Trump clone to follow in 2024.
He's going to have to come with a less progressive tone in the general actually... its how these things work.   We need younger voters to care about common goals over common tactics. Trump doesn't want what you want at all, Biden has common goals... he just has different tactics.
Sanders lost precisely because his youth supporters did what they always do: stay home. Given that literally every other age group votes more than twenty-somethings, it strikes me as bad strategy to tailor the campaign toward them.
Here's one that may convince folks who, like me, consider LGBTQ laws one of their priorities: Joe Biden is the only candidate who while discussing Russia paid serious attention to the issue that is almost never talked about. When we talk Russia, we start getting into the 2016 election meddling business, we most certainly talk a lot about how Putin is a dictator, how his relationship with Trump is disturbing, but have you ever heard this being discussed on the debate stage?     [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gay\_purges\_in\_Chechnya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gay_purges_in_Chechnya)   Quite frankly it's deplorable we do not talk about it. But Biden is the only candidate i am aware of that had adressed this with due seriousness and attention and in this he is unique. That's pretty big for anyone who cares about LGBTQ laws.
It's different now. He can't win. He is welcome to keep spreading his message on social media or whatever, but if he gambits Biden voters to risk their lives in order to prevent him from illegitimately stealing primaries due to his voters being younger and therefore less vulnerable, that would be worse than *anything* Clinton did to him in 2016.
I mean, the idea that Sanders is the only one addressing the real dangers of things like climate change and social issues (we can disagree about the healthcare one) just isn't factual.
>  there is a good reason why he’s still in this race. He’s the only voice left that address the true dangers of climate change, our healthcare system, and other social issues that Biden isn’t touching or doing anywhere near enough to address them.  ... AOC exists. Progressiveness isn't going to go out with Sanders.
Black Woman. I'm voting for Biden. Used to be a Sanders supporter in 2016. It was your type that sent me away. I don't expect every Sanders supporter will see the handwriting on the wall of another Trump term, or even that the women will see the cost to them. I suspect that many are alternate or complete Trump supporters at any rate and that the real ones who do not vote to remove the scourge, the B or B ones, who in spite of encouraging my vote or bragging about my vote and support of Sanders, would just as soon see me in chains again because I exercise my right to vote contrary to their choice. Too many told me just that at the end of the 2016 primary.   It's your gauntlet to throw. I see it and reject it emphatically. It is why I will vote for Biden in a primary and the General. This should tell Americans that there has to be overwhelming voting in the General to erase the poison/propaganda that infects political campaigns and many people in general. The positive change that can happen in a Biden administration will go a long way towards that end.   Be Best  NiceAssMe MD
Yep. We’re all on the same bus route going the same direction, it doesn’t make sense to take a bus in the opposite direction by helping Trump win out of spite.
Respectfully, and I'll get banned anyway, that's not true.  Sanders' message is that the system is broken (and we've seen that) and that business as usual doesn't work. Look at even Trump throwing UBI out there and begging for insurance companies to stop profiting for a second to get people tests and care because this is a crisis.   Joe? "Business as usual", "a return to normal", "nothing will change under my administration".  I get it, change is scary, but don't believe for a moment the two sides remotely want the same thing. Trump is such a disaster you'll win, but our loss and humiliation will go on decades.
except we dont. Biden wants a return to normal. Which has been failing for decades and has put america behind every other first world country. We need some big changes. Biden and his supporters do not want big changes.  We fundamentally want totally different things.  Im not bashing you for supporting Biden. But as of now he will not be getting the progressive votes that clinton didnt get.

Sometimes top level posts get marked as spam by the mods on election days because of the influx of trolling. We can answer qs here or in the daily thread. Sorry about that!
Howdy. I think it’s safe to say that Biden was not the first (or second, maybe) choice for most of us; the subreddit has tripled in membership over the last couple of weeks, as candidates dropped out. I was not at all amped about a Biden presidency, but reading his policies through made me feel a lot better. I’d read some before, but had no reason to do a deep dive until Biden was, you know, the only option left. I was very relieved when I finally went through the whole website, pleasantly surprised, even.  So, he wants $15 minimum wage, universal pre-k and community college and trade schools, decriminalization of marijuana and expulsion of marijuana-related offenses, increased funding for mental health and addiction services, an end to incarceration for drug use, repeal of Citizens United and right to work legislation, a carbon tax, a ban on new fracking operations, and he’s recently adopted Sanders’ College for All (families who make less than 125k) plan and Warren’s bankruptcy plan.  All that checked important boxes for me (even if I wish he’d just legalize marijuana and full-on end fracking, I realize what he’s proposing has a way better chance of getting passed exactly as-is, and it is an improvement). In more exciting news, he’s pushing a high-speed rail plan and $100b investment in improving public schools in his [Infrastructure policy](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure/), a plan for LGBTQ equality “in America and the World,” and his healthcare plan, while not perfection, is easily a massive improvement over what we have.  His [plan for Rural America](https://joebiden.com/rural/) addresses rural hospital closures, modernization of farms to help farmers, has a $20b investment in providing internet access to rural areas, and weaves in expertly with his climate plan.  Since you’re a Bernie guy, you’re probably going to want to see [the Biden Plan for Strengthening Worker Organizing, Collective Bargaining, and Unions](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/)  And honestly, I was impressed and relieved to read his [government reform plan.](https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/) It is far more expansive and right-on than I thought it would be.  Anyway, there’s a start. I wasn’t looking to become a Biden stan, but the more I perused his policies, the more excited I got. There will be massive improvements (and progress!) with a Biden presidency, which was a huge relief for me.
I think many of his ideas are going in the same direction as Sanders, but in a way that’s much more pragmatic and realistic. Yes, Medicare for All is a great end goal, but it just isn’t feasible at the moment. For example, start with a public option in health care, and at least we’re on the way there.
As primaries end, the question becomes less about who you’d like and more about who you’d prefer to fight against.  Biden is at least receptive to progressive changes - isn’t going to push for it as much as I’d like, but can be pushed into it.  So, the fight can shift to trying to elect the most progressive Senate/Congress that can win. If people could deliver the same progressive wave that Bernie said he’d need, then a lot of what Bernie wanted could still be accomplished.
For me, with Biden it's a lot of polices that maybe I kinda like or maybe I kinda disagree with but don't think are too bad.  With Sanders it's policies that I think are disastrous.
I was instabanned for being an undecided Warren supporter trying to engage on my misgivings with the campaign to see if they could sway me. Wonderful people, those guys.
just happened to me.
The way that sub is run makes me wonder if some of or all of the mods are Russians trying to influence the election?  Asking people to donate at this point and wishing Sanders stays in at this point only achieves 2 things. Kids losing money and more people going out to vote and risking getting sick. Why would anyone want that?
You are literally hurting Joe Biden's chances of becoming president. Stop entering their subreddit.
It’s true I saw several posts about the corona virus “helping them”.
So here's something I can never get Sanders supporters to answer:  If we can get affordable, universal health care, why do we need to also ban private insurance?  The responses I tend to get are "we need universal health care though" (...yeah, but did you read the question?), "why would anyone want private insurance" (if no one wants it the industry will go away on its own, why ban it?), and "fuck you, corporate shill." Or just silence.
Oh man we have had an influx of assholes in the sanders subs coming and and screaming about how theyre glad that "communist" was killed off by Biden. Its happening and its turning people like me away again. Im already pretty against most of bidens policies but I was hoping he would reach out and try to get me back. Its hard to believe that though.  2016 was partially decided by sanders supporters voting for Trump out of spite because of the bad blood between clinton and bernie. Its feeling that way again.
Exacerbate, but yes.
Or we can exercise that tumor once and for all. You don't feed cancer.
Thank you for this post and your comments. The internet makes it so easy to be vicious in a way you don’t encounter in person. I had a pretty pleasant experience today on this sub, randomly being awarded gold and simultaneously downvoted. Point being, there were a lot of Biden supporters who talked about issues with me in good faith, which mirrors what happens when I’m sitting across from friends who support a different candidates than I do.   The silver lining of tonight is that even if Bernie, my 1st choice, is out of the running, voter turnout has been great this year. I was always going to vote for the Democratic candidate, but there’s a sense of peace that it IS possible for us to make Trump a one-term presidency.
You can treat people more than one way, such as being kind while being disappointed in how they've conducted themselves.
None taken! I don't see anything he's done so far as real outreach for Bernie supporters, but that's probably at least in part to it being Bernie versus Biden. Yes, whenever Bernie drops out, I'd be curious to see what his real outreach looks like. I saw the speech he gave today where he talked to Bernie supporters directly, and that seems like a good first step.
/r/SandersForPresident is not the only progressive narrative.  They definitely have many more subscribers than the others, but progressives have representation in Congress and are moving forward with or without the presidential nomination.  Some contingent is always going to push for isolation but Trump's campaign will go scorched earth with lies anyway so the strategy can't be to fight fire with fire unless we plan to sink to their level.  Being objective, Biden can handle himself in any case and showing that hand is still extended to his supporters will mean a lot.  We might have different priorities but we can work together, that's the lesson we can teach when we are engaged in good faith political arguments.
I think there are a lot of conservatives who do not like Trump and are voting for Joe Biden. I just hope the party isn't trying to appeal to conservatives because they will more than likely vote GOP in the general election.   I need to see the campaign and the party in general move more left.
Wayofthebern subscribers never had jobs
You believe in ghosts.
Biden's goals include hitting climate policy benchmarks by 2050 when we need to reach them by 2030 to avoid catastrophic climate change. Just one example why "moderate" isn't always a virtue.
This is a myth. Youth turnout in many places went up. It's just that older turnout apparently also went up, and by a slightly larger amount, so youth turnout as a percentage went down. And it's especially insidious to say this considering the terrible way elections are conducted in this country. Have you heard all of the stories of young people being stuck for hours in line to vote, and eventually leaving only because they had to get back to work? The older retired voters who obviously don't have that problem and who are far more conservative were able to stay in line.
Joe is still largely bound by corporatism which is why his healthcare and climate change policies aren’t nearly as aggressive as they should be. If you look at his history in the senate throughout all the decades he was there, it’s not surprising that a big chunk of Sanders supporters don’t trust him. I would rather fight like hell for a blue congress but vote green or some other 3rd party in the general at this point. I would be fine with a trump presidency with a blue house and senate than 4 or 12 more years of neoliberalism
not even Sanders is going to go out. he will support Biden, if Biden wins he will continue working in the senate on implementing progressive policies, even if god forbid Trump wins he will do the same.
Same bus route? Really? Haha. Seriously though, Vote Blue everyone.
Change takes time. It's intrinsic in our system. Bernie is a populist like Trump, promising radical change, and Trump is proof that just doesn't work. Polls show that people *overwhelmingly* trust Biden to handle the crises over Bernie-- and it's pretty obvious why. In a crisis, the last thing people want is a revolution. They want responsible, pragmatic change.  I think it was Barney Frank who pondered whether pragmatism is the enemy of idealism or a necessary adjunct. In Bernie's case, it's very obvious he sees the two as being at odds-- he's gotten very little done in terms of legislation in 30 years in the Senate, although he's been important in driving the ideology of our politics.  Biden on the other hand has spent his career making incremental, meaningful change in our country. He might not pass the ridiculous purity tests Bernie and his supporters apply to him, but he's undeniably moved to the left and has said in his speeches that he has the same goals as Bernie.  Return to normal means building on the changes of the Obama presidency in a way that's actually attainable. Biden is running on a platform that's left of Obama who many Bernie supporters still adore while they call Biden a republican  I don't fault you for being idealistic, but the truth is (and what voters have realized) is that radical change just isn't achievable in our politics.
Warren supporter explains why they are voting Biden
The sad thing is, I'm reading that and all I can think is "they probably got SO much shit for this post..."  EDIT: oh ffs...so, I went to pull up the thread from the user's comment history to see what the response to their (triple-gold) post was, and...  >Comment removed by moderator  I literally could not be less surprised if I tried.
"the left will never forget this". What a weird ass threat lol.
This is only tangentially related to the post, but her mention of those percentages reminded me that I keep seeing this idea that Joe’s platform and Elizabeth’s are far apart.  Is such a gulf so real and big that someone could agree with 95% of one and only 30% of the other, or are people overestimating the difference in their policies?
When Pete dropped out and they tried to swoop in like vultures while we were still grieving and before Pete had even started considering endorsing Biden, the vast majority of us on TeamPete had the same mentality. Like, ROTR, but yeah, you spent the last six months calling Pete a rat fuck and us traitors, shills, and closet Republicans. It was such an easy choice to support Joe, especially once the endorsement came in. I’ll take a big slice of sanity with a side of inclusion, and a Dr Pepper, thanks!
The 'left' will forget it. She didn't endorse in 2016 either. People tried very hard. She didn't do it. Her explanation was that she wanted to stay neutral and let the voters decide who they want. And that she would work as hard as she could for whoever the nominee was.   Most of the people labeled as moderates are not moderates. We were/are 'the left', liberals and progressives who just had a big group join our team and tell us we were moderates.
Yeah I’d say I’m probably more left leaning than Biden but this person is right that we literally can not afford another 4 years of Trump, not morally, not logically not practically. If Trump wins, the climate crisis will escalate beyond control, more people who are poor will be hurt, and there will be 4 more years of absolutely nauseating polarization. I’m finding myself getting more and more excited for diamond Joe, we gotta win and he can do it.
I cannot *believe* how much invective Sanders supporters directed against Elizabeth Warren.  Elizabeth Warren represents every good characteristic of the progressive movement I can possibly think of. Her principles are rock-solid, and her plans are strong. And where they're not strong, she's willing to change her policies to make them better. I admire that intensely.  But just because she wasn't *their guy,* the Bernie Bros treated her and her supporters terribly. That's reprehensible.  It should have been Elizabeth Warren running against Biden. She fights hard, but she and her supporters fight clean and fight fair. She deserves the VP slot—and if Bernie's constitutional lawyers were right about it being legal, she deserves Treasury Secretary at the same time too.
Warren and Sanders had a lot of the same policy ideas. One of the big reasons people went for warren instead of sanders is they didn't like the tone of the Sanders campaign.
The Bernie Bros are upset because Warren hasn't endorsed Bernie "yet." They seem to think Warren must do their will and they aren't too nice about it. Go figure.
Yea, many of the warren supporters I know (myself included) heavily value critical thinking skills. Unfortunately critical thinking is somewhat of a scarce trait in our society... So maybe I have to conceed that point to the Biden campaign, the way to win the dem nomination is not through well though out plans but rather via name recognition and demographics.    My primary is tmw, in a state that Biden will easily win and GOP will get in the general (MS). So my choice, as someone who voted Sanders 4 years ago, is do I want to add my almost meaningless vote (as a liberal in Mississippi) to the person who is not going to win my state and who I personally feel, after analyzing the numbers and trends, is not going to win the primary. Or am I going to vote for Biden who is much less progressive than I like but my vote will be a +1 in the overall popular vote column towards uniting this party behind someone and ending this contest before the convention.   So yea, I subbed here and plan on voting for Biden tmw even though he was in my  bottom 3 in the first debate. I do appreciate how even though things looked rough for him he waited for his critical and correct moment to play his big cards which led to his big win in SC and on super tuesday. Bernie's biggest card he had to play, the AOC endorsement, he had to play to gain momentum after his heart attack. The momentum from that endorsement took the wind out of Warren's sails but was almost meaningless since it happened months before any votes were cast.
My best friend was talking Warren up for 2 years until last week.  Instead of crying on Super Tuesday, he was thrilled that BS wouldn't be the nominee.
Warren supporters are such good people. They seem to be extraordinarily good communicators, too. Yet, after ridiculing and insulting them, when they give a great response like this eloquently explaining their prerogative, they are met with more vitriol and downvotes and removed comments. It's just awful how they've been treated.
Really interesting take. By the way, what subreddit is this?
"The left will never forget this". Lmao Bernie Bros are delusional.
My primary support is for Bernie, and I voted Bernie in the primary. But, I would not feel upset voting for Biden in November at all. Not even holding my nose like I did for Hillary, the two are not the same. I came to this subreddit so I could better understand what Biden has to offer and get out of the Bernie bubble. I feel like centrists and progressives generally agree on the same priorities, the question where they differ is how to get there. Recognizing this allows for there to be common ground and to meet in the middle, seeing what can be compromised on for both ends. The only way we can beat trump is by unifying the wings, and that can only happen with communication, understanding and outreach.
Talked about this back on the Yang sub a while back, I think there's basically two camps of Bernie supporters:  (1) Ordinary folks for whom health care is the #1 priority and they like M4A or just support Bernie because he's the one most strongly associated with health care.  (2) Socialists. Like actual socialists who support Bernie even though he's too far *right* for them, but he's the closest they've got. Socialists who call other socialists not real socialists because they don't believe in anarcho-socialism as the one and only true socialism.  I think the nastiness is almost entirely from that second group.
u/dasbiermann is the left.    u/dasbiermann does not forget
LOL the comment was removed.
Say it louder for the people in the back
Are Bernie Bros gonna apologize after all this shit show? Or should we force them to do that?
Yep yep yep.
This is a really good insight. One thing that hasn't been priced in to Sanders' polls nationally is all the shit he's put the Dem party through at various points over the last 5 years is going to spill over onto the general electorate. I don't know if it would work, but I can't imagine it helping us too much. There's always a double standard for the left and they need to realize that sharpish.
Yeah, because the moderate democrat worked SO well in 2016...
All campaigns from every side brings toxicity. Its how politics has worked for a long time. What we need to do is stop being toxic amongst ourselves and realize we are on the same side against a greater evil. I do agree that toxic campaigning and negative attacks are unhelpful but the biggest problem is that were doing it to each other along with the opposing side. How can we expect to win the bigger race when were beating the shit out of our own teammates? Also im not trying to argue or be an ass. I just finished a long weekend of writing a very large final paper and decided to vent on this post. I apologize if my comment came across as anything other than dems just need to stop fighting other dems when the personification of satan sits in power 😅
I wish I had the guts to post this  There are things I cannot post without getting raked over the coals: calling out MLM bullshit and anything that might make me look like a Biden fan.
Out of curiosity, how does someone support a candidate who lies about their friend being a sexist? Sanders hasn't even called her a snake, he never said anything. This guy is full of shit, either forgets the facts and even lies... Is this what "Warren supporters who vote for Biden" look like?
Who. Fucking. Cares. Can we all please just agree that ANYONE is better than trump and instead of splitting so heavily amongst ourselves while the right stays unified under trump, we unifying as DEMOCRATS rather than biden vs bernie supporters and focus on kicking that orange piece of shit and his fake ass family to the curb?
What that post tells me is that people vote for Biden not because of his platform, but because he is the "Not Trump, not Bernie" candidate, and it's unclear if simply being an alternate candidate is enough to beat Trump. I'm sure Biden has a platform somewhere out there, but a majority of the coverage over Biden in the mainstream media and online relate to how likely he is to be the nominee, not over his platform or any of his policies. And who knows, maybe "electability" trumps platform in this race. But Romney was a first and foremost a "Not Obama" candidate, and his campaign couldn't stand on it's own in any other area. Biden's campaign needs to dramatically shift the focus from being the nominee to being the one to bring meaningful change or else 2020 is just going to be a repeat of 2016.
Coalition building is not Bernie’s team problem, it’s one of their biggest strengths. Primaries are where you duke it out. It’s supposed to be antagonistic.   This person is essentially making the electability argument. Given this person supported Warren, I’m interested to hear why they felt Warren was more electable than Biden or Bernie.  Edit: rephrased for clarity
Trump literally won against a moderate, with a much worse fanbase, that was not just "mean" and "bullies", but also racist and sexist. And he still won. And now you want to do the same. Vote for a moderate that will lose against Trump.  Anyone following this post's line of thought, PLEASE watch this video. https://youtu.be/BKDgE1rcEoA Progressives have a notable history of winning the general, and moderates, of losing it. We can't lose this opportunity to beat Trump because Bernie's supporters are mean. There's more at stake.
Imagine thinking that Biden has a better shot at beating Trump than Bernie. Dude can't even complete sentences. They're turning the next Democratic debate into a town hall with pre-screened audience questions so Biden doesn't have to think on his feet. If you guys can't see through this then I don't know what to tell you.
Shocking behavior from the mod staff over there  There was nothing in that post that was an attack on anyone. Nothing derogatory or rude. Nothing but a candid attempt to break through their dismissive dogma with a candid explanation of a totally valid position  And removed, for running against the religion   “r/politics” should be forced to be renamed or removed from reddit all together.   Place is a genuine danger to democracy disguised as a source of news
I looked out of curiosity, and yep.
Their second edit tripped the AutoMod.   They also used that same edit to kind of troll Sanders supporters.   If they edit that part out a bit I could approve it.
Yep, I've returned to S4P a few times to explain why I decided to not switch to Bernie, and to dispel some lies such as that edited stumbling video where Biden says "Trump can only win". Just got permanently banned. Honestly, im not even upset. I had a good time there in 2016, and now they banned me on the 11th hour of Bernie's campaign anyway. He's probably not going to recover his numbers, and hes probably not running for president again after this. So they can become the lefty T_D for all I care.
Kind of a weird thing to say to people who could help save your sinking ship
Yes, we're all very scared of a direction.
It’s comedy at this point.
It would be a credible threat if they actually voted.
In about 10 years, the young BS voters will actually be politically mature enough to vote in large numbers.  The Boomers will have largely left the political stage.  At that point, we will get much more left-leaning policies, and we will need them to combat global warming and other crises that Republicans have ignored or exasperated.  BS will also likely not be on Earth any more.
They are correct. The left won't forget how Bernie made his extreme views completely toxic.
Get off my side, I say.  To the jackasses.
"The left" has done fucking nothing for 30 years. They'll forget this too.
It's hard to say because it's subjective for everyone. People give different weight to different policies.  For example, to me I think Biden has a climate change plan. But if you asked a Bernie supporter they would say he dosen't have one because they don't see it as grand enough.
No. And I would disagree with those saying it's subjective. It's not. Joe and Warren objectively agree on the vast majority of issues. Even Joe and Bernie do. Their differences are largely those of degree and approach, not so much substance. Where there are substantive differences, it's still not like they are on opposite sides of the political spectrum. They just envision different solutions to problems they both recognize, but that the GOP would either argue are not problems or are even in fact good things.  The idea that you can agree with 95% Warren but only 30% Biden is patently absurd. So much so it unfortunately makes me want to discount this entire post, despite otherwise being well-written. This idea that Biden is somehow far removed from these supposedly more "progressive" candidates policy-wise is completely wrong and harmful.
>Is such a gulf so real and big that someone could agree with 95% of one and only 30% of the other, or are people overestimating the difference in their policies?  I don't really find worth in this train of thinking. Politics isn't about the America you want, it's about what America is and what it can be. And ideology is fairly insignificant compared to governing ability - building coalitions forming alliances etc. In the case of Sanders, what good is a bold revolution if it never makes it past a Senate? Warren has some ambitious desires for greater economic restructuring. But it's more important to work on being IMO a stabilizing force and building a consensus that democrats can do a better job. Not to mention obvious things like gerrymandering, voter suppression.
> The 'left' will forget it.  Tonight we might learn that they already have.
I was Yang Gang and then for Bernie, but Joe really exciting me now out of no where. We need Bernie in the Senate with Warren and other Democrats to get stuff passed from Biden. I really believe Warren is withholding her endorsement until July at the convention.
Dude the whole Sanders subreddit was calling Pete a CIA plant, said he wasn't actually gay and  Chasten was an actor, shit like that. They're completely toxic.
Warren was, at her core, a believer in capitalism. You can imagine how that played with the true socialists in Bernie's camp. She's not every good thing about the progressive movement -- she's a traitor.
I can see this and also find it absurd. Wouldn't things be better if everyone voted on policies. Who cares what another voter does. People are are being petty.
That was why Warren was much higher on my candidate rankings than Bernie, even if their goals are similar. His long history of pseudoscience and disregard for evidence shows his thought process. His strive for ideological purity over results is a dangerous game to play when people's lives are on the line.
I do have to agree that everything that happened leading into Super Tuesday was probably the single most brilliant piece of political strategy I've seen in my lifetime.
Just to note, one of the mods commented elsewhere in this thread, stating that the comment was removed because one of the edits violated that subs policies. It seemed reasonable.
We can all take solace in the fact that there is no chance in hell he's going to run again in 2024, so his maniacs will have to disperse among other candidates. The presumptive dem nominee (assuming Trump isn't reelected) will probably be whoever Joe picks as a running mate and grooms. Given how much the office ages people, I would be surprised if Joe tried to do a second term.
“These two people are “moderate” therefore they must be the same person”
There is a fallacy there.  There is no reason to think Sanders would of won in 2016 just because Hillary lost.
The moderate in 2016 was a wretched, despised, megalomaniacal, entitled, borderline autistic woman who was caught cheating and issuing marching orders to the media as if they worked for her. Biden is a lovable goofball who "takes the train to work" and has been adored by blue collar workers for decades.
Looks like one of these candidates is doing a *great* job of uniting the party.
The problem is though that only one campaign has consistently run a toxic and hate fueled bid for the dem nomination.
It’s about bringing awareness to campaigns of toxicity. If they don’t learn their lesson now, they may never learn which only hurts the Democrats long term.
/u/42kyokai I don't think you can say why "people" in general vote for Biden. Of course he has a platform [out there somewhere](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/) and we're in general quite familiar with it. Plenty of us are voting for Biden not just because of who he isn't but because of who he is, and what he stands for, like [pushing for justice and safety for LGBT people not just in the USA but worldwide](https://joebiden.com/lgbtq/), and [aggressively pursuing corporations for wage theft and exploitation of their workers](https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/), or [changing the law to include escaping from domestic violence under the hardship extensions that permit early withdrawals from retirement funds](https://joebiden.com/vawa/), or [covering everyone under a public healthcare option, even if they can't afford to pay any premiums](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/), or [providing tuition-free community college and vocational schools, smoothing the transition from them to bachelors programs, and capping and forgiving the amount of debt that a student can be obligated to pay](https://joebiden.com/beyondhs/).  Just because you're unfamiliar with his platform doesn't mean his voters are.
You’re a warren supporter and a Libertarian? How does that work?
Obama was a moderate, Bill Clinton was a moderate. Your post makes no sense.
What works one election cycle dosen't work another election cycle, because current event, expierences, voter demographic changes.  2016 was prime time for a "anti-establishment" candidate. We got Trump because of it.   That time has passed and now people want unity.
Biden and Hilary were literally left of Obama but good try sport
What does it say about Bernie that such a person is beating him by double digit margins in most states and nationally?
If you honestly believe this then how do you believe Sanders will be Trump when he clearly can't even beat Biden ? Lol
dang i assumed this was CTH. r/politics has just deteriorated so much over the past few years. Or maybe I've grown more conservative because I remember that sub being liberal but not the unfathomably sheltered echo chamber that it is now.
What is r/politics going to do when Biden is the nominee which is practically inevitable? Are they going to spend all their time posting Biden hate and screaming about how they won’t vote? Will they endorse Trump? What will happen to them?
arrpolitics should be quarantined i mean it’s basically as rotten as chapo, t_d, and sfp at this point.
Out of curiosity, what was the edit?  Shame it was removed because the initial comment was very well written.
I got permbanned over there a while back for answering a direct question about why I wasn't voting for Bernie. So.....par for the course.
As a Warren supporter, if they don't want us, that's fine we really don't give a shit lol. Warren's still in the Senate and she's still passing progressive policy within the Democratic party while they're sitting at home talking about purity tests.
I am a Bernie Sanders supporter, and all I have come here to say is this. Bernie has denounced anyone who uses hate or vicious attacks against any candidate including Warren and Biden. I am not here to tell you who to vote for, or what you should support. Bernie himself is fighting a clean fight. He may ultimately lose the nomination but the man practices what he preaches.  Don't let the voices of a radical few shape your opinion of Bernie Sanders. I ask you only judge him on what he is campaigning for. If you believe that he is not your cup of tea I can definitely support that, but there are definitely people on both sides who could use a chill pill. No matter who you vote for just go out and vote as that is the most important thing here at the end of the day!
Sanders supporters are disenfranchised. You just wait until they drop the voting age to 14, then Bernie will be unstoppable!
Biden himself said he was the Bridge from now to a younger generation of politicians who will push for more change. Implicitly, people like Booker, Buttigieg, and so on. Biden knows and supports this, but it can't happen in an environment beset on the sides by right-wing AND revolutionary populism. That's why it needs to be him now, and them (the younger politicians) next.
Eh, Bernie isn’t that extreme really. He’s just a poor campaigner and picked awful people to run his campaign org. If you look at 2018, even though he was pretty much the Dem frontrunner, his org totally bombed: https://ballotpedia.org/Our_Revolution.
Do you really mean that? That Warren supporters who aren’t quite sure where to turn should “get off your side”? To where? To Trump?  Or am I misunderstanding?
Funny, I don't think Bernie has a climate change plan because his presidential authority would actually allow him to harm our progress while his legislative agenda is both politically unpassable and, to be generous, ignorant of the actual implications of climate change.
I might be exceptionally ehhhhhhhhh on Bernie but the one role he IS really important in is just being in the senate dragging people left. Doesn't mean I want to give him the keys to the white house, but I'm perfectly happy for him to spend the rest of his career (such as it is) yelling at people about healthcare.
I consider myself a pragmatic liberal, and I agree. It’s important for progressive voices to stay strong and help Joe move us forward if he wins.
I’ve been reading all the candidates’ subs through the primary, and I gotta say that Bernie’s sub reminds me a little of the_donald, kinda like two sides of the same coin.
Go over there now and there are a ton of posts saying Biden has dementia. It’s a shame.
This. Let’s not forget the Sanders staffer who loved to throw around the f slur and said Chasten was inches away from becoming a bored methhead housewife.
Agreed, running a toxic campaign with toxic staffers who spread conspiracy theories should not be a factor at all.
Politicians cater to their base though. If the base is toxic, expect that to be reflected in how the politician governs. If the base wants calm rationality, they'll get calm rationality. If they reward throwing fire bombs, that's what they'll get.
I've yet to figure out in life whether I'm a pragmatic idealist or an idealistic pragmatist, but yeah....even in years where I've agreed with Bernie on what should be done, I've never quite believed he was capable of it, and a lot of that is because he never quite managed to SAY how he was capable of it.
That mod said this user was merely quoting the vitriolic comments they received as proof. Mods can re-approve comments in situations like that. They used that as an excuse to remove his/her eloquent comment.
Cool, you provided several links from his campaign website. The more important question is, why aren't people talking about these more? Where is the coverage on those campaign points in the media? Why are almost none of the submissions on the top page of this subreddit talking about his platform or things from it that people are genuinely excited for? Biden brings a gravitating charisma to his campaign, but why in his rally earlier tonight in Detroit did he not mention more than half of the points in the links that you just posted?  The fact of the matter is that to the media, the voters, and even Joe himself, the issues seem to be on the backburner to being an electable candidate, and if issues don't come front and center, we're going to be in big trouble in the general election.
To be honest, trying to figure out who I support or which ideological box I neatly fit in would probably give you a headache. Ultimately, it’s not about me.  Edit: for clarity, I’m not saying I’m supporting Warren. I’m referring to the person in the screenshot.
Obama ran as a progressive, Bill Clinton was an outlier, and the election he won had the most ever Independent votes (meaning it wasn't even that big of a win). Watch the video, it makes this point way better than I can.
It doesn't really say anything about Bernie. It's more telling of the Democratic base - so easily swayed on the issue of 'electability', not voting for a candidate despite the fact that they agree with almost all of their policies. Just like what this post is about: letting an incredibly small percentage of ill-behaved people outweigh the needs and hopes of millions of others.
It has legitimately become anyone who transgresses against the on true god must be silenced.   Arguably more toxic that die hard Trumpers
I mean I am apparently right of Antonin Scalia because I supported Hillary in 2016.   I think people are just tired of this self-radicalization and just want a return to normalcy. Sanders is not selling that but the Democratic party is.
It's fine...when it's not election season. Then the bots get involved and it's a hellscape. 2016 was the same. All anti-Hillary stuff. Now it's all pro-B\*rnie stuff. Unsubscribed.
Nah. I'm a Warren supporter and I got called a Republican. A warren supporter. It's not just you.
That's what happened in 2016. Expect a lot of Bernie or Bust arguments and former Biden supporters who saw the light and other fabricated crap. Russia will be huuuge there. Right now, they're retooling after getting burned for villifying Bloomberg too much while forgetting about Biden. Oopsie.
This is what truly worries me this election.
They quoted PMs that they got which are what triggered the AutoMod.   They then called those kind of people out.   Its against our policy to let people edit comments to troll or call people out.
Column: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s 87th birthday should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden
Kudos to her for hanging in there. She's a fighter on many fronts.
My heart stops for a second every time I see her name in a headline.
Democrats being able to pass legislation without a veto should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden.  An EPA not in the hands of coal companies should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden.  Net Neutrality should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden.  Blue States not being forced to expend resources fighting every Muslim Ban and 3-D gun printing executive order should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden.  Protecting the national park system should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden.  And yes, allowing Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire and pass on her torch to another liberal justice should be motivation for Democrats to back Biden.
If there's anything we can learn from Republicans blindly backing their party it's that they get the SC justices they want. So important that we elect a Democrat this year and flip some Senate seats!
If you get a chance watch the RBG documentary from 2018. She’s unbelievable.
But if I vote for Trump in protest in the general election, this will force the DNC to realize I am such a powerful turd that they will need to rig the 2024 primary in favor of a socialist, or something. /s
Let the lady have a vacation! Elect a democrat!
Yep she’s the only reason I would vote for Joe
I have a lot of sympathy for RGB's situation.  She's shouldn't be in the position where every cough she makes is national news.  It's tragic.  Honestly the current balance of the court is fine so I wouldn't mind if Trump could work out a deal of some sort to replace her with a like-minded justice.
Unpopular opinion: she was incredibly selfish for not resigning after the 2012 election. If Trump gets to choose her replacement, she will have set the court back for a generation.
It took me reading to word number 10 to realize I was holding my breath
You too?
Thanks. You've actually made me question my neverbiden stance.
Let's not forget the children in cages.
We absolutely have to flip the Senate.  We have to keep the [the eleven Democratic seats that are up](https://www.270towin.com/2020-senate-election/), go after four tossups, and try to flip some leaning Republican seats.  Kansas will be one to watch.  Pat Roberts is retiring.  If Kris Kobach wins the GOP nomination, I think the Democratic candidate, Barbara Bollier, has a shot.  She’s a recent party changer, but she’s a moderate state senator in favor of Medicaid expansion.  We flipped a House seat in 2018 and have a shot at another, so hopefully we can flip a Senate seat too!
how was she supposed to know all of this was going to unfold?
Another unpopular opinion: I think the Supreme Court is actually much less concerned with partisan politics than people think, and I don't think justices should be making decisions based on political outcomes.
Damn, that is unpopular. But I respect the hell out of it. I almost agree. I LOVE RBG but we shouldn’t put anyone above criticism. Great stuff.
Obviously the move would help the Democrats. That's why I HEAVILY disagree with it, as a Democratic voter.  The Supreme Court shouldn't be playing the game of politics, it should be making decisions based on law. Partisanship shouldn't be a factor and cannot be allowed to become a factor. Otherwise, there's no point in having a SCOTUS, and the system of checks and balances would be broken. The judicial branch would be weakened and the legislative branch would be strengthened.  Plus, keep in mind this precedent can backfire on you. If there's 5 conservatives and 4 liberals, and the precedent is set that playing politics is fine, then every single SCOTUS decision will be 5-4 or 4-5, and the ruling would be against your interests. We don't want that. It isn't fair to anyone.

I think it's important to remember the president is one person, but the party being in control means hundreds of people, all across the political spectrum, have a chance to make progress on their agendas. If you don't like Biden's stances and think they aren't progressive enough, good on you (seriously, not sarcastically).   The best way to go up against them is to get Biden in office and keep working on the grassroots progressive movements that would be further left. Because those movements will have a lot stronger support under Biden and his VP than under Trump and Pence.  I think the focus on the lesser of two evils talk is the wrong approach. This is really about the possibility to make change vs. being obstructed. It really is the better option, not the lesser of two bad ones.
> She’s a recent party changer  In a state like Kansas, that seems like a good thing. A lot of moderates can probably relate.
...yes
Another unpopular opinion:  the court should decide laws, not make them.
> I don't think justices should be making decisions based on political outcomes.  If only they agreed with you lol
So we all wish. Organizations like the Federalist Society are ensuring that there's a pipeline of young, activist, conservative judges to fill lifetime appointments at all levels, and thanks to GOP stonewalling, McConnell is now filling the vacancies that they prevented Obama from filling.  This is why the Senate is arguably as important, if not more so, than the who is in the White House.
> The Supreme Court shouldn't be playing the game of politics, it should be making decisions based on law.  The only people who think this way are obviously not lawyers. 95% of the stuff the Supreme Court resolves lacks a clear "based on the law" answer. That's why judicial philosophy is so important -- it's essentially inescapable because philosophy is the only thing that can fill in the gaps when the law is vague.   After all, what the fuck does some vague-ass shit like "due process of law" even mean? The Constitution is full of vague nothings that only get meaning as defined by judges who are applying their own personal beliefs.  The Supreme Court has *always* been political, literally all the way back to *Marbury v. Madison*, a case that arose out of partisan court packing.
Judges retiring at a time when they will be replaced by someone who agrees with their judicial philosophy is 100% the norm.
Democrats controlled the Senate until 2014
>  have a chance to make progress on their agendas.  > The possibility to make change vs. being obstructed  maybe...  or maybe biden is an obstruction  https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4agb9n/it-sure-sounds-like-joe-biden-would-veto-medicare-for-all-if-he-were-president
Thanks. I agree that downballot is more important.... a lot of what you said made sense.  There's a lot of accelerationist talk. That it's good for things to get bad, so they can get better. That a rotten system should be allowed to die.  There's also the argument that democrats haven't elected a progressive, like ever - FDR was the last one in memory. The DNC has instead run a lot of moderates and lost. The Right seems to keep running more radical candidates.. and seems to be doing well. Trumps odds of reelection look decent.  If we keep voting for moderates that's all we'll ever get right?
Yep.  I’m a lifelong Democrat and would love to see a true Democrat get elected rather than a DINO, but I’ll take what I can get.
that’s not what I asked. I didn’t say “how? was she supposed to know all of this would happen?”
Unpopular opinion: put our girl Judith Sheindlin on the Supreme Court. Only Judy can judge me.
Yeah, M4A is definitely a wedge issue here. Personally, I don't like M4A because there are a lot of people (like myself) who are middle class but because of the specifics of how my benefits were done would make less after taxes and not get as much benefit under Sanders' plans.  In my case its because I am a government employee with my wages set by legislation. I would pay more in taxes than I do in premiums and the lack of deductible wouldn't make up for it. Certain union employees are the same way where they would have to spend a lot of time negotiating new wages to get back to where they are now after negotiating for years to get here (although I've talked to some union employees who do not have this).  That being said, what Biden says here (about wanting to make sure it doesn't have a high cost) and what he would do in the unlikely event moderate and progressive Democrats actually passed this legislation could be two very different things. The truth is there are Democrats in the Senate who are more Moderate than Biden so if any M4A plan has gotten through them would almost certainly be a plan Biden would approve.
The problem, as I see it, with this way of thinking is that it doesn't really take into account the current demographics of the country. That would be a potentially good way of looking at it if the country was 1/3rd progressive, 1/3rd moderate, and 1/3rd conservative. But the truth is the country has more conservatives than progressives and more moderates than progressives.  Further the way our electoral college is set up the already skewed demographics are further forced right by being over-represented. So progressives have an uphill battle right now. It's so much easier for the right to run a radical candidate because they don't need to convince as many moderate undecideds as progressives do. For every two they need we need three (as an illustrative example, I don't have the numbers).  So when people talk about accelerationism and talk about "punishing" moderates for not coming left enough, my question always is at what point are we more likely to go to the right than to the left. If the voting demographics shift we will go further left, but as they stand now we just can't go as far left as republicans can go right.  I think Bernie did a great job at something. He did change the Democratic platform after 2016. Biden is definitely a moderate by the field we saw, but look at his platform. For a moderate it's got so many progressive policies that we progressives would have dreamed of 4 years ago, much less 8 or 12. Paid family leave, closing private prisons, $15 minimum wage, etc.   Could he come left on issues like marijuana? Yes, I personally think so. 2008 Obama could come left on gay rights, and thanks to Joe Biden forcing him to he did. We have no idea what Biden will do or what will happen. Even FDR's campaign ran on a much more moderate campaign than the New Deal. A lot of Bernie supporters point at his conservative votes as proof he's just a conservative who won't do anything progressive. I personally see it as someone who has evolved and become more progressive over time. So if he were to go one direction I see him being moved left not right on certain issues.
> Judith Sheindlin  Hahahah I'm kind of surprised the reality-star-in-chief hasn't done that.
I second that motion.
> Yeah, M4A is definitely a wedge issue here. Personally, I don't like M4A because there are a lot of people (like myself) who are middle class but because of the specifics of how my benefits were done would make less after taxes and not get as much benefit under Sanders' plans.  That's wonderful for rich assholes like you and me. I have a cadillac plan through work that I pay peanuts for. But millions are uninsured. Including my girlfriend, a 22 year old grad student with no way to pay for insurance. If she got seriously ill today with cancer or something, she would be in debt for **life**  but sure, you and I are better off saving a few bucks, everyone else can burn
The only way Donald would get everyone in America on board with something he’s done.
Honestly, I would take her over who he actually appointed.
That's not really a fair representation of what I said. First of all, I think a public option which gives access to affordable healthcare for anyone who needs it is the best option.  Secondly, I am very much middle class and am able to do public service instead of making over twice as much in the private sector because of benefits like my healthcare. If I had to pay more in taxes it would make that a lot harder. And the people in these positions are important. Teachers are in this position. Public defenders are in this position. These are not rich assholes. Forcing them to pay more in taxes, for very little benefit, without compensation for that is going to make it impossible for some.  I'm not making six figures here. I'm doing important work for the community benefit. That's a large group of the people who are being asked to make sacrifices who are getting ignored in this debate often. It's not the rich vs. the poor only.
I take it you don't like beer or calendars.
yeah, I don't make 6 figures either - I would also pay more under a public option.
Florida zoomer here. Just cast my vote for DIAMOND JOE
Are they not voting because of the pandemic or because they don’t want to?
Thanks!   You’re an amazing person and you just helped America
Thank you
# 💎🐊👍
As a fellow Floridian who unfortunately voted way too early for Pete, good job!  &#x200B;  Bernie can't possibly win Florida, especially in the general election.
Thanks!! I’m gen z in FL too, but I’m too young to vote. I’m glad someone else is doing what I would do :)
Voter turnout is something I’m worrying about. I just hope it doesn’t skew the results.
From twitter:  Interesting data point on FL Democratic presidential primary:   Combined early vote and vote-by-mail numbers so far for 2020: 1,097,183  Final combined early/mail for 2016: 889,207
Thanks for voting!

I just checked your profile because your username looked familiar. You seem pretty clear that you are on Reddit to "troll the libs". Why should any of us consider your alleged support of Uncle Joe as sincere? Can you explain what made you decide to support Biden?
Voted for Biden today in Florida too!!
Imagine if Bernie ends up non-viable in Florida as Sanders Campaign focuses on calling to cancel and delay primaries.
Voted for Joe Cool in the Grand Canyon State today!
Good to have you among the ranks. Sometimes you just gotta say no to that malarkey.
I voted Sunday for Diamond Joe in early voting in Broward county.  No lines , very clean, very simple.  Everyone should do it!  No crowds.  Just be smart, keep your distance from people, don't touch face and use hand sanitizer/wash your hands thoroughly after touching the voting equipment, pens , door handles etc
RIDE THE  💎 JOEMENTUM 💎 🌊 🌊 🌊 🌊  Let's kick up enough of a blowout to end the primary season
Millennial for Biden here...good on you for voting!
I voted for Joe today. no malarkey in the voting station and a lot of people voting.
I mailed in my ballot last week but I'm not going to bring it up with my friends, a lot of them are Bernie people and aren't taking things well
Thanks for doing your part, especially given the current circumstances. Let's hope enough other like-minded people do the same!
Voted for Biden here a 9 am this morning. You go joe...
Fellow Floridian here. Also voted for Biden despite the fact that I was donating and working for Elizabeth Warren.
Were the line busy? Also do you have early voting?
How was your personal voter suppression today as one of the youngest voters? /sarcasm  Because apparently that's the reason Joe's winning.  https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/stop-blaming-young-voters-not-turning-out-sanders/608137/    Anyways congrats on voting and making your voice heard.
Zoomers for Joe! I’m excited this Zoomer will be casting my vote for Joe May 5th
I don't know what a zoomer is but I voted for him this morning as well. No one else was in the place!
Good job citizen!
Me too! At about 1:30 pm
What's a zoomer btw ?
Joe is a fucking chad
Why do you call him Diamond Joe?
Zoomers can vote? how old am i?
imagine voting for biden over sanders against trump.....
Some of each, but most of them either didn't affiliate with a party in time or weren't interested in the primary.
Helped what?
Go gators and go Joe!
>As a fellow Floridian who unfortunately voted way too early for Pete  Gah but at least you exercised your right to vote!
[removed]
Well my grandparents (80's) who are avid voters decided not to this time around to stay isolated, but that's mostly because the Republican ticket is guaranteed to go for Trump. Still, I could see a number of elderly moderate Dems not voting for the same reasons.
Thank you I was looking for these numbers!
Well I would guess that almost everyone but me in my polling station was 50 or older, but I live in a very elderly part of the state anyways.
Were mail in ballots easily available?
Haha, if you're salty about my username, take it up with 16 year old me for wanting to be edgy and ironic, but if you actually did look at my profile, you'd see that the most political I've really gotten is some Libertarian banter and sharing my thoughts on a few issues here and there. I did vote for Joe and the reason that I did was because he is clearly the most competent, economically moderate, socially liberal candidate in the running. He's left of what I would optimally want, which is someone like John Kasich, Weld, Bloomberg, or Walsh, but like a lot of people in the Biden camp, I'm here because my other options became unviable.
Bernie be non-viable in Florida would make my day!
Someone needs to create an epic 80s hair metal power ballad about the Joementum.
It was relatively busy, but no line when I got there. I do not have early voting, just voted normally on primary day.
The cognitive dissonance is astounding!
A zoomer is a way to jokingly/casually refer to someone from Gen-Z, someone born after 2000, in a similar manner to how people sometimes refer to the people from the baby boomer generation as "boomers."
It's reference to the satirical version of Joe Biden on The Onion.
Hey, I see you're here r/sandersforpresident and I know you don't like Biden, but since you came, why don't you take some time to look at Biden's policies and see how truly progressive he is. Just because he has a different medicare plan to Bernie doesn't mean he isn't progressive. I'd highly recommend reading into both democractic candidates so you're ready to vote blue ce November no matter who wins the primaries.
Ah so we can think of them like the part of the unemployment rate that doesn't count.  i.e. they weren't going to vote anyways.   I feel better about that.
Yeah, can't ever underestimate the closed-primary factor in Florida. I have a friend who recently moved down here, is officially now registered down here, but didn't make the deadline so she can't vote in the primary (and can't vote in the primary of her original state because she's now considered a Florida voter).
> Conservatives for Joe  Good to see people from the other side of the spectrum finding common cause and compromise. Votes like yours are what we'll need if the tankies sit this one out, which seems likely.  Mitt for VP? 😎
wrong and right  Go Vols (lol too bad they are garbage)!
The margin was only 1.2% in 2016 and Florida has seen one of the biggest drops in approval of Trump in the country. Coupled with Bidens popularity here among both Blacks and Hispanics, he could very easily win in November.
I mean it's Florida, it's not a guaranteed red state. Bernie would lose it very easily if he was the nominee. Biden has a fighting chance.
They also restored the voting rights of over 1 million felons since 2016. If even just a fraction voted for Joe, it could be the difference
Good to hear that they’re still turning out, though.
I don't mean to be salty, though I will admit I got kinda suspicious when I first noticed your name. But you didn't seem to be doing any "libtard" baiting here, so I got curious as to why. We really need to heal this country, and knowing what brought someone like you onboard is very helpful. Thank you for your very thoughtful response.   It's interesting that your journey to team Joe is very similar to mine, just from the opposite direction. I'm a progressive who supported Bernie in 2016. I went to one Sanders rally in very early 2019 and was underwhelmed this time around. I considered Warren for a minute, but just didn't feel like she could campaign effectively against Trump. Then I discovered Pete. His brand of pragmatic progressivism, and his campaign's Rules of the Road, really spoke to me. After Pete dropped out I voted for Sanders in California, but immediately regretted it. A Sanders presidency will do nothing but further polarize this already fractured nation. By the end of Super Tuesday it was clear that Joe is our best hope. I'm tired of purity tests and am happy to welcome Americans from all politcal backgrounds that want to help get this country back on track.  Welcome aboard. Thanks for your vote. Now let's win the era!
Honestly I was the same way I was 14 campaigning in 2016 making calls for Rubio and Todd Young but Todd Young is for cutting social security turned his back on Hoosiers and afraid to come back to Indiana and I became more progressive and democrat and it makes more sense glad to see the vote for Joe
Thank you.  Learn something new every day =)
One of my kids at school told me that because I'm a millennial, I'm therefor a Moomer.  I told him that a "moomer" sounds like a cow.  He said that cows have a certain dignity to them.  I was satisfied.
Loved those old onion pieces
don't worry, i follow this stuff very closely, and weigh my decisions accordingly. i wish you guys would do the same
I think we need to focus on bringing up turnout among those people who don’t turnout enough. It happened with Obama and to an extent, it happened to Trump. We need to capture that and ensure it’s permanent
If I had to guess at Biden's pick it might be Klobuchar, Harris, or Gretchen Whitmer, but idk. Anyways I've been part of Never Trump gang ever since he dissed my main men Kasich and Cruz (and was a complete bufoon on the white house for 4 years). I want someone competent back in office and Joe is the man with the plan.
Yes! That's the power of Joe Biden this cycle, he's bringing everyone together. Glad to have you on the same side.
The part you're missing is that we DID. We just came to a different conclusion than you. People can disagree with you without "they're clearly uneducated idiots who don't know anything about the material" being the deciding factor.
My bet is on Amy. But I really would like to see a "unity" ticket with someone from across the aisle.
> Gretchen Whitmer  This is my choice but guess we shall see!
We need to remember that at the end of the day we are all Americans. Glad to have you here.
That was a beautiful exchange.  Gives me hope.  Almost :)
Gabby Giffords: I’m proud to endorse @JoeBiden for President of the United States. After I was shot, Joe was there for me. And he's always been there for the gun safety movement. #GunSafetyPresident to do it again.
I also got an email blast from Giffords Pac! I have been supporting them for years and would suggest anyone else do the same as they made a big difference in the 2018 midterms by attacking NRA GOP congress.  >Anyone who knows Joe Biden knows he leads with his heart.  >He has the compassion and toughness to lead on gun safety. I’ve witnessed him comfort the survivors of gun violence, and I’ve seen him fight for solutions to gun violence — and win.  >That is why today I’m excited to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States. He is the best choice for a gun safety president.  >After I was shot, Joe was there for me. As I worked to recover and resume my public service, he was there for me then, too.  >As we’ve built a gun safety movement and campaigned to pass safer gun laws across America, Joe has been there with us.  >And as President, I know he will stand with the millions of Americans committed to fighting for gun safety.  >Joe Biden is the gun safety president we need in the White House. If you are with us, will you show your support today?  >We can trust Joe Biden to face Donald Trump and the NRA head on and win.  >We can trust him to build a nationwide movement that brings gun safety to the forefront and save lives.  >And we can trust him to make our communities and our families safer from gun violence.  >Now we just need to get out there and work our hardest to make sure he wins in November. I’m fired up and I hope you are too!  >My very best, Gabby
We'll make her proud.
Huge!! Gabby is a hero!!
Brady, Gabby, and Everytown/Moms Demand Action?  Not surprised given Bernie’s D- NRA grade, but I love to see it!!  Even if moderate Boomers are relatively pro-gun, Zoomers are not, and we need to bring them over to our side now.
IMO it would curb gun crime more to ban handguns and not long guns. There are a few high profile killings with long guns but the vast majority of gun crime, including Gabby's shooting are committed with handguns
Just googled her, what a brave soul!
Your AR-14s are soon to be history. Cherish them while you can, gun nuts.
For a moment I thought it was Sarah Palin from the thumbnail. LoL
GABBY!!!! She and Mark, an awesome team.
Guns should not be taken away
Is this ironic I can't tell anymore
We've passed 10,000 subscribers!!
All I've gotta say is-- to all of the folks who have come from other campaigns, it's been a real honor to have you all join us. All of your candidates ran incredible races, and from me to you-- thank you. We can win this together and finally beat Trump.  Y'all are amazing.
Yo I remember when this sub had 28 people.
I’m pretty sure when I joined a week ago there was like 2000? Am I wrong? Maybe 5k.
This is just the beginning!!  Let's go Joe!!!
Before 1k gang
This is all well and good but when are we bringing back the Biden Bro memes?
BIG TENT!
Malarkey officially almost extinct.
Look, I just hope he can win. I ain't a Biden supporter by any means but it's clear who the Democratic party wants. So I'll get on board up to and until we can defeat Trump.
I remember when this primary started, I joined the sub of every major candidate to keep up with everything. When I saw how few people were here, I thought I had found the wrong sub, so I kept searching for like Biden2020, DiamondJoe, BidenForPresident...nope. This was it! Glad I stayed and glad to see the numbers rising.
Damn when I joined 5 days ago there was about less than 5,000!
Gang gang
Welcome to the show!
Awesome!
I been so happy coming here from r poltics...the hell hole of sanders.
I’ll take our 10,000 over 1,000,000 when I’m pretty sure we vote at a higher proportion than other subs that think “upvotes” translate to actual “votes.” Wait until they find out it doesn’t actually work that way.
Weren't we at 5k two weeks ago?
It’s crazy that out of all the millions of people that vote, not that many are on Reddit.
What were we are like a month ago?
And relatively few of them are bot accounts!
We are here and it’s lit.
Finally! Yahoo!
We're going to need a lot more ice cream trucks here!
**T H E**      **J O E**      **T R A I N**
Just subscribed. It took Super Tuesday to remind me how much I admire Joe Biden. No matter how hard he gets knocked down, he always gets back up. That’s what we need to do.
r/JoeBiden is currently the 8th fastest growing sub in all of Reddit.
Is there a way to track the growth of a subreddit? Like a graph or something?
I wonder how many are bots paid for by your SuperPACs.
Go Joe Go!
[removed]
To be honest, how many ratio do you think Biden wins in the election with Sander, and with Trump?
I officially echo this!
Join Us!
Thank you guys for offering a welcoming spirit and a sense of belonging, both virtually and in real life.  When I was campaigning for Pete in SC, I often ran into Biden's organizers, supporters, and volunteers at events and even when canvassing- everyone was always cordial and respectful. Never an unkind word toward Pete, me campaigning for him, or any other campaign. That helped me get on board pretty quickly.
Thanks for the welcome!  I was a casual Amy supporter but would’ve always supported Uncle Joe as the nominee!
In it to win it baby!
I think I joined when this sub had like 800 people. The growth has been nuts.
Lol when was this?  I remember months ago it was just 4k.
It was sub 5K when I joined, I joined the day Pete dropped out.
It was like 4k the day before pete dropped out
Be the change you want to see in the sub.
We are asking that memes posted here stay positive and Biden-specific. For other memes you can post to /r/MalarkeyBus or /r/BidenBro (not too active though but it would be good to get going.) I think we are trying to set up /r/Malarkey as an official meme outlet.
Look, I know you are getting downvoted here - but if you really will suck it up and vote for Biden to get Trump out - *thank you.* Genuinely.
Same. I'm not a Biden voter but I sure as fuck will be in November. Glad to see this sub is growing, it has a nice atmosphere.
I read this in Bad Bunny's voice.
As Joe surges so do we ✊😎✊
Or are not on Reddit for politics.
like 3k.
Lmao
Welcome!
8th fastest growth as a percentage of total subscribers, for what it's worth. Not fastest-growing by total new subscribers.
Yeah go to subredditstats.com  I did. Its ridiculous. This place was sub 4k the night of sc
Well, against Trump the latest polls are all somewhere in the range of 50-40 or 53-43 etc.   As for against Sanders..............538 currently gives Sanders a 0.1% chance of beating Biden in the primary.
Thanks, Janet Yellen's fuckboy.
I joined this sub when there were 55 people, and half of them were trolls.
I got in at 1600.
Months ago when he first entered.
Doubling in a week ain’t too shabby
Yeah, I joined ST and it was 4k and change.
/r/bidenbro needs to be re-established. it's been getting better but was kinda brigaded by malarkey.
We’ve got to get one and only one going or to allow this place to be home to memes because memes are an essential part of driving online enthusiasm whether we like of or not.
For real, can we please *not* downvote people just for being unenthusiastic Biden voters? A vote for our man Joe has the same value regardless of how excited the person casting it is.
Oh yeah, for sure. Still nice though:)
You’re welcome Greg r
I've heard some of the mods are Trump supporters.
Are you suggesting there should be only one major Biden meme sub or only one Biden centric sub (so this one should include ALL memes, negative or otherwise)?
Either one Biden centric sub, or just one meme sub. I remember back in 2016 /r/HillaryClinton banned memes and people went off to random places and the enthusiasm just petered out.
I agree. Bring memes that don't fit here to /r/MalarkeyBus!

I regret sending my mail-in ballot so early because now I can't change it, but alas. I'll take my White House like I like my coffee mug, full of Joe.
Shoutout to everyone tweeting [#PetetoBernie](https://twitter.com/theneedledrop/status/1234366324681453568?s=09) yesterday doing their best surprised Pikachu impressions now.
Joementum is real.
Word is he's going to do it at a rally in Dallas, TX.  :D
Pete ran a great campaign and has a bright political future...his endorsement will be much appreciated...
Yes! Former Pete now on team Joe. Was a day one supporter and kinda bummed, but I know that Biden is best for the country, and has the experience to get it done.   Let's do this!!!!
Congrats from a Bernout lol  These are very strong endorsements and Sander's chances are built on a strong Super Tuesday, so he's basically done bc he can't unify the progressive vote even. The party will never get behind him when theres a strong moderate choice, which Biden will absolutely be, prolly very high with delegates too.  ggwp
Team Pete dude here who has not yet voted (thanks to Florida not being a Super Tuesday state). I'm all in for Joe Biden!
Details! I need more details!
Sweet jayzuz, could the day get any better. Thank you, Pete!
After pitching some money a few times into Pete's campaign, I got an email from him with a link to donate to Joe's campaign. Made me sniffle a bit.  But I did pitch a few bucks into Joe's campaign!
Watching Pete speak now in Dallas. Ever so eloquent and connecting with the audience.
Here from Team Pete. Get in the car. We are going to beat trump like a drum!
Heartbroken Pete supporter here. I will follow Pete anywhere, including to Biden’s campaign. Hi guys!  I don’t know as much about him as I should given he was VP for 8 years, but if Leslie Knope loved him, how bad could he be? (S/....kinda) He also appears to be embracing Pete so that’s a win for me.   Now tell me why you love Biden!
Beto O'Rourke too!! Biden is gonna win TX in an upset!!
Anyone have a link? I can't find it online.
This definitely makes the Florida primary an easier call for me. Whoever had the best shot between Pete and Amy was going to get my vote; and once they both dropped out, it was clear the move was to support Biden against a Sanders nomination.
[deleted]
There might be a number you can call to fix an error on your ballot. At least in CA
yeah, this is a kick in the pants to good early voters who are trying to do the right thing.  oh well.
What state? I just watched the Sec of State of MA say on TV that mailed in ballots that have not been recorded yet are retrievable. It's difficult though.
Same thing happened here in Colorado.
[deleted]
For real! They're all endorsing Joe!
Him and Kolbachar are going to endorse together as a show of unity.
[deleted]
Thanks for your support, glad to have you with us! It stings now I'm sure but Pete ran a hell of a campaign. No one cash take away from him all he accomplished, maybe most significantly being the first openly gay candidate to win a primary (caucus,whatever lol). He was never my first choice but I was closeto him in policy and ideology, and find him very impressive to her him speak. When he said in a recent debate that w need to wake up as a party or Wed end up stick choosing between Bloomberg and Sanders, and how most people don't know where they fit with those optionsand how we shouldn't have to choose between someone who wants to burn theparty down and someonewho wants to but the party out, I was thoroughly impressed. I'm sure buttigeig has a brought future ahead of him and that he will continue to serve this country as he always has.
I'm from the EU, and don't understand the hype behind Biden, why would he be better for the country than Bernie?  Is it because he is a socialist? All the things Bernie is campaigning for seem totally normal in the country I live.
Thanks friend!  Remember the end game is beating Trump. Even if it looks ugly the race right now, we have to be together later!
Sanders is still super solid according to FiveThirtyEight. I honestly have no idea who's going to win, but it's almost certainly going to be between him and Biden.
Thanks for the kind words, friend. Anyone who is willing to work together to make this country and our world better is always welcomed here!
Welcome to the team!
Right here:  https://twitter.com/mviser/status/1234560424768569344
I think Pete has a bright future in US politics. I look forward to keeping my Pete 2020 buttons for when he’s elected President a few years down the road.
Wait, I think it didn't start for 40 more minutes. Is it streaming anywhere?
I'm almost there...
This is what pretty much all moderates were thinking.  Or anyone connected enough to the real world to know that America will never elect a self-described socialist to the Presidency.
?
Michigan has a procedure for this as well.
I checked my ballot status (WA), already processed and they specifically state at that point it is locked in even if your candidate drops
Just relaying what is above in case you missed it but some states have ways you can recall your ballot. I know Michigan does at least.
Not snarky I promise. Why is early voting the right thing?
WA, unfortunately they make it clear that it is irrevocable
Yeah, that wasn't going to happen.  But some Pete supporters will shift their votes to Bernie. And some to Warren and some to Bloomberg. The important thing in the end is the percentages, of course, and I'm not sure anyone knows that, though there have been polls.  I read an article I can't find now, and it was saying something about how in South Carolina Biden was voted for over Bernie out of those who prefer Medicare for All. It maybe that there are other ideological factors that drew them to Biden, or may be that it was non-ideological factors, or they could just really be uninformed on issues and voting on momentum or looks or name recognition or whatever.
Sweet buttery biscuits!!  Let's hope that this is enough to sway people tomorrow.
I really really hope pete and Amy can truly bury the hatchet and not continue to hate each other behind the scenes.
I kinda want to see a Biden fundraiser that's a fight between Pete and Amy. Amy gets binders to throw to give her an edge, Pete can call in Chasten.
And now Beto is in too!
What?
Yes thank you!!
Hi and welcome from Europe! So lets get down to it ...... Sanders doesn't appeal to most democrats let alone the country. He is very all or nothing and won't compromise to work with republicans, which is needed to get legislation passed. Everything Bernie says sounds great, but won't get done becuase it is too radical for most democrats, independants, and republicans. His policies will hurt the middle class and small businesses,  and scare investment. Biden is building a strong winning coalition while Bernie leaves little room for others that don't pass his purity tests.
Exactly, can't let what happened in 2016 be repeated. Third party candidates are a nono and high turnout is key.
I do wonder how the Bloomberg factor plays in. And Warren.  And hey, I just remembered, Tulsi Gabbard is still running. Someone should tell her, she may have forgotten since it doesn't really come up much in the news.
https://www.livenewsnow.com/american/msnbc.html
That’s what blows my mind. He’s not really a socialist- he’s more a social democrat. I get that socialism is a spectrum. However, if you want to model your government after the Nordic model, you have to understand they support highly regulated capitalism with a strong welfare state.
How does that work? I thought once a vote was cast, that's it.
clears up the line for election day.  A lot of people will just drive by and if the line is too long will skip it.  There are a lot of mildly interested voters that won't wait hours in line.    Republicans love long lines....their elderly base have nothing better to do.  People with multiple jobs, kids, etc don't.
It’s not by any means. I don’t know what this guy is talking about
Glad I waited. I would have wasted my vote.
> I read an article I can't find now, and it was saying something about how in South Carolina Biden was voted for over Bernie out of those who prefer Medicare for All.  It depends on how the question was worded. I like medicare for all, but I just don't see how we could jump to it immediately wants to try to do. So, I support candidates that have proposed a more graduated approach (I've been a Warren fan, but, ya know). Biden also has the plus of having worked on Obamacare, and the plan that goes through is better than the plan that doesn't.  So, personally, I can easily see voting for Biden even if you like medicare for all.
ha ha ha sweet buttery biscuits indeed ...
I dont think its mutual, I think Amy just hates Pete.
Replied to wrong message lmao
Bernie still has a formidable ground game.  We’re riding pretty high over here right now, but I think most of us still know this going to be drawn out.   Key is that we all make up again after July.  I’m “Blue No Matter Who”.  Even if it’s Sanders making the prime time convention speech.
Thanks!
It's not about the policy or the nuance.  It's about the LABEL.  Democrats are so much smarter than Republicans, except when it comes to electoral strategy and then they are fucking stupid. It's marketing 101. You don't slap a label on yourself that is deeply unpopular.
[See here](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/02/michigan-absentee-voters-can-spoil-ballot-get-new-one-if-candidate-drops-out/4929708002/), it’s similar to the other states listed where it depends on your ballot not yet being processed.
Interesting take—thanks!
Happy Cake Day marle217! Don't be pushed around by the fears in your mind. Be led by the dreams in your heart.
I agree, just didn’t want to single out Amy since we’re trying to unify
I agree, but Pete has reason to be angry too considering if not for Amy he may have decisively won IA and potentially won NH which could have things looking very different right now.     I hope a show of unity between them boost solidarity tomorrow.
You bet.
Actually, it's more than the label.  There's video of Bernie in the 1980s supporting communist regimes, at a time we were at war with them. Republicans would have dumped that in October and the entire Democratic party would have been obliterated across the board.
While I agree that if not for Amy, Pete would have won N.H., I don’t think that’s something he can be mad at her about. She was trying to win, just like him.
Absolutely agree.  I'm not saying he doesn't *understand* it, just that it's hard not to have it in the back of your head that it happened that way.

BETO!!!  I knew it he will endorse Biden, after Veronica Escobar did so earlier today.
The news just keeps getting better and better!
Texas is Biden country?
Hopefully this is the push needed to win TX confidently and keep Biden inching up in CA and elsewhere.
Rose Twitter gettin' thornier!
🔥 J O E M E N T U M 🔥
This is freaking huge! Texas is Beto country and if Beto himself is on board a lot of people are going to follow.
BLESS UP 💎
Where is Kamala Harris ???  Maybe we can get Maya Rudolph to show up in Texas and pretend to be Kamala endorsing Joe
$25 recurring donation has been moved from Pete to Biden let's fucking do this!
YES
Omg so amazing!!!
Very happy about this. I was just feeling abandoned by him when another poster kindly explained to me Beto has also been helping down ballot candidates.
I hope this boost Biden, we need to get a huge lead in Texas to compensate for Bloomberg,
Beto was my first choice way back when. I already found my way to Joe, but it's great to see the endorsement!
True to form!
So many endorsements today. I really hope this will reflect in Super Tuesday.
By this point I was thinking he would just sit out the primary.  This is an unexpected surprise!
This is what swayed me away from voting Bernie tomorrow.
Always loved me some Beto. He's going to be invaluable at the grassroots level.
Hell yeah!  Beto is awesome!!
He ned to run for texas senate....but thanks beto
It's expected that Warren and Bloomberg will endorse Biden as well, right? If that's the case then this should be an easy win for Biden.
IT'S SUPER TUESDAY AND I'M READY TO VOTE FOR JOE IN TEXAS! And then grab some Whataburger!
I'm having a tough time with Biden saying that he'll have Beto "take care of the gun problem."  I was originally for Biden until he started pushing his gun control platform and moved my support to  Buttigieg.  After Pete dropped out I was again leaning to Biden.  Now not so much.  I will never, ever support Sanders or Trump.  As a democrat who also supports Second Amendment rights I'm screwed.  If Biden dropped the anti-firearm rhetoric he could get a lot more support which he needs to beat Sanders.
Very close with a [slight Biden lead](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/texas/) now according to 538. Hopefully this pushes Biden towards a clear win tomorrow.
I actually think he can beat Trump in Texas, which makes a Trump victory impossible and would have some pretty crazy ramifications for the GOP.
I hope there's enough time for them to see this, though.
Rumor has it she's endorsing tomorrow. Since she's THE big one (other than Obama himself, but he's made it clear that he doesn't want to be seen influencing the primary race, since former presidents by tradition don't endorse), they might want to wait until the morning so as not to dilute her influence in this already huge crop of endorsements.
I'm glad👍👍
thank you! bring friends and family
he means adding background checks beto said that a few secs earlier
> Hopefully this pushes Biden towards a clear win tomorrow.  Gotta hope for a good night!
Trump is still +2.6 over Biden in Texas according to the RCP average.  That might not seem like a lot, but remember that Trump is the most divisive president in history and has the lowest favorability ratings and he’s still winning in Texas.   It’s still a very red state but it’s becoming more purple every election cycle.  And Democrats have legitimate shot of flipping the state legislature.   Trump will win Texas in 2020.  But the GOP is definitely anxious about what can happen in 2024, 2028 and 2032.
>I actually think he can beat Trump in Texas,   Totally agree!
I dunno, wouldn't it make more sense to endorse the night before to maximize the amount of people who hear about it? We're all kinda biased around here, we hear of news/endorsements the literal minute they come out, but think about all the folks who don't follow too closely and go by what they happen to hear on the radio/tv etc...
Unless something has changed Beto's policy is way beyond background checks.  He very vocally and proudly proclaimed "Hell yes I'm coming for them" or something similar.
The thing is that's +2.6 is without even campaigning or spending any serious resources in the state. Texans likes being able to touch their politican and if Biden's spends serious time/resources and actually treats it like a battleground state he can definitely move that needle.  And honestly, the right VP pick with an army of volunteers behind him couldn't hurt either.
But also a very good economy. If, god forbid, something happens to the economy between now and the election, I think the EC gains will be astonishing.
Agree. But I do think Joe can flip FL, and flipping FL is almost as much of  a game changer as much as TX. If he flips FL, all he needs to do is flip MI (which is likely) and hang on to VA & NV...and it's a narrow victory for Dems. Also, in head to head polls there's a more than decent shot Joe has at NC, again, and PA...and possibly even AZ. Even if he lost FL and most of the rustbelt except IL/MI/MN, NC & PA guarantee a win.
The most important state is Georgia though.  It has 2 senate seats up for election and we need to win at least 1 of them if we are gonna flip the senate.  If we can't flip the senate, the GOP will block everything, win in 2022 and then we lose the house as well.
True, which is why I wish Stacey would try for the Senate.
So I see someone added Yang...
Noo beto dont touch ur face
Badass
Fuck yea! The YangGang thanks whoever the creator of this poster is! <3
Resolution is better but we need HIGHER RESOLUTION
Y'all made Obama look like Mufasa up there... lol
Form this Democrats primary, Pete stood out for me. I am already excited for 2024.
Someone please make this a t shirt
Amazing meme.
Storm Shadow?
Yang looks a tad uncomfortable. Like his underwear is riding up, but he cannot readjust himself because he is in public. Booker looks most action movie with his posture and expression.
😍A multiracial, multigenerational coalition😍
Where the hell is Daddy Delaney?
Still no warren.
Gangs all here
Once Warren gets onboard, we need to add the slogan, "Dream Big, Fuck Hard, and Win!"
That guy on the bottom right with his hand on his face is giving me anxiety
'We're getting the band back together'
This makes me happy
You’re gonna need a bigger picture. Soon he’ll have too many endorsers to fit the screen haha
THANK YOU!!!!!
I understand that my (left) politics are different from the median position on this board. But do you really want to celebrate Mike Bloomberg's endorsement? Because his whole existence in this election cycle is demonstrative of what is "insane" about our politics.
I passionately love this.
Much-needed
Ok y obama tho
This thing cracks me up every time I see it.
Joe is gonna have one helluva administration, super stars galore.
Yang backed sanders didn't he?
[removed]
Cuz Corona?
Be like Pete. Arms down awkwardly at side.
That's honestly my biggest issue too, I saw the Yang version pop up on FB without the totally shit resolution of the Booker one and went "I HAVE TO MAKE SURE REDDIT GETS THIS"
I expect big things from Pete in the near future - he ticks all the boxes.
Better yet, an actual poster.
My thoughts exactly, lol.  And since I’m Asian, I guess I get a pass about stereotyping, I hope.
Booker looks the most like an action movie character with his posture, and expression, and dating an action movie character.
And Deval Patrick!
In time. Waiting until it’s over and endorsing works good enough for me.
Beto.
>do you really want to celebrate Mike Bloomberg's endorsement?  The Bernie talking point that anything a billionaire does or says is bad is not one of his better ones.  The *existence* of the billionaire class is undoubtedly bad for our society, but individual billionaires are in fact people, and can have both good and bad points, and can do good as well as bad.  Bloomberg has plenty of bad points, both as a politician and as a person, but he did plenty of good as mayor of NYC, and had many supporters there, pretty much across the political spectrum as far as I've seen...he didn't align well with any particular political party.  His presidential run was by all accounts a failure, but I've seen plenty of people saying they support him, and if his endorsement can nudge them into Joe's camp, yes, that's a good thing...
I wasn’t rooting for Bloomberg in any way, but especially now that he’s out, I can appreciate what (I think) he was trying to do. He sees a rich guy get elected President via a disinformation campaign, and he thinks, “I’m more rich, and can make a more convincing ad and beat him at his own game to win the country back.”  He’s bankrolled multiple campaigns for other people and feels his money is ultimately the reason they got elected. He had that slip in the 7th (?) debate about how he “bought” Congressmen. He sees this spending as using the power he has to put people in positions of authority who will speak against Trump.  I am quite clearly idealistic, but when it was announced that he’s hired people to put together nepotism ads about Trump’s kids that he will only release if Trump starts a disinformation campaign against Biden’s kid, I felt validated. I think he’s trying to do something good here, and may have a very important part yet to play.
I'm celebrating Mikes warchest and media machine focused on attacking Trump.
Yeah it’s bonkers to celebrate him. Though I get in this circumstance he’s kind of like Tony Stark. Everyone knows he’s a rich asshole who doesn’t know why everyone hates him but also his suit *will* help destroy the enemy.
He also just donated $2 million to help get disenfranchised black folks registered for November.  Money can do good things too.
He endorsed Joe after the math became obvious that he would be the nominee.
He backed Sanders in 16 never this year
Begone, Russian bot
You're foo of shit
Yeah
I think he has his hands in his pockets
We need yang gang on this!
Like this!   Sir Patrick Stewart vs Mayor Pete Buttigieg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBRqQ78U3Pk&feature=youtu.be
if his arms were shown he would be holding a gun at us.
And Wayne Messam!
It's enough that she hasn't endorsed Sanders, either.
Yeah just sad she always waits until it means nothing to take a stand on a foregone conclusion
The problem with bloomberg (at least in my opinion) is not that he is a billionaire, but that he got as far as he did purely by spending an insane amount of money. Money that no non-billionaire candidate could possibly afford. This demonstrates that with enough money, it may be possible to buy an election which I'm sure you'll agree, is a bit undemocratic.
Ahhh kay so thats a thing.
[removed]
I don’t think it means nothing. Her endorsement will be important in party unification.
Let the woman use her political capital however she damn pleases. I was never on team Warren but the woman did not run for president so she could play handmaiden to Bernie or Biden.  Warren owes nothing to Bernie and nothing to Biden. Maybe she is holding her endorsement for good reason or better timing or to get policy concessions or to get a seat at the table and we can all just chill. She already did Biden a massive favor and I thank her.
Endorsement is not a simple gesture. Behind the scene, generally there would be a discussion / negotiation with the winning campaign before endorsement is made. I imagine Warren would like Joe's agreement to adopting a few of her stances on issues.
Steyer is a better example of what you're talking about. Bloomberg is a well known politician. Lots of people appreciate his moderate record.  The problem is that certain leftists demonize people with money and act like it is not possible for them to be good. You might as well substitute 'homosexuals' or 'jews' and their Agenda into their rants. Pragmatists aren't looking for Jesus; politics doesn't get done by purists. For instance, when Bernie tried to compromise and endorse Hillary, he lost followers who complained he was corrupt now. But compromise is the only way people got the things Sanders wanted in other countries.
Oh, I totally agree, this represents a significant problem with our system, which needs to be fixed.  Bloomberg certainly wouldn't have done even as well as he did without the big bucks.  Nonetheless, he actually does appeal to some people (I've seen him mentioned a bunch of times recently in this sub), and I think we should accept them along with everybody else that's uniting under Joe.  This is a time for unity and acceptance, not score settling...
And before that afaik he refused to back anyone. He said he'd only endorse someone who A backed UBI or B was sure to win the nom.
shoo troll.
She's also a sitting Senator in the midst of a virtually unprecedented public health crisis. She's got way more important shit going on than playing a minor role in the waning stages of the primary.
Thank you for saying this.
She is using her capital POORLY... what little she had is dwindling fast in the wake of pandemic ... if she endorses Biden today she’s then on the team that will defeat trump and implement competent government that minimizes crises like these.  So I’m NOT saying she owes anyone anything.  I’m saying she’s making a bad political choice that MINIMIZES her influence ... if she waits until after Florida and the polling in Florida is correct, she will then go to joe and say, “hey joe, I want to give you my endorsement but can you give me x, y, and z?”   joes then gonna smile and say “gosh Elizabeth where were you two weeks ago when we really needed you on the team? We’ve wrapped this up. We no longer need you.”  And ya know... if she then has a fit and endorses bernie after Florida she might as well file as an independent and count any chance at senate majority leader out the window.  As you’ve argued she is free to do what she wants, and owes no one anything ... I agree 100%.  But she has some capital now   After Florida and Georgia she will have none at all. And will just look silly on the sidelines.
She might be waiting for Bernie so that it can be a 'total' progressive wing endorsement; it shows solidarity among Democrats and ensures that every progressive knows that the leadership is united. Warren doing it solo might sour some Sanders supporters view of her as well, and so by waiting it prevents infighting on the left.
Personally I hope she's fighting for her any corruption policies behind the scenes. Of all her policies, those are the most needed for the long term health of America
So true ... also true she has more power now than she will after Florida and Georgia primaries.   If polling is correct, after the next few primaries, joe won’t need her endorsement ... as of this moment he would appreciate her help.
Are you saying biden can outmanouvre trump?
Thanks for the reply. With all due respect, you have no idea what is best for Elizabeth Warren and neither do I. You do not know what is really happening and neither do I but you are certain you know what is best for Warren. I doubt you are a political expert, and I know I am not. So here we have people on the internet, me and you, wildly speculating and who believe they know more about politics and her own career than Warren. She has earned the right to do whatever she wants.   I think we can both agree she is a smart woman and can make her own decisions. She should do what benefits herself and her career in my opinion.
And now it turns out Warren was negotiating for policy concessions about bankruptcy laws. So what do you think now? Did she make a mistake waiting to endorse or did she wait to help fellow Americans by getting some of the policies she champions into the Biden administration?
New Biden ad: "Negative ads will only help Donald Trump. It's time we bring our party together!"
The stuff that the Bernie campaign has been saying via text messages is absurd. They say that Biden wants to destroy social security and make sure no one has healthcare. They are being totally dishonest and I am glad that Biden is calling them out.
As Michelle Obama once said,"When they go low, we go high!"
no more malarkey!
What a great ad. I’ll never forget the same thing occurring in 2016 and not enough fighting back against the malarkey. Joe is all the wiser from having seen the playbook from 2016.
Biden has the luxury of not having to go negative on Bernie. It’s also smart as hell. Bernie’s attacking like crazy over social security and it’s a bad look.
Bring on more like this.
Smart ad. Targeting the population that votes and spreading a message of unity against Trump.
Great ad. Exactly what we needed right now. Glad to see more ads coming now that some more money is coming in.
I love this ad, and I love the message of unity.  I also love this sub.  My Facebook newsfeed is an echo chamber of angry Berniebusters, so I've been staying off of Facebook.
I really like Bernie to be honest. I used to be a supporter. But I have been dismayed by the rhetoric. Also he has done little to nothing to really put a stop to the extremes in his base of support. It's one of the reasons that when super Tuesday came I could not in good conscience vote for him. I do like Bernie in general but we need someone who can cool the vitriol and bring some normalcy back to the country.
I just checked twitter and Bernie people are definitely not trying to unite.  \#HellNoJoe trending with almost 30k tweets , Bernie folks talking cash shit about Biden
When they go low, we go high
He saw what BS did to Clinton in 2016 and it caused a large chunk of the population to stay home or vote for Stein.     You know Tulsi Gabbard is going to run in the Fall.
I love this!!!!
This is also a handy ad because it manages to sneakily remind everyone how much Joe is winning by. I'm here for the stealth play at the "people who vote for whoever's in the lead" demographic, tbh.  Like, might not be as feel good, but from a political strategy pov? Gotta respect it.
The scary thing about Bernie's campaign is that most of his attacks on the Clintons were recycled by Trump's. He did more harm than good by repeating the same stump speech about NAFTA that ended up making Trump look smarter than he is to the Rust Belt.
Oh no... is this a negative ad about Bernie's negative ads?  What if Bernie releases a negative ad about this ad?
Joe might be running one of the first presidential campaigns that is completely honest and truthful. I couldn't say that about the other guy who's running!
Poison the well with rainbows!
Oh lord
I gotta say, if this is his best response to the problems brought up in the ads he's in trouble. Trump is going to be hitting him on his record the same way he did Clinton, he needs to decide how to respond and dodging the question by saying that even bringing up Biden's record is helping Trump is a weak response. Biden's record is the biggest reason I don't support him and this type of response makes me even less inclined to change my mind
They are basically turning into the left version of Trump
And wtf is with Bernie people getting everyone phone numbers and texting them ? Is that even legal ?
[removed]
This is the main reason why Bernie lost my support years ago. When he started out, he seemed to be running the most positive campaign in among a mess of negativity.   2020 Bernie has been a campaign of toxicity and lies. (2016 Bernie probably was too, but I was paying less attention then).   I have made a lot of incorrect predictions, but one prediction that I was right about was that Sanders would have less support in 2020 than he did in 2016. I figured this would be a combination of the Democrats running stronger alternatives this time and more people waking up to the fact that Bernie is not the honest man fighting for the working class everyone thought he was. I’m glad that I was right.
Yeah, this is just sad and unacceptable. I would have thought they would be better than that. The worst they can do is try to say that those are the things Trump and the GOP are going to go after. But its completely unrealistic to believe Joe or any of the democratic candidates would do such things.  At least this can serve as a training ground for the general election where Trump and the GOP will do this x100.
Biden wants to destroy Social Security! Yang is secretly trying to destroy social welfare!  I think this stuff is projection from the actual socialists backing him who hope he'll be a socialist trojan horse.
[removed]
Can I get a specific example? Because what I've seen is them saying he's supported and called for freezing and/or cutting Social Security (which is absolutely true) and that his healthcare plan maintains the status quo (which isn't true but his plan doesn't significantly reform our broken system so I see where they're coming from)
Wow, simply not true.  Where do you guys get this from?  I am getting texts from the Bernie campaign left and right.  It only talks about Biden's record and yes much of it was good but a lot of it sucked.  Crime Bill, social security etc.
Then why did he in 2018 campaign for a guy who belongs to the party that wants to cut social security  https://m.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2019/01/23/new-york-times-joe-biden-campaigned-for-michigan-republican-ahead-of-midterms  Seriously how is this acceptable for any candidate and why are these things not allowed to be discussed in debates  Edit: i wonder how far this gets downvoted with zero responses explaining how its ok. Look inward, guys. This will come out in the general.
[removed]
When they go low, we vote for Joe.
Biden/Obama 2020
When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them.
Biden should pick Duckworth as VP so she can kick the crap out of Trump and Pence when they go low.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5iRvUK5A0U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5iRvUK5A0U)   I'd like to think that Stone went all out to kill Franken's career because the GOP was scared of a female nominee picking him as VP. He would have destroyed Pence in a debate like Biden did with Ryan.
That worked in 2016, just saying.
tbh I think Bernie is getting desperate because he knows he's in big trouble  his supporters are slowly starting to also figure that out
Lol. Just gotta find your own echo chamber
Adception.
Trump has his own record to worry about.
They turned 4 years ago. We forgot about it.
I mean - they’ve always been that....
[removed]
Yes. They are numbers from public voter registration plus Bernie supporters giving the campaign their friends’ info. That’s pretty typical campaign behavior.
When I texted for Pete we were told to tell people who asked (iirc) that the lists came from the secretary of state voter registration lists. Those are considered public record, you don't even need to be a politician running for office to check them.
Legal or not, they are so obnoxious.  A family member received a text message asking if they were going to vote for Bernie. They said "No." and the immediate response was "Why not?"  No, we are not having a dialogue with a suspicious, random phone number pushing for a conversation we don't want to have.  It turned this person off to Bernie completely.
No, every campaign has access to that information. Did you not get calls from bloomberg?
All campaigns do this, it's normal
[removed]
I was in the Hillary campaign, it was just like this. Some of the Bernie Bros were actually conservative plants, designed to make them look bad and sow toxicity. However, some was because Bernie is not good at managing. He hires people who are vicious. He gets nasty and accuses people of 'rigging' things against him when its pretty obvious the moderates don't care for him.   Looking at his recent paid advocates, I'm struck by how slimy they seem. Compare his people to Warren's people, who have similar politics.
Bernie Sanders has done absolutely zero to bring healthcare to the US. While every other rich country covered their citizens and Joe fought for a public option, Bernie renamed post offices.  The US would already have all of  these things if it had more Joe Bidens and fewer Bernies.  Other countries have more Bidens and fewer Bernies. The Bernies and Ron Pauls have set the US back 40 years.
Biden has specifically said that he will protect Social Security. Bernie is claiming that Biden will cut it because Biden has *discussed* whether it might be cut in past budget discussions. He has not cut it and the video that Shaun King posted was full on fraudulent. Biden was saying NOT to cut it but King doctored the video to say the opposite.   His healthcare plan is universal healthcare. The Bernie people are saying that anything short of nationalizing the entire healthcare system is bad. It's just not true that nationalizing the entire healthcare system is necessary to cover everyone. Every other rich country covers everyone and none of them have such an expensive and complicated plan as what Bernie is offering.
This article is disingenuous.  He wasn’t campaigning for anybody.  He was paid to give a speech at the Economic Club of Southwest Michigan to open their 75th season.  He mostly talked about reclaiming American values and briefly praised Upton as a good guy for his work supporting cancer research funding.  This is not campaigning for anybody, this is actually what Joe does best, refuses to demonize people and calling for a culture of belonging where we can disagree on things but work together to advance important ideas that benefit all of us.
Is this supposed to be a bad look? Many people are voting for him because he can be a unifier and work across the aisle to get things done, instead of promising unrealistic things and being tribal. Apparently having a connection with any Republican is a terrible thing these days. Purity tests only get you so far.  Edit: Why should anybody be worried about this coming out in the general? Trump: “Joe Biden decided to work with us, the party who wants to cut social security. We cannot allow this type of working across the aisle in the White House.”
It won't come out in the general though.  Plenty of us support individual republicans, knowing we don't perfectly align with their beliefs. Outside of extremists, this is very common. I wish we had more Murkowski's and less Bernie's, for instance.

“There will be no compromise on cutting Medicare and Social Security, period. That’s a promise,” -Biden 2020  Also, you know that 1995 balanced budget bill you were talking about? It never mentioned Social Security once   https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-joint-resolution/1/text  Even so, that was 25 years ago. It’s impossible someone can change their political views over time?
Technically a former pres could be VP...it’s constitutional! Terrible idea though :-p or you meant Michelle, that’s cool too
Which one?
I think a lot of his supporters know their turnout issue is problematic for them. Many also seem to know losing Michigan would be hard to come back from.
I live with alt right Republicans! A nice friendly bubble is a relief from real life. 😄
We must go deeper
"My opponent released an unfair characterization of my ad about his ad about my ad about his ad about my ad about his ad about..."  Hey, somebody's got to fill up the airwaves with Bloomberg out.
Sure but that doesn't excuse Biden. Trump pointing out Biden's record will hurt turnout if he can't refute his criticism.

Lies and ugliness are still lies and ugliness, regardless as to who it benefits.
The constant false smear attacks. We've dealt with four years of this with Trump, the American people don't want another four years of it from Bernie.
Zero people mind about you being *passionate*
>Is being passionate about a politician bad?  Strictly speaking, I’d say it is in the context we’re describing. When you’re so passionate about a politician you’d literally spread lies about their opponents, it’s a toxic passion.
Forgot Bernie's campaign was big on "sign up your friends so we can contact them too".
I see ,not really a big fan of that , just my opinion
Right ? Heck I wouldn’t even want a text from someone’s I  was voting for lol. We had enough political adds on tv and YouTube and social networks ,can at lest my text message box be safe ?
I did get one call from Bloomberg. Bernie on the other hand has been calling me almost every day for several months, all because they were able to pressure me into donating a year ago. I finally blocked the number. I also keep getting texts from them even after I told them I'm not interested.   No one else has called or texted me.
I see , but no only from Bernie I get the text and I’m not even a Democrat
[removed]
But can you provide a direct example of him saying Joe is planning on cutting Social Security? He's saying Joe called for cuts in the past, which is true. It's not just one video, there are countless videos of him saying we need to freeze social security. A public option is not Universal Healthcare, and Bernie's plan is directly based off that of Denmark and Sweden. It's really not that complicated.
They ran ads with joe biden touting bipartisan support from this speech, and they won. That's campaigning. He needs to do better. Do not help the opponents.  He, personally thought "I will praise this republican for $200,000 even though I do not have to" and then they ran ads on it and won. Either he did this on purpose, or doesn't understand politics at all. Which is it?
Do we need more republicans in the house or less? Because he looked at this guy and said "more republicans"
[removed]
It’s simply not fair to say Bernie got nothing accomplished in 30 years.   He did get a post office renamed.    https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-applauds-house-vote-on-the-renaming-of-the-danville-post-office
This is a very inaccurate take, to be generous. Joe campaigned saying he wants to cut those programs for year and years. It's only recently that became unpopular and he doesn't do that anymore. That's 100% fair game.
>Even so, that was 25 years ago. It’s impossible someone can change their political views over time?  Yeah, this really bothers me about the Joe attacks. I hear it with his record on gay rights as well. But to me, I don't care what opinion you held in the 80s, or even a few years ago. I care about your current opinions, because people are allowed to grow and change. Hell, that's exactly what we want in this country right now. Why put down someone who has come over to the right side of history? Doesn't that discourage others from doing the same?  (Questions are rhetorical, not aimed at you)
No. A VP must be eligible to be president. So AOC is off the table, as are B. Obama, G. W. Bush, and B. Clinton
Michelle! I'm okay to settle for Barack ruling America from the shadows.
Michelle I think
Michelle
>I think a lot of his supporters know their turnout issue is problematic for them. Many also seem to know losing Michigan would be hard to come back from.    They're getting the numbers they expected. All the way back in April they were planning on coasting to the convention on 30% with several other candidates fighting for the other 70%.     When Biden/Pete/Amy joined forces, they effectively neutered Sander's campaign strategy which had already figured that youth turnout wasn't going to happen.
Anyone who permits Trump to stay in office because Joe made political decisions they dislike *a really long time ago* probably isn't worth spending time convincing.
The self interest of the working people with actual needs they can't meet is a mile apart from wealthy people protecting their money and privilege and you know it.
[removed]
Bernie is consistent, even now as he goes hardest at Biden it's about his voting record and establishment position, not any of the nasty online shit.
Herbalife socialism.
I mean, I agree in theory, but it's got zero to do with political candidates, it's an issue with how voter registrations are handled at the state level. All it would do for Biden, or Pete, if they refused to use it would be put them at a massive and probably insurmountable disadvantage.   It'd be like running for office but refusing to attend any debate on a biased news channel because ~principles~. You'd miss literally every debate, everyone ELSE would still do it, and then you'd lose.  Now, they ARE obligated to opt you out on request. You can absolutely tell them not to contact you again and they will have to remove you from their list.
Jeez. Can’t imagine getting a call from Bernie. His shouting would fuck up the speakers in the phone real bad
Like NPR... I made that mistake. They followed me across country and continents...

He has been sending text messages saying that all week. If you are in the US, you got one.
Former Republican presidential candidate Joe Walsh endorses Joe Biden
I’d love to see more high profile republicans doing this. Obviously, we’re not going to sway the people who would support Trump even if he shot someone, but this is going to erode any centrist Republicans who are torn.
I really dislike Walsh, but everyone ought to oppose Trump.
As much as I like to see prominent Republicans in active opposition to their own President, I then remember that if Joe wins that they'll go back to hating his policies on January 20th at 12:01pm.  In no way should they be considered pro-Biden. They're just anti-Trump. And I even have a lot of respect with people like Bill Kristol and George Will.
Joes endorsing Joes
Hey Bernie Bros, this is what bridge-building looks like.
Nice, but one year ago he was knowingly spewing birther garbage.  This should be another thanks but no thanks from the Biden camp.
Neat.
We need all the Republican endorsements we can get. As many people as possible to validate those who think they want to vote against Trump.
He's kind of insane. Not sure if I want this endorsement.
Okay but I ain't sharpie-ing him onto the tshirt.
wearing his Walsh 2020 button
One endorsement we could do without, Walsh is not a good guy, he is on the right team by accident.
Joe's uniting the nation against Trump! 🤝💎🐊
Joe Walsh is an asshole and has supported a ton of horrible ideas/bills in Congress BUT he hates Trump with a passion so, welcome aboard asshole Joe Walsh!
I will take any vote at this point, but Joe Walsh is a piece of shit. I heard him on the radio 3 yrs ago defending the first amendment rights of hate speech. Never heard him arduously defend the 1st amendment unless it involved white nationalists. POS
This guy is a nobody
If anyone would like to know more on Joe Walsh here's his wikipedia page but I'm going to directly link to the weird statements he's made. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Walsh_(American_politician)#Controversial_statements  "Let's hope that when the Islamists next strike they first behead the appeasing cowards at CNN, MSNBC, etal who refused to show the cartoons."- Joe on the Charlie Hebdo shooting massacre.    https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom/status/555439146253426688
This endorsement shouldn't be celebrated.  It's there, cool, and maybe Walsh really has changed. But still wouldnt be wise to tout this one.
We need to start a movement....   Republicans for Biden, Make America America Again!
Mitt Romney endorsement, possibly?
I wouldn’t be surprised to see a Kasich endorsement.
Bill Weld!
I strongly think he will get John Kasich which could help with Ohio
I agree, but a vote is a vote
It’s fine for Biden voters to hate some of his policies, in my opinion. If this was a normal election cycle then I’d agree, but the political lines are changing and to win Joe needs as much support as possible. We have a big tent for a reason.
I’ll take anti-Trump at this point.
Enemy of my enemy is my friend.
It's a joe-endorse-joe world out there
High turnout requires big tents
Honestly, I think that makes it all the more important. If we don’t allow for former far-right-wingers into our coalition we're basically saying that we don’t believe that people can change their minds/be convinced. It’s basically resigning ourselves to eternal us vs them gridlock.   In fact, I think it’s these endorsements that matter the most.
Lmao “one of these seem not like the others”
[removed]
I agree, I don’t think the campaign should tout it. I just wanted to post it here because I thought people would be interested.
That could genuinely put Utah in play
He endorsed Hillary (along with the Bush's), despite not really liking Hillary all that much.  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he started damn-well campaigning for Biden. I can see those two really respecting each other on a personal level.
I feel like this is a possibility, but far from a guarantee. I’m holding out hope the guy has grown some integrity since 2012.
 Romney already saw through Trump in 2016 and predicted the damage that will be done but refused to support Hillary. That being said, things changed even more and fairly recently, impeachment and then the covid-19 crisis... Holy shit, Mitt Romney already has a "good and very honorable and courageous man who just happens to be conservative so we have to disagree on anything anyway" label in my book after his impeachment vote, if he did as much as an actual endorsement of Biden he would become a legend in reaching across the isle. This is so unlikely i do not even want to allow myself to consider that not to be disappointed, but now it is too late, i'm excited.
That would make my political year if that happened. I hope so.
Yes. This election is bigger than any single policy. Democracy itself is on the ballot. We need as many allies as possible so that we can demonstrate unequivocally that we as a nation reject Trumpism.
🌁🏗=♾⛺
lmao we could add him to the Go Joe United photoshop image but we'd spend the next four months like "who the fuck is that guy, I don't recognize him. Is that the republican? That might be the republican."
I take issue with people that ONLY defend the first amendment when it’s hate speech. Don’t tell me what my political ideology is.
Yeah I don't have a problem with it being posted here, just probably shouldn't be something people talk about for very long.
Utah can be in play. I truly believe Biden puts it in play, but I don't think any of the candidates (Trump included) fully realize it yet. I have a whole theory that I finally get to share.   Utah is the third most Republican state in the country, behind Wyoming and Oklahoma (yes, it’s ahead of West Virginia and Alabama) with an R+31 partisan lean, per [Morning Consult via 538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-states-where-trump-is-more-and-less-popular-than-he-should-be/) (sorry, couldn't find the Morning Consult page). Utah has gone red every presidential election since 1968, and Barack Obama lost the state to Romney [72.8 to 24.8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election_in_Utah) and McCain [62.6 to 34.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_Utah).  However, Trump became the first Republican candidate to receive less than 50 percent of the [Utah vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Utah) - capturing 45.5 percent to Hillary Clinton’s 27.5. Since Trump’s inauguration, his approval rating has dropped further than any other state that elected him in 2016 - including the Rust Belt that handed him the election. Trump’s net approval in Utah has dropped [30 points](https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump-2/) on average. For the first time since his election, a majority of [Utahns approve of Trump](https://kutv.com/news/local/for-the-first-time-a-majority-of-utah-voters-approve-of-president-donald-trump). But, polling in the state conducted over the summer said 53 percent of Utahn’s disapprove of Trump, with a whopping 44 percent saying they “strongly disapprove” compared to only 25 percent of registered Utahn’s “strongly approve” of him.  In 2018, Utah elected Mitt Romney (an outspoken critic of Trump) to Senate but more importantly, elected a DEMOCRAT to the House. Ben McAdams, of Utah’s 4th district, includes the most densely populated areas of the state - Salt Lake City, South Salt Lake, and West Valley. Now, McAdam’s had only won by less than 700 votes but still managed to unseat black Republican Mia Love, despite Love distancing herself from Trump. McAdams is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate and conservative Dems. He’s pro-life but came out openly in favor of impeachment over the Ukraine scandal. Which brings me to ...  Impeachment! In a poll published on December 16, [Utah Policy](https://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/22457-utahns-remain-deeply-divided-on-impeachment) concluded that state voters are divided on impeachment. 47 percent did not approve of impeachment and believed Trump should complete his term. But! 19 percent believe Congress should investigate for more information and 34 percent believe there is enough evidence to begin impeachment proceedings, representing 53 percent of Utah voters who are (at very least) in favor of the House’s impeachment *inquiry*.  Next, in the weeks after his legacy-building vote to convict a sitting president of his own party, Senator Romney was welcomed back to Utah with somewhat open arms. 49 percent of voters approved of his vote, while *only* 60 percent of GOP voters disapproved, per the [Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics ](https://www.deseret.com/utah/2020/2/11/21133232/mitt-romney-donald-trump-mitt-impeachment-split-deseret-news-hinckley-poll-convict-divided).  Which, ok, that’s a lot of good information right? Maybe Utah is annoyed with Trump but that doesn’t mean they’ll suddenly go for Biden. They’ll just swallow their morality and back Trump. Right?  I don’t think so. All the above has been enough to convince me that Utah is flirting with a swing, but what really convinced was when I stumbled on to the below graphic per Wikipedia. And this is so important. If you compare the partisan swing of each state from 2012 to 2016’s presidential election, it’s not Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Texas, or North Carolina that swung the furthest. And it’s not a blue or toss-up state that swung the reddest. [See for yourself](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Presidential_Election_Results_Swing_by_State_from_2012_to_2016.svg). It was Utah. By a fucking SWING.  Total speculation, but during the 2012 VP debate, Biden spoke about being personally against abortion and guided by his Catholic faith. But also explained that the conviction he adopts in his personal life is not necessarily a platform he would pursue as VP (or President). Trump is so clearly the antithesis of good faith, honest Christianity, and wellness that I think that’s why Utah - the Mormon and “good faith community” capital of the country - has never fully backed his political career.  It also helps that Biden and John McCain were so close, given McCain was from Arizona and the state has both a fond view of Biden **and** maybe a purple state this year.   Of course, in all likelihood, Utah would probably go to Trump in the fall. But, barring any political earthquakes, if there is one Democratic candidate who can give Trump a serious run for his money in the (third) reddest of red states, it's Diamond Joe.
Would help a little with AZ to.  There’s a significant LDS population there.
Mitt doesn’t have that kind of backbone.  And if he does, I will gladly rescind my words.  EDIT: Everyone who is all like “Romney is an okay guy” completely gloss over the horrendous votes he has taken and repeatedly refuses to admonish this administration for a person constantly lauded for his integrity.  And I haven’t forgotten that he tried to lie and say that Obama didn’t call what happened in Benghazi an act of terror or that he bullied a gay kid when he was younger or whatever terrible shit that he’s done.  I’m glad to see y’all are willing to forget that shit, though. Do better.
Utah could be in play if there is a conservative third-party spoiler like McMullen and the stars align. It is most likely going to Trump, though.
No it wouldn’t. Come on
I don't think Romney actually endorsed Hillary, he just did an anti-Trump speech.  As for the Bushs, they have been mostly quiet, though H.W. Bush said he voted for Trump, I think the other Bushs voted for Johnson or something.
And the fact of the matter is Joe doesn’t even need to really win the state in the end, he just needs to keep Trump focusing his resources there instead of Arizona, Ohio and the rust belt.  Trumps resources are joes biggest obstacle to beating him. But if Joe can get endorsements and surrogates from Romney, and maybe even McMullin and Huntsman, then the threat of Utah going blue can force Trump’s team to turn attention to it. If Joe can pull the Latino vote into his coalition then that threat will be even greater.   Arizona I think is truly going to be in play. The popularity of Mark Kelly will only help that. If the Mormon population of Arizona can be convinced to listen to endorsements from prominent Mormon political leaders, then that only becomes more true and may help the senate election.  On a similar note. An endorsement from Kasich can help win Ohio.
He did vote to impeach trump, and now supports a UBI stimulus
I understand feeling this way based on some things he's done in the past... but Romney is the only senator in US history for vote for the removal of a president of their own party. He isn't totally spineless.
[deleted]
I think he will. He’s old and clearly thinks Trump is a danger to our country, as referenced in his vote to convict. He and Joe have worked together for decades as well.
I will eat all of my words that I've said about Romney over the years if it happens, honestly, he's the only satyr who I think could pull off because I'm pretty sure he will get reelected in perpetuity until the day he dies in Utah
Romney isn’t a “lack of backbone” guy. He’s a good and true politician, and I have a ton of respect for him, despite not really agreeing with him policy wise.
I can provide a shovel to make it easier to eat them.
What an absurd thing to say, especially in light of recent votes.
Utahns really do not like Trump but are quite fond of Mitt- Evan McMullin & HRC combined for 4 points more of the vote than Trump in 2016. Like, Trump's the favorite in Utah regardless of what happens but a Mitt endorsement makes a Biden win there possible imo, as the Mormons would likely have a decent amount of their vote go toward Biden
Precisely. Have Trump defend Montana, Kansas, Utah, and Georgia.
But he also voted to confirm Supreme Court justices appointed by Trump and a whole gaggle of other shit.
That was a one time 1000 dollar stimulus, not UBI.
I like Mitt Romney. He’s an old guard Republican, one with whom Joe Biden will have no problem working.
We can't be purity testing Republicans here 😂
He’s a conservative; he’ll vote to confirm conservative judges. At this point, Mitt will never reconcile with the Trump side of the GOP, all because of his impeachment vote.  Romney also said he wouldn’t vote for Trump for president, and that he wouldn’t vote for Bernie or Warren (I know she dropped out) either. Romney will probably endorse Biden.
character growth is a thing that exists even for republicans. sometimes. when the stars align.
Yeah that's a pretty significant difference. But still surprising.
Agreed. I'm from mass and I went to college tuition free thanks to him.
Actually, he’s kind of left even compared to most old guard republicans. He swung to the right more when he was campaigning to get his party’s nod for president.
Absolutely, it was good to hear it!
Nice. I get a very decent vibe from that man.
I went to college with a family friend of his and she said he's a legitimately good man.

One thing you have to give Joe credit for is he's demonstrated a lifelong capacity to grow and evolve. The Joe today isn't necessarily the same Joe 40 years ago...and that's a good thing.
Word! Biden was a great wingman for Obama and he is going to be a great President. Our allies all over the world will be delighted to see a familiar face, a person they can trust. A man of his word. A Biden.
👏👏👏👏👏
Bravo.
 "We know Joe"
Joe's got Baracks back.
I'm curious to hear from some Biden supporters on the topic of weed legalization. Seeing as it has historically been used as a war on the black community, how do black supporters of Biden feel about his stance on marijuana?
Damn Joe is cool, who is the black man though? She doesn't say.
[removed]
So the things joe has done dont matter bc he had the "humility" to accept the lowly position of VP to a black man?   What measurable things has joe done to improve the lives of minorities? Is the goal for our politicians to simply not be segregationists anymore?
He was picked in 2008 to help with the moderate vote. Nothing more, nothing less. This post lacks fact.

That’s the result of a good politician who understands change and isn’t afraid to admit when he was wrong, as long as he’s shown ability to actually adapt with that change
Biden wants to decriminalize weed, exspounge the records of those with weed related crimes, and not get in the way of states who decide to legalize.   His stance takes away alot of the criminal justice issues around weed.   (To clarify I am not black and am not trying to answer your question, I am just adding context of his stance).
I’m not a POC but I’m a Biden supporter whose top issue is criminal justice reform. People misunderstand and overestimate the role and the reach of the federal government. First, it’s crucial to understand that the majority of incarcerated individuals are imprisoned by the *state*—and not the federal—government. Likewise, the majority of drug convictions in this country occur at the *state* level. While legalizing marijuana at the federal level is fine, it will still be illegal in the vast majority of the states. The president does not have the power to make marijuana legal in Kentucky, for example. So people in Kentucky and other states will continue to be prosecuted for marijuana possession.   Given those facts, I don’t see any measurable advantage of legalization vs decriminalization (which Biden supports) at the federal level. Legalization is red meat for the left, sure. But it also expends political capital and unnecessarily, given that decriminalization is also an option.  ETA - word
It's Barack Obama.
That's a good question. Biden was instrumental is getting Obama to support gay marriage. Biden was one of the first to come out in support of gay marriage. Biden got millions of people health care when he helped get the ACA passed. My health insurance now covers things it did not before, like mental health, and I can't be refused insurance because of pre-existing conditions.  Meanwhile, Bernie has opened 3 post offices in his 30 years in congress because he can't work well with others and does not believe in compromise. Bernie had 10 years to reach out to black voters and instead he called them establishment democrats. He insulted the Democratic party for 10 years and it seems black people like the Democratic party. Bernie insulted Obama and now uses him as a prop in a commercial.
And that takes absolutely nothing away from the point of this post.
>Not being a racist is not an accomplishment.   In a country full of racists, yes it is.
Are you black? Are you really arguing with a black man one what he thinks is beneficial to his race?
You clearly haven't heard of the GOP. They're this group of congressmen and women who refused to work with Obama, even on issues where they agreed with him. They just wanted to deny him any political victories.
This is what is important. The ability to say "I was wrong" is necessary for us to grow as human beings.
I'm progressive, and while I eventually want legalization, I'm okay with the states being the ones to do it. It will come in time and be all the harder to take away once it does.   But this approach is a great stop gap in the meantime that the vast majority of people can get on board with
Actually Federal Law is the law of the land. If Congress passes a law legalizing weed nationwide then states cannot overrule this and criminalize weed. Of course if they only go as far as to decriminalize it, that wouldn’t give enough teeth to any legislation to force states to comply.
Thank you.  If there's one thing we don't need on this sub, it's needless vaguebooking.

It’s the most important characteristic of an academic
That’s just not true. States have the ability to pass more stringent laws that go beyond the federal restrictions. If you were talking about a constitutional right, you’d be correct. But you’re not. [Proposed legislation has recognized this limitation. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/11/20/house-committee-approves-bill-decriminalizing-marijuana-on-the-federal-level.html).  Same goes for pardoning/expunging state marijuana convictions: the federal government has *no* power to do so. The president can only pardon *federal* marijuana convictions, which again, comprises a small minority of marijuana convictions.
Did you not know any black people in positions of authority growing up? A teacher, a pastor, a boss?   White people lose their damn minds every single day they have to defer to a black person in authority. It takes conscious effort for white people to unlearn and fight back against the racism at all levels of society.
Joe isn’t asking for special treatment, the person was just saying they trust that he respects black people because they witnessed his respect for the Obamas. Do you remember Obama’s first state of the union? Congress members were going crazy, yelling out “liar”, blocking every piece of legislation they could for no reason. They wanted him to have no accomplishments in office because they were angry a black man got there. It’s extremely upsetting.
I think getting tenure is the most important part of an academic.
if Congress passes a law legalizing weed with language protecting the right of its usage, states would have to go to court to have the law voided or that specific part of the law. they can’t simply ignore Federal Law or countermand it. States can offer protections in excess of what Federal Law does (see also state FMLA protections that exceed Federal protections) but they cannot pass laws that will pass muster before the courts that countermand Federal Law.
[deleted]
The op is saying what joe Biden has done in the past doesn’t matter. I disagree. I see joe possibly being opportunistic. Making terrible decisions that negatively effect those who can’t do anything for him.  Obama has something to offer and turned bidens whole career around. We should all be thanking Obama, not Biden. Biden got a free ride off of Obama’s success. Biden is indebted to Obama, not the other way around.
touché
If you look at the link above, you’ll see that congress can even pass a law legalizing it and leaving it to the states, so what you’re saying is a nonstarter. Moreover, if you go back to the original question, it seemed to be comparing Biden’s stance to Bernie’s. Bernie’s stance is *not* to have congress pass this kind of legislation—even he probably recognizes that’s a nonstarter—but to decree it by presidential order, which would not have the power you’re suggesting.
>My point is treating people like individuals should be expected.  And my point is that it's not actually expected. Racism isn't "alive and well" it's the base condition of our country. It takes hard, conscious effort to work against.  >It is entitled to think your special for treating people with decency.  Most people *don't* treat each other with decency, and doubly so for how most white people treat most black people. I'm not sure you realize how abnormal it is in this country for a white man to treat a black man with respect and defer his own judgement and will to the black man's.   That a white man consciously chose to be an ally for eight years made an impression with black voters like Laurie. Biden demonstrated exactly how an ally should act. Nobody is praising him for doing the minimum, because he stepped up instead of just doing the minimum.
Sure, Obama helped Biden’s career, what does that have to do with why many black folks like Joe?
Opportunistic? Out of curiosity, who do you support?

That’s what the post is talking about.
NBC News has projected that Joe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Texas!

We're going to Whataburger right now.  🤣
Well, we ridin' with Biden now. All the way to the White House!
**CNN** has finally projected that Joe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Texas.
We can’t keep winning
See Texas was the main state I was fretting over in all this. A lot of the others the polling and betting odds on them swung so far one way or the other there was never any drama in it.  But Texas could have gone either way so I was watching it like a hawk until 2am my time when I had to go annoyingly go to sleep.
The results today make me really glad on your behalf, Americans. And on the behalf of the world, really.
I voted early for Pete in a Super Tuesday state, so I've been a little detached watching results. This is just insane, I can't believe how much Biden is killing it.   And the upcoming states are really favorable to him too.   What a comeback. Congrats Joe

$400 in Bernie No shares on PredictIt.  I have no idea why people thought Bernie was going to win that state.  I'm from Texas, haven't lived there in almost 10 years, and even I knew despite Sanders's reported lead in the polls that he didn't have a chance there.
Omg thank you Beto!
Bloomberg is out, as per MSNBC. Hopefully all of his money goes to Biden.
#🥁🥁🥁
Woot super excited he won. I'm California but thank you Texas.
Everybody and their mother ran for president this year, but in the end, it was Uncle Joe all along
Yess!!!
Oh yeah. It’s all coming together.
Comeback kid
Disappointed but congratulations to Joe and you guys who support him. He did incredible today
I’m beyond happy with the results from yesterday, but Bernie is still too close for comfort for me.
Best week ever, now that Mike's out, nothing shall stop us!!!
I did it! 🐊
Yes!!!!!!!
God bless!
Team Joe!
Yeah! *💎💎💎💎💎💎*
Holy shit balls! That's awesome.
Now he just needs to make it through the March 15th debate.
Trump supporter here. Glad your guy won TX. If I have to choose between Bernie and Biden, hope to God its not Bernie that becomes president.
Beto comes through

Do not censor my opinion. I voted in Texas as a Democrat and my words should be just as important as yours. I want the best for this country and I believe Bernie is the only candidate that can shift us in the right direction. I am simply expressing my views.

I was telling HonoredPeople in another thread, this subreddit has been a wonderful community over the last months. Small, but with a lot of heart and positivity. I post here constantly, and the events of the last few days feel like a dream come true.
I like to feel like I played my part by opening the live chat during that last debate.  It literally felt like the moment of turnaround for me aside of course the confirmation of that being SC.
49% of decisions made the last few days must be unprecedented. There can be no doubt that Pete's and Amy's supporters won this.
Floridian here. I am doing my part to make sure Bernie is finished for good come the 17th. Can't wait.
I campaigned for Joe here in Mass, we pulled out a completely unexpected win. Going to vote absentee for him in Michigan now.
Floridian here , already voted early for Biden  My wife was Team Pete but was waiting to see what happened and is now with Diamond Joe for a same day vote.   💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
Missourian here! I’ve been behind Joe since day one of him announcing this campaign. Can’t wait to vote for him. This is my first election I am able to vote in as well!
Ohio here! Canvassing and phone banking for Joe.  I don’t early vote because I like to see live turn out.
I think Michigan is going to be a hard win but I'll be doing my part.
Really makes you think
The TexInception.
This, but unironically.
I started this election as a volunteer for Beto. As much as I love that man and his campaign, it feels so much better to be united!
I was stoked I even got my GF to vote for him today even though we lost big here in commie-fornia.
Can we get a Feel the Clyburn flair? Maybe with some 🔥 🔥
Trump was finally right.  I think I’m tired of winning.  Not too tired to knock out the rest of these mo’effin primaries and the general though!!
Hi quick question how common is it for people from other countries to discuss American politics? When I studied abroad it was all the news would talk about but do people actually care??
You joke but there's an article exactly like this about a former bandmate of Beto's right now.
Joe Mama
Tbf I think he would’ve taken it fairly easily had Amy Pete and Beto not all just endorsed him lol
Endorsement is inbound [per Hunter Walker of Yahoo! News](https://twitter.com/hunterw/status/1235221938886397953/photo/1)!
Wow, everything is coming up Biden.
[removed]
Thank you for your kind words. The only thing matters going forward is defeating Donald Trump.
It's far from over. Those early votes are costly.   But on the upside Pete and Amy delivered.
I've got some Trump voters in my family who have told me they're jaded by Trump in the last couple of years, but they're scared of leftist Democrats. So, they told me that if Biden is the nominee, they'll support him over Trump, but if it was Warren or Sanders, they'd stick with Trump.   Do you know anyone like that in your circles?  Seems to me like Biden is the only one who can really get meaningful conservative support.
Same here, Bernie is too radical for my taste. I’d take Biden tho :/
I’m glad you were able to vote! And your opinion is valid :)
All are welcome here so long as you are civil and not talking conspiracy  Bernie has pushed the party left for that I'm thankful.  Here's hoping he doesn't repeat 16 if it becomes clear he can't win the nomination, the goal is to come together to defeat the worst president in our history. If Trump wins the courts are fucked for 25 years and God knows what else could happen
 Valid opinion
Need to bring party together to beat Trump. Let's focus on decency and inclusion as Joe talks about.
I don’t think that’s the right attitude to have. Biden has been running a campaign of inclusion, and laughing at people when their candidate underperforms is not inclusive. That’s not the type of behavior that will win us the general election.
Yo don’t do this.   Seriously. We’re all in this together. Their loss is not our gain unless you want to feel 10x worse in November when we all lose.
Removed: Please follow the Rules of the Road. Its fine to celebrate, but gloating isnt how we're going to build a coalition to beat Trump
There appears to be some genuine self-reflection which is refreshing to see. Unfortunately for them, it’s coming far too late.
Rules of the road!

Ok, interesting take I don’t agree with, but how have his recent policies and work with progressives not shown how his views have changed? Also, not a great moral high horse to mount as you wish for “trump to bully an old man”.
“I guarantee based on no evidence I have presented”
You did! Every person aboard matters. That's what makes this a coalition: you.
It also makes you wonder how much early voting actually hurt Biden. Pete got some pretty big chunks in some of these states that would have gone to Biden  Biden could have actually done even better than this, amazing
Let's keep that Joementum going!
Jim Clyburn saved the Democratic Party, and thus the entire country.
Let's hand it to the king maker. Clyburn is the embodiment of a 'giant' in the field of politics and activism.

That guy looks good for 79!
Obama and Harry Reid also doing some impressive behind the scenes work!
I have never heard him speak but something tells me it’s like silky honey to the ears...

Legitimately crazy to feel the subtle hand of Obama shift things over one weekend.
Beto delivering Texas?
Pete delivering delivering a majority of his supporters and volunteers.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer Endorsed Joe Biden Ahead Of Her State's Big Primary
This is big.
Winning Michigan just got a whole heck of a lot easier.
This is a big fucking deal! If 💎 Joe wins Michigan, it will effectively end Bernie’s campaign. I hope my home state makes the right decision!
No, this is not the establishment deciding or whatever it is called by the losing side. Joe endorsed her when she was running for Governor race.   On the contrary Sanders campaigned for her challenger, Abdul El-Sayed, who falsely accused her of campaign finance fraud. Guess what? He was caught committing an actual campaign finance fraud.   It's not the establishment, it's the goodwill that Joe has developed over all these years that is helping him now.
This and Granholm's endorsement yesterday are excellent news.
💎🐊💎 JOEMENTUM 💎🐊💎
Nice
She's always been a favorite of mine to be his VP
And whack job, super mature Rashida “Boo Hillary” Tlaib just slandered him. I know Michigan is much smarter than that.
two Michigan newspapers and Michigan governor endorsed Biden.  Now my question to berniebros, which candidate has better chance to win Michigan?
Question for people in MI: would Biden's vote on Nafta hurt him here or is there still a pool of goodwill for him for saving the auto industry in the first years of the Obama administration?
First it was Jennifer Granholm, now Gretchen Whitmer.   Go get them Governors, Joe!
On the same day as Val Demings AND Tammy Duckworth!
It's gonna be a good night!
Keep on keeping on Joe.
Anyone else like her for VP?
Thank you, Gretchen.
Biden VP pick?
Joe Biden did so much for Michigan and the auto industry during the recession. He was there every few months lending help for teachers, auto suppliers, construction workers etc.
She said focus on “dinner table” issues... like Bernie isn’t.  She’s an idiot.
If Biden wins Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, and maybe even Idaho next Tuesday, I think it's over for Sanders
Is she well liked there?
Missouri and Mississippi seem to be solid for Biden too. What do you make of Idaho? Seems like it and Washington are the only states Sanders will take next Tuesday
Just voted absentee for him 🤞
How big of an influence does Whitmer have there? Is she popular?    (EDIT: I just saw this got asked below already)
Establishment is just the boogieman word for the Democratic Party.  As a former Sanders supporter I see now that when everyone was talking about how evil the establishment was it was really just them excusing Bernie for not making political allies.  Seeing people react to Klobuchar and Buttigieg dropping out and endorsing Biden (calling it a DNC conspiracy) really opened my eyes to how many of the other Sanders supporters seem naive about political reality.
When folks say The Establishment I think:  The Congressional Black Caucus  Defending the Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act  Defending a Woman's Right to Choose  Protecting Marriage Equality  Protecting the Environment   Advancing the Franchise  When I hear people rail against "The Establishment", I see them attacking these very things.

And the previous governor also endorsed Biden.
The messaging that really worked for Obama was the auto bailout.  Hammer that message home.
Needs to message on the auto bailout and being there for Michigan at that time.  NAFTA hurts, though each year it becomes a bit less of a thing.
Surprised more people aren't talking about her. I think she is perfect.  She has loads of experience. Will pretty much guarantee the 'Mum' vote. And can definitely help win back the key battleground states e.g. Michigan, Ohio etc.
I think at this point with all of the momentum, he might sweep every state on Tuesday.
I'd be shocked if Bernie doesn't take Idaho.  The Conservatism here is so dominant and noxious that it pushes the liberals farther and farther to the left.  Since 2016 when Bernie won here with 78%, the condition has only worsened as boomers who didn't want to pay their taxes in California, Washington, and Oregon have immigrated.  There's a godamn bill on the table right now to eliminate property taxes and double sales taxes.
Even if it's all but over for him, you know he'll drag it out just like he did in 2016.
Bernie has taken much of the latino vote, which is strong for Hillary, but Biden has taken much of the white working class vote away from Bernie.  This helped Biden win Oklahoma and Maine from Bernie.  There aren't many latino heavy states left in the primary, just New Mexico and Arizona.  This means that Biden take states like Idaho and North Dakota on Tuesday which Bernie won last time.  The big prize is obviously Michigan due to it having most of the delegates on Tuesday.
And to think I was hopeless just a week ago. This is amazing!
What worries me, though, is if Biden wins, will all the people who were going to vote for Sanders then switch their vote to Biden?
Biden will have won every state starting with Mi-!
You didn't even mention Florida. One of the most delegate-rich states  left on the calendar where it is literally plausible that Bernie won't even be viable and Biden will take every single delegate. That is how atrocious the state's demographics are for Bernie.
I just looked it up, and according to a poll in January, her approval rating is low (around 43%) but her disapproval rating is lower (around 35%), so she's not well-liked, but she isn't super-disliked. Her approval rating is higher with older voters, and since Joe has shown he's done better at turning out older voters, I think that's a good sign.  [source](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/politics/2020/01/09/poll-michigan-gov-whitmers-approval-rating-takes-slight-drop/)
Well enough. People respect her, her whole campaign was based on “Fixing the damn roads” and there’s been a lot of construction lately.  It’ll help.
Eh. Nobody really loves her.
I am hopeful for Idaho. Pete was big here. Sold out our Idaho Dems gala because he was slated to speak. It was and still is Bernie country, but the margins could be narower.
Yeah Missouri should be good. Sanders has lost much of his support from WWC voters and he hasn't made inroads with black voters. That's the ballgame in Missouri.
Idaho only has 25 delegates.  Not much of a prize compared to the others.
Idaho and North Dakota should swing for Biden because he has gained, over Hillary, a large chunk of the white working class vote from Bernie.  Washington seems completely out of the question for us, but hopefully we can squeeze his lead there.
>Seeing people react to Klobuchar and Buttigieg dropping out and endorsing Biden (calling it a DNC conspiracy) really opened my eyes to how many of the other Sanders supporters seem naive about political reality.  Oh God I have a friend who cannot let this go... Like it's so unbelievable that a candidate who repeatedly publicly criticized Sanders would see the benefit in throwing support behind his strongest competitor without the DNC somehow twisting his arm 🙄 I think your description of the mindset and its motivation is spot on.
Establishment is akin to the "deep state" on the other side.
Yeah, I didn't hear any of them crying "conspiracy" when AOC endorsed Bernie. Plus Sanders has been in DC for 30 years, if he had been a registered Democrat from the start he would have had major influence in shaping the party establishment, instead he chose to sit on the sidelines. I just hope now that it's down to two candidates everyone in the party cools down and gets behind whoever has the most votes (presumably Joe) instead of helping Trump get reelected by focusing our anger on each other.
THANK YOU! In 2016, Hillary was rewarded with a lot of endorsements because she had been there. She mentored so many candidates, showed up to events, helped them hook up with the right consultants. Obama created his own amazing team, but Hillary had been in this world for years. There is an entire generation of politicians and campaign staff who got their start with Clinton, or by a Clinton mentee. Joe is the same way. He has been there for a very long time.
Whoaaa I didnt know this. I voted for Abdul in 2018 before I jumped off the Bernie train. Big yikes
The former governor that endorsed him made a point of the bailout and the economic stimulus saving Michigan.
Also keep in mind in Clinton was never popular here, in 2008 she was the only major candidate even on the ballot (there was a fiasco caused by us moving our primary to an early date) and barely got half the vote in a race vs "undecided".  So Clinton's 2016 experience of losing vs Sanders is unlikely to be repeated by Joe Biden IMHO.  He's viewed as far more of a friend of rust belt blue collar workers then Clinton ever was.
Washington might not be doable, but if the rural moderate counties turn out for him harder than the progressive youth in Seattle, then just maybe we can flip it
Idaho was a caucus state in 2016. Joe might have a decent shot at winning there now that they switched to primaries.
Boomers migrating is good for Biden no?  Anyway I agree, Utah is a good bellweather for ID, MT and Wyoming
Note: he's taken much of the *young* Latino vote, which skews hard to the left.  In Florida and Arizona where the Latino and Hispanic population is much more moderate and conservative Biden excels
Polls suggest that~85% will
I was only listing March 10th states. The 17th has FL, GA, IL, OH, and AZ, which might literally end this nomination process in a single day lol...
Michigander here. People are mostly upset because she hasn’t been able to follow through on campaign promises - but that’s almost entirely because the state legislature is held by Republicans and we’re still using gerrymandered maps. She’s wanted to get road funding, to reform auto insurance, to stop the pension tax - it’s Republicans that are stopping her because... well, they’re Republicans.
Her approval rating among the general public really isn't relevant here. Her [net approval among Democrats](https://morningconsult.com/governor-rankings/) is +51
What is approval among *democrats*?
Idaho was a caucus in 2016 though which skewed it hard for Sanders.  ND is now the only caucus state next Tuesday
Yeah but it bodes well for morale to only lose a single state.
ND is a caucus however, likely to Sanders' advantage
Even if the DNC (read: other Democrats Buttigieg wants a good relationship with) did put pressure on him, that's not an evil conspiracy. Getting pressure to work with your party is a trade off for getting relief from your party's help on other things. It's not like Buttigieg (or most of the candidates) got where he is alone and working with the party rather than against it means he has more support for his future political career.  "Back room deals" and "conspiracy arrangements" basically just seem to amount to a normal give and take within a political party. It's not like they took his family hostage unless he dropped out of the race.
The latest Washington polls were all done before South Carolina.  I don’t think we can look at even Bernie’s prior lead as evidence of anything.   Now that the Biden coalition has coalesced, I don’t think Sanders could win even if Warren threw her supporters to him.   The polls show the Democratic electorate isn’t voting on ideology or specific policy positions or 2016 camps as much as “Who can beat Donald Trump?”  That overrides everything.  I suspect Bernie will likely even lose some support from prior polling just because the “Bernie surging...Bernie will turn out the youth...Bernie is dominating among Latinos...” narratives have all fallen flat.   This is unprecedented in American politics.  And of course Joe’s personality is part of that, but this swing is more due to one party’s deep-seated hatred of the incumbent President.  That army wants a war.  And they want to mobilize quickly.  They don’t want to bother with a contentious primary.  I think Tuesday is going to be another rout.
I actually think Bernie is pretty vulnerable here. He took it as a caucus state 4 years ago, but Washington also held a non-binding primary vote after that, which Clinton won. The polling data available is from 3 weeks ago, and only had Bernie up by 6 over Bloomberg. The Biden/Bloomberg/Buttigieg/Klobuchar combined number in that poll is 45, versus Bernie/Warren at 32.
That would be wild
I dunno about that when it comes to Washington. Yeah it doesn't have a significant black population, but it does have lots of college educated, suburban, and WWC voters which Joe did well with on Tuesday. Hillary actually won the non-binding primary there in 2016, which was held months after the caucus.
People forget that Hillary WON the WA primary in 2016, the issue is that WA Dems used an earlier caucus that Sanders won to allocate our delegates.  WA Dems got rid of the caucus and the legislature moved the primary date up to March 10. So I think Biden has a pretty good chance of winning the primary here.
Isn't Washington mail-in voting?  Could it be like Colorado and Utah where a lot of the vote happened before the South Carolina surge?
I'm glad I waited to turn in my ballot. Going to have to cross off Pete's name, but glad to do it.
A better shot anyways.  I could see a 59/41 Bernie outcome.
>Boomers migrating is good for Biden no?  The Boomers coming here are 100% Trumpsters.
Yes, but even in California, Biden beat Bernie by just 6% among old Latino voters.  Many Latinos really empathise with Bernie being the children of immigrants and his experiences which Biden doesn't have.
What is her stance on letting MN annex Isle Royal?
Hoosier here. I love her, and hope you can flip the legislature. We spend a lot of time in Michigan because she has good plans.
unrelated question  but why is it Michigander and not Michigan?
Oh, good point.
/u/BernankesBeard [said](https://old.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/comments/fdv9jy/michigan_governor_gretchen_whitmer_endorsed_joe/fjkcjtn/) it is +51
I keep forgetting that crucial switch. :)
The only polling data I found for Idaho had Sanders up by 6 but that was before all the dropouts and endorsements.    https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/state/  Looking good.  :-)
The whole concept of “give-and-take” and “behind-the-scrnes discussions” probably does sound nefarious when your whole candidate’s campaign is predicated on a liberal purity test.
It's called horse trading. It's a thing that happens in democracy. Folks who don't like democracy or democratic values tend to call such normal and healthy things conspiracies and such.
Yeah, but voting also started two weeks ago and most of us mail in our ballots. I wouldn't count on Washington going strong to Biden.
Hmm, interesting. Didn't know that, thanks!
Like a New Yorker...
Half the population of Michigan is male geese
It’s actually an ongoing debate!!!    https://www.michiganradio.org/post/michigander-or-michiganian-passionate-debate-over-what-call-people-mitten  I’m of the personal opinion that Michigander means ‘born and raised in Michigan’ like me. Michiganian is someone who moved here recently.  Then of course, the people in the Upper Penninsula are Yoopers and they call us trolls (because we live ‘under the (Mackinac) Bridge’)
Yeah that makes way more sense
You're not wrong, I just don't expect it to be firm for the Bern.
And because Michigananian would sound terrible.
Can confirm, am in Michigan.
Lol r/politicalHumor right now
My friend group is all pro-bernie and today they were talking about how the primaries were rigged by "the establishment".   Is it really hard to believe that there are more moderate democrats out there, or individuals who just prefer a different candidate over Sanders? Similarly, Reddit is its own echo-chamber.
I unsubbed 6 months ago.  That shit was getting unbearable.
I shouldn't laugh...  ....but I'm gonna.
JOE will have the Last Laugh...
This is why Bernie supporters as a group are a joke to me.  You complain about the establishment online but can't be bothered to vote?  Get out of here with that shit.
Wow, something actually good on that sub.
That sub is nowhere near as bad as r/presidentialracememes
How many down votes  and butt hurt comments did this get lol

The "establishment" are old black ladies.
I think the internet in general is an echo chamber. People need to be carful with this stuff. I had a few Yang gang friends that felt whip lash on voting days. All that matters is who comes out to vote.
It's absolutely terrible. Their mods remove anything that's remotely not-pro-Bernie under the facade of being "unfunny"/"low-effort"/"flamebait" too.
Good question
Also think that a lot of supporters are 14 and can’t vote...
WTAF? SMH…
It’s mind boggling frustrating
I haven't had that but I didn't post much.   I recall getting downvoted as anything in comments
Or Russian and can't vote.
I swear a notable portion of /r/sandersforpresident is teenagers in other countries asking how they can help Bernie
Absolutely beautiful speech tonight from Pete and Joe. The country will be a more compassionate place under their leadership

For those who might not be as familiar with Pete, he lost his dad last year. He got emotional speaking about his dad last night and I imagine hearing from Joe that Pete reminds him of Beau and how proud he is of Pete meant a great deal.
He didn't even need to say that! He already had Pete's endorsement! I'm crying so damn much!!!!!
As a Pete->Biden transplant, it meant so much to me. Biden is exactly what we need right now. He's the anti-Trump: sincere, honest, thoughtful, and caring. His speech was not the typical "blah blah I thank him for his endorsement" that we've seen in the past in these sorts of situations from other politicians, but a sincere appreciation of gratitude from Biden for helping him in such an important time.
The speech literally left me in tears, so genuine and heartfelt.  That’s why we need Joe as our next president. I appreciate the kindness and compassion that is Joe Biden.  Pete is and will have a phenomenal political career!
Seeing Chasten the other night choked up, then Pete choked up when talking about his dad, and now seeing Pete's reaction when Joe compared him to Beau, honestly this Pete supporter turned Joe supporter is a bit choked up now.
Genuinely touching.  Feels good to be in a coalition again.
Second time he's made me cry in a week guys. This man is magic  (First time was CNN town hall before SC)
Cried... never ashamed to admit
Ugh. It takes a lot to conjure up tears in my eyes. But, whew... man, that did it. Some really bright, beautiful souls just laid themselves bare to the world. Yeah. Reminds me why I supported Pete. Reminds me why I'm supporting Joe. Genuine, lovely people.
Okay. I'm all in.
Nice to see the parts that make Joe >>>>> Trump shining through so much more.
Joe is the man !
I just watched it and here I am, sitting on my couch crying. I can’t wait for his presidency and kindness being brought back into the White House.
Pete, who lost his father, and Joe, who lost his son. I teared up watching Joe come up behind Pete and put his hands on his shoulders in a very fatherly way.
I’m not crying. You’re crying.😭😭
Heres the video:   [https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/beau-biden-pete-buttigieg/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/beau-biden-pete-buttigieg/index.html)  &#x200B;  I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING!!
Watching Joe talk about Pete was just all the feels. I don’t know how they both made it through that without crying.
Does anybody have a link to the speech? I missed it
Probably the media will rip on Biden for this.... they will say they made a deal and put on a show. But I’m sold, that is real emotion.
I’m not crying. You’re crying.
Ever since Pete dropped out I've felt lost. I haven't been able to bring myself to take a good look at the other candidates yet, and I was very skeptical of Biden at the start of the race. After watching this I think I understand Joe a bit better and am more willing than I was before to give him a chance.   Above all I want to see our broken and hurt Nation find a way to begin to heal itself. I saw no other way than through Pete's leadership before. I thjnk I can start to see that in Joe now.
Am I dreaming or is it actually happening?  Uncle Joe is taking Pete under his wing!
oh GOD I hadn't connected it to Pete's dad until you said that, I \*was\* thinking Pete looked a little more choked up tonight than I would have expected.
Didn’t think you could beat Obama/Biden, but this is officially the most moving political relationship I have witnessed 😭😭
It looked like my man Pete was choking up behind Biden when he was saying it. Whew. That’s was emotional.
His dad's name : Joseph Buttigieg.
Time to cry is when he gets his VP position.  Be focused. Stay strong. Stay Pete.
I still haven't recovered from Pete getting choked up after \*IOWA\*, I'm not equipped to deal with THIS
Same! OMG...tears in two days. I can't take it anymore!!!
https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=562116484393448&id=7860876103&_rdr  Here ya go!
I don't know Biden well yet, if the MSM honestly believes that, they still don't know a damn thing about Pete.
I might actually be surprised if they rip on him for it. Biden's been around a long time, and the media know he wears his heart on his sleeve.
Pete definitely seemed to have tears in his eyes while Joe spoke. I never expected to see such a beautiful, honest moment that connected two people in a way they needed out of the ugliness of our current political landscape. Very glad they got to have that.
Yeah, his father (named Joseph, just saying) died right before Pete announced his run.
Imagine the three of them together. Look all I am saying is we have a shot at the most magical Democratic Party: Past, Present, Future type moment with the three of them. *I’ll die. I’ll simply die*
I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't know Biden was going to say it, based on his reaction.
Tell me his middle name was Robinette
My husband’s not hopeful that Pete will get VP, but I am. Other nominees would need a POC to bring in those voters, but Joe doesn’t, and Pete is still a minority. I think there’s a good chance.
Ha ha ha, right??? I could still cry thinking about the Iowa speech!
I would feel really proud to have someone like Pete as Secretary of State...representing US on the international stage.
Yeah, I know that part, last January.
Given how genuine his emotion seemed and the fact that he is generally not very good at showing emotion, I would say he definitely did not know. I am very similar to Pete in that it's hard for me to show my emotions. I know that I would not be able to fake choke up no matter how hard I tried.
you'll have to settle for an Anthony
Even so, a prominent position on his admin like sec of state would help bring Pete into the national arena and set him up for success in the next presidential election. Joe said in a longer version of this speech (you can see it on his Facebook page) that he told Pete he wanted him on his team if he dropped out. That's definitely signaling some kind of role. Very exciting!
He should have a woman at least as VP.
Especially since at the time I hadn't yet gotten used to the idea of \*Pete\* getting choked up. Chasten had gotten emotional a few times in speeches at that point but Pete was normally less visible about expression emotion midspeech, so that one hit me like a truck.  I think that was the exact moment I switched from "I'm a big supporter of Pete's" to "I WOULD SLAY A DRAGON WITH MY FISTS IF YOU ASKED"
LOL. Crawl across broken glass? Sure, don't have to ask me twice!
Did you mean [https://imgur.com/a/YCvA6e7](https://imgur.com/a/YCvA6e7)
Nice! Hadn't seen that one!
Biden unveils extensive LGBTQ plan, drawing on Obama-era achievements
Good. The LGBT community needs a lot of anti-discrimination protections. This includes national work place discrimination protections, housing protections, adoption protections, to name a few. Biden is the best remaining candidate on LGBT rights.
I run a blood bank.    The gay blood ban is fucking stupid and ONLY based on stigma at this point. All units are tested for dozens of diseases, including HIV1-2.     It needs to go YESTERDAY.    The data is settled and we are in **desperate** need of donors country-wide.    I see his stance is to "work with the FDA" which isn't a "no", but when other candidates have said flatly "end it" this sits in contrast.    I hope Joe gets some better advice on this specific matter and changes his mind soon.
I was told Biden isn’t progressive /s
Biden keeps going back to Obama - which I get. But he also needs to do more than “we’re going back to Obama <insert policy> and adding to it!” Even if that’s what they’re doing, he needs to rebrand his messaging.
I like it even if I loved the more comprehensive LGBTQ plans of other candidates. If he's really trying to make a successor out of Pete it'll pay off to start off by asking a gay politician about the blood donation ban. Or perhaps him asking for expert opinions will yield the same conclusion progressives and science came to anyways: it's dumb and homophobic.
I wish his team had talked with the scientists at the FDA before writing out this plan. The ban on blood donation for men who have sex with men needs to change, but the way they have it laid out isn’t good enough. Primarily because it continues to suggest the use of a year-long period. We have known for a long time that HIV can be detected so much earlier than that.
I hope this is a sign of things to come. Now that Biden has secured the spot of being the coalition candidate, he needs to start doing more vision building to compete with Sanders and eventually Trump. A vision built around American moral leadership is particularly good for Biden because it plays into his strengths and his brand.
Good to hear. Excited that he is speaking on this subject. I'm a Bi for Biden!
Does this mean we’re inching closer to VPete?
Thank you Joe
[removed]
[removed]
Can we all agree though, this is probably a policy best suited for his VP to champion on his behalf?      I don't think Joe has a bigotry bone in his body, but I guarantee you, he will flub some sensitive wording on this subject.
Didn’t he ban them from serving in the military?
I’m a gay man that works with leukemia/lymphoma and bone marrow transplant patients. My patients need blood and platelet transfusion as well as medications that are made using donated blood products. There have been shortages of these (especially the medications which are critical for some of my patients). It’s so stupid that we unnecessarily cut out a portion of the population, and one that historically has been charitable in all other ways except this one.
could you write his campaign? See if you can't get this message to him.
I agree with you in principle, but it seems to be working, so...I can't really complain
I think the messaging works. My parents aren't too politically involved but when they hear Obama they get excited. When they see Biden, They see a guy who's promising a 3rd term of Obama, which is what made them vote for him Tuesday
Im 25 and the word Obama-Biden Democrat excites me.  That being said, I was born and raised in a city (Miami, FL) where kids were running and screaming in excitement and joy when Obama was elected and re-elected.
I somewhat disagree...for the moment. For whatever reason, I can't put my finger on it, but "Biden's plan to..." feels like a non-starter. It instantly feels outdated no matter what it is, somehow even more so than actually resurrecting the name of Obama.       However, the second he chooses a VP, it sound fine.       The Biden/Harris plan to...   The Biden/Buttigieg plan to...   The Biden/Yang plan to...      It's weird, but it feels right.
This is my gripe too, especially before Iowa. A lot of his plans are pretty big, but the branding makes it seem like status quo. Of course a lot of that criticism is mostly bad faith in the first place, but it sticks because of how he presents himself.
Yeah that donation ban never made sense to me. People who are diagnosed will be screened out before they donate, and the blood will be tested leading to a diagnosis of the people who don't know yet.
It really needs to be a woman. Preferably an African American. Hopefully Stacey Abrams.
[removed]
Which is exactly why it should be Pete to be his running mate. I'd like a female vice president, but I'd like a female president first.
Didn't he repeal DADT w/ Obama?  He also pushed Obama on the issue.
No. He supported DADT... and the only alternative to that at the time was outright banning LGBT people from serving. In today’s world DADT seems cruel but 20 years ago it was the best we could do to allow gay service members to continue serving.  Context matters.
Couldn't tell you the last time platelets weren't on medical approval.    Now with COVID it's gonna be even worse.      We are standing on the edge of a cliff.
There an email?
I mean - maybe mix it up a little then. 🤷🏼‍♀️
It's working in the primary, but I think Joe's got to address the stuff that led to us having Trump in the first place.  That's my biggest worry about his candidacy.  How can he govern when he thinks Trump is an aberration?  How will he stand up to McConnell?
The thing is - imho - while this messaging works for people like your parents, it may have limited appeal for those who backed Sanders and Warren.
On the flip side though, pointing to the fact they got it done in the Obama years DESPITE Mitch McConnell is what encourages me that Joe can get it done now. The Senate is going to be close either way, so most of what we're going to get is either going to have to peel off GOP votes or be passed via reconciliation(which is budgets only), or via executive orders. If we take the Senate with even one vote, we can start unfucking the courts as well, so that'll help a lot. We also get to bring things to the floor instead of McConnell, which will help drag some GOP votes along.
As a woman, I think Pete is one of Joe's best options. Pete is a minority. And women love him. I can't speak about the black community's views on representation through the VP though.
[removed]
My heart would love it to be Pete, but I wasn't trying to explicitly imply that.
Is opening up blood donations to gay people going to change this?
I would guess you could start with the website. if you are in a state with a campaign office, that's even better, but they've not had a really solid operation til now.
> the stuff that led to us having Trump in the first place  Like what, specifically?
Seems like we're seeing through these primaries that Sanders supporters don't make up a huge part of the electorate anyway. Focus more on getting out the apathetic vote and don't worry so much about the naive children's vote
[deleted]
So you mean the minority within his own party. If Sanders and Warren supporters want to sit it out or vote Trump in retaliation then they can go ahead and do so, I can live with the consequences, if they can as well then good for them, they got money like me.
It didn't appeal to enough people in the 2016 general, either.
I just feel like it should be a woman because it seems like a female VP would be a huge first step in getting a female president one day. Also, I feel like a younger female minority would sort of counter balance Joe’s old-white-man-ness. Since both candidates are old white men, the field could use some diversity.   African American’s already love him, so having an African American on the ticket would be awesome representation for their community. He already floated Stacy abrams before he announced his candidacy I’m pretty sure.
I agree. I think he already does well with the black community & don’t necessarily think he needs a younger AA woman as VP. Although, I agree I would love a female VP.   Pete is a minority & would balance him out, IMO.   Interestingly, Clyburn’s endorsement helped Biden immensely in SC & his grandson is supporting Pete, so I think there’s a good relationship already there if Biden chooses Pete as VP or a high member of the cabinet.
[removed]
It’s not the key to solving the problem, but it’s certainly going to help.   But one of the best examples is the aftermath of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. The Latinx queer community was targeted with over a hundred killed or wounded. They needed blood, but members of their own community were legally but unnecessarily banned from helping their brothers and sisters.
As far as blood product availability yes!    More donors = more blood!    If COVID gets really bad, it's going to put a drag on the entire system. People will be screened out and units will be tested.
Tysm I'll look
Having a black president and a country full of angry rednecks. Joe's already got that half covered
Like systemic racism, the tolerance of white supremacy, an economy in the toilet, Republican intractability, Regulatory capture, Corporate power, Oligarchy... its a long list honestly.    Trump is a symptom.  He didn’t just show up one day.  He was elected.  Americans like him.    If you don’t know what the problems are how you be trusted to fix them?
Sooooo many people confuse Medicare for All with Universal Health Care. All these articles that come out and say M4A is good - the pros are all general to UHC....  People will say, “we’ll that’s what they have in Japan!” - not quite....  the evidence shows that when people *actually* learn about Bernie’s specific plan for M4A, that favorability goes down. I’ve actually had a little luck using the ROTR to have meaningful discussions on UHC, and even got a Bernie supporter to think about the pros of Germany’s program. 💙💛
Reminder: Plenty of ex-Sanders and Warren supporters here now so be civil.   I think instead of saying “you’re the minority in the party” it’s better to stress that these issues can be worked out after we have control of the Congress.  We know Joe and his White House are going to put his plan forward.  However, if there’s plenty of Warren-minded or Sanders-minded Democrats on any particular issue, then they’ll have the opportunity to put it forward (and perhaps get their vision passed).  One of Joe’s main talking points is he wants to work with Congress—get Congress back to fulfilling it’s Constitutional role in debating policy and making law.   Ever since we lost the Congress in 2010 and the GOP obstructed everything Obama attempted, we’ve unfortunately had to lean on the imperial Presidency and thus hope the rules and views of the Executive Branch decide everything.  It doesn’t have to be this way.
I doubt you'll be this smug if the election results in a fracturing of the Democratic party and long-term Republican control of government.   Or maybe you will, if this comment is any indication of who you are as a person.
the only reason we have trump is because the republican primary is winner-take-all instead of proportional like the democratic primary. if they had proportional voting we'd be dealing with President Rubio right now.
It is pretty clear to the Warren supporters that neither of the old white male candidates will accomplish anything.  Joe won’t because he doesn’t want to.  Bernie won’t because he can’t convince anyone to work with him.   So we have no home.  And the supporters of both candidates seem to be smug assholes.  Bernies supporters are so bad he had to tell them to knock it the fuck off.  A quick perusal of this sub today has convinced me I don’t belong here.    Joe?  Bernie?  I honestly don’t care.  They are functionally identical.    Just not Trump.    Neither campaign inspires hope.  Which is not a good look going into the general.
Go tell that to the Bernie supporters who are claiming they’ll vote trump or sit it out if he doesn’t get the nomination. I’m voting for joe, what more do you want?
Wow.  You are a Joe Biten supporter.
What makes you think Joe doesn't want to change anything?
joe will sign anything that gets to his desk. you want him to pass progressive policies, you need to flip the senate.
I want you and others to stop marginalizing minority opinions, primarily. If the only views that will be catered to are those of the majority, why should the others bother to show up? Everyone within the party should be represented, not just whoever has enough votes behind them to ignore everyone else.   &#x200B;  Also, the flaunting of your privilege with comments like "I can live with the consequences" is pretty gross. In the event of Trump being reelected, I doubt everyone will be so lucky as you.
I think he would like you to stop being an asshole.  Hasn’t he been clear about that?
i'm all in on diamond joe 30330 jack
My comment should serve to mobilize the people that will be tossed into the void with another 4 years of trump. If comments like mine don't, then they are truly lost.
He seems quite invested in my online persona. I am quite entrancing, I admit.
\>If comments like mine don't, then they are truly lost.  &#x200B;  Please read this again to yourself a few times, because it stinks of unearned arrogance. Why in the world would you ever think divisive, dismissive comments like yours will motivate *anyone?*
Being tossed into the void by republicans = sufficient motivation. If it is not sufficient motivation for someone then they are too far gone for me to communicate with. Poverty may simply be their destiny at that point.

Bloomberg supporter here. We are ready to unite behind joe. Is there a chance Bloomberg gets vp
Stop commenting "[Candidate] will be VP" with certainty. Any comment like that is purely speculative, probably heavily biased, and not especially helpful.
Definitely not but welcome anyways! We’d  love to have you.
Do you think we will see Bloomberg on the campaign trail with joe
Welcome!
Many of us ex-Bloomberg supporters here.  Welcome home.
I really don't see it, no.  He doesn't get Biden any voters that he probably wouldn't already get.  Plus I think it would look kind of shady considering all the money Bloomberg is going to pump into this race.
Not trying to be blunt, but HIGHLY unlikely.
I don’t think we’ll really see Bloomberg on the campaign much because he will basically be a solo super pac for Biden and he’s technically not allowed to communicate with Biden’s team if that happens
As said last night, Biden owes the black community an unpayable debt for this resurgence. They have to make a black woman the VP and several top cabinet positions will be filled with black talent.
I don't think Bloomberg wants to be VP, he just wants to beat Trump and I imagine Biden would try to do some traditional balancing of the ticket if he's the nominee.
If there are places where Mike can help get votes for Joe, then Joe will appear with him. Seems unlikely. Thing is for sure, Joe will welcome Mike’s massive field and TV and direct mail efforts to promote the Democratic ticket and our platform. All hands on deck.
Vp will either be a black person or mitt Romney I’m not gonna lie
need a woman VP imo.
Why do u support bloomberg
No
I mean
Bloomberg would be very valuable in New York
Doubtful, but Treasury Secretary could be in the mix
Who was that girl that gave the speech endorsing biden the other day
I think it’s gonna be Stacey abrams as VP
Wdym
I can't imagine bloomberg wanting VP? Doesn't really seem like the kind of guy to play 2nd fiddle to someone else
True
Not Vp, but I’m sure he’ll be in the administration
In what role
There’s no way Bloomberg will get vp. We would lose the election.
Although he will help bring out votes in New York
Not sure, but definitely one of the major ones, I’d guess maybe EPA?
He should get a cabinet spot at least
I could see him as secretary of state
I’d be really happy if he gets EPA
I imagine he's already promised Klobuchar or Buttigieg VP
That’s the most important job right now, and he’s definitely the most qualified
No, I think It’ll be Stacey abrams for VO
VP*
He would be perfect for Secretary of State
He would know how to manage things
What about EPA
We need a rounded out ticket. My personal favorite is Susan Rice.
I don't think Bloomberg did all of this for nothing. He'll get something. I think its Kamala or Abrams, but we'll see. Bloomberg will likely have a role though, IMO.
That’s his specialty- EPA
If he had enough delegates to play kingmaker he could demand the VP position.  That doesn't look likely though.    All he has is money now, and that's probably only good for a cabinet post like Treasury.
I think his management record will propel him to sos
Biden will most likely pick someone much younger than himself for VP
True
But what do you think his chances are for sos
Bloomberg proved himself to be a man of his word today, and I respect that. I think Biden would be very very wise to form an immediate taskforce featuring ALL of the former candidates including Bloomberg, Harris, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Booker, etc to examine how to bring life into the party and re-enfranchise the vote.
True
I will always love Bloomberg for his record in New York
No, sorry. Bloomberg is too old to be VP. Moreover we need to balance the ticket, probably with a capable Black woman like Kamala Harris.
My money is on him for sos
I'm pulling for Pete to be the VP, but I also completely understand why someone like Stacy Abrams makes complete sense.
VP slot should go to someone younger in my opinion and adding another White guy to the ticket adds nothing to the equation. As others suggested in the thread, EPA will be a nice place for Bloomberg to work on climate change.
[removed]
I think Biden has explicitly talked about picking someone young for VP.
Bloomberg supporter here as well. Bloomberg would do more good for the country in the private sector than he could as VP, so I hope not. Biden should have a young and exciting VP.
I doubt it. I don't think their is anything he brings to the ticket that he doesn't can't do off the ticket. Someone like Tammi or Beto would make a lot more since.
I think a Latino VP would be the move, if Biden can extract the Latino vote from Bernie and give them a better option than Trump, I think Joe has a good chance
Bloomberg’s resources should absolutely go into a negative ad campaign against Trump, just telling people to vote for Democrats
Any particular reason you made this a live thread? It's more of a PITA to moderate.
I believe the VP is very likely to be an African American woman or a Hispanic male
I am glad he did the right thing and endorsed Biden, but #teampbj is the mvp
He needs a young counterpart, no offense to Bloomberg.
I'm thinking Secretary of the Treasury.  It's what Mike would want.
he's most likely going to pick someone of color and someone younger
lol no. His money will be put to good use though
i think it will be between Stacey, Kamala, Booker and pete
I think we need a progressive VP to expand the base
imo Booker best pick but I think very likely kamala
Warren as head of FTC would be amazing
I think he needs a female VP to go up against Haley once Trump blames Pence for coronavirus and drops him.
The ideal VP pick is someone from a swing state more progressive than Joe and a woman of color tbh
not a chance, sorry bud
I think Tammy Duckworth would be awesome but she’s from Illinois which ain’t exactly a swing state
Stacie abrams
Biden/Harris
It’s not impossible but I don’t think so for multiple reasons: 1. Mike is a leader and not really a good team member. That’s okay because we also need leaders but there can only be one president and I fear that he would undercut Biden’s authority. 2. He’s bringing nothing to the electoral map. Yes he would do well with moderate republicans but the most important thing is turnout and having significant support in swing states (both is not the case. On the other hand he could be what Lieberman was to McCain 3. He’s really unpopular with the left and we need their turnout this will hurt us more than it will help with republicans. 4. He doesn’t have the connections into the senate over which he is presiding. Therefore he can’t help too much to get legislation done.
I am afraid a Bloomberg VP pick would cause more problems than it would solve. Perhaps an appointment to Climate Czar if Mike would want that, but VP needs to be someone that broadens the base.
Whitmer he needs a Midwest woman
Welcome.  No.
Black vote is locked up as primary shows need someone in the Midwest to be competitive for OH WI MI
Yang, Bloomberg should have spots in the cabinet.  But yes, it has to be a midwestern ally.  Preferably a woman. Klobuchar
I’d love for Sherrod Brown to be considered but the optics of another all white male ticket isn’t good
I don't think Bloomberg would be a good VP for Biden.  Biden needs someone younger and that could contrast him.  Klobuchar would be my guess, but he could go out of the box as well.
The best candidates would be: - Pete: Trust and affection with Biden and he sees the future of the party in him. Showed in Iowa that he can flip and turn out voters in Trump counties - Klobuchar: She is the most effective senator and can carry the crucial Midwest states - Duckworth: Just an amazing senator
Bloomberg wins you New York
New York's going blue no matter who the VP is
i would love pete to be vp. Im afraid it would lose Joe general because if moderate republicans and his lack of experience
Most likely Warren is VP
more likely to be made supreme leader of space force than VP
Biden is working with Warren this election already, that's why she's staying in to hurt Bernie and in return she'll get VP
I'm not sure what he brings to the table tho... Kamala brings more diversity, pete brings strong support from white suburban voters who went for Trump...
he should start pouring money in adds for biden, and to Stacey abrams effort to register voters
No and here’s why: a VP pick is 100% political and is used in order to broaden a candidates coalition. Bloomberg and Biden have the same coalition of moderate dems/independents/former republicans who want to beat both Bernie and Trump. Buttigieg and Klobuchar also *mostly* have that same coalition. Biden needs a running mate who can reach out to groups OUTSIDE of his coalition. I’d bet he’ll be going for a women who is a POC (I’m betting Stacy Abrams) or a latinx individual (maybe Julian Castro).
I think Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto would be an awesome pick, also former attorney general of Nevada for 2 terms
Good God
No
Tell me this isnt Bloomberg on a smurf account
Not a full-fledged supporter, but I've been defending him for weeks. Now I'm just happy that we're all on the Biden train!   AND IT HAS NO BRAKES
absolutely no chance of VP. The coalition welcomes the resources and funds, but simply cannot entertain the idea of a Bloomberg VP. America has spoken, and loudly expressed not being okay with a man buying his way into power regardless of merit.
Another good reason to vote for Joe
Someone please put her in an isolation chamber until next year. She has a very good chance of not surviving COVID-19 if she gets infected.
I was going to say thank god you need a law degree to be a Supreme Court justice, but I googled it and you don’t. The founding fathers really overestimated us.
She should have retired under Obama
Vote by mail!!!
Or Judge Jeanie or that woman judge that was on Trump’s list for SCOTUS.
Why would she be replaced by Sarah Palin?
*Sarah Palin gets appointed to SCOTUS*  Me, an atheist: God. Heavenly Father. Jesus. Holy Spirit, take me home.
VoteRBG^NO^MATTER^WHO

“With” not “by.”
I don't mean to be morbid, but even if she died today, the Dems are owed one over the Merrick Garland bullshit. They would claim "It's an election year! No justices can be confirmed," and filibuster any nominee.
There were very few in any formal law degrees at the time, so it would have been awkward to have an entry norm solidified in the Constitution in the late 18th century that practically no one from the new country could meet
They blocked his nominee to replace Scalia.
I think the justices make whatever decisions are best for them and it's up to the politicians to sort it out whatever happens after.  I think they're too smart to make their major life decisions around reading the political tea leaves.
Maybe this was all part of her plan
Yeah, it’s her prerogative, but it was kind of irresponsible not to.
Yes let’s get the word out about what’s really at stake in November. I think the future of the Supreme Court is the issue that will bring progressives and moderates together.
Because Donald Trump is an idiot and he will get two or three more judges.
Because it’s a bad meme
I think they “replaced with Sarah Palin”
[removed]
[removed]
Technically you are right. But memes aren’t exactly known for their grammatical correctness. As long as people know what it means.   It’s a meme. Spread it!
There’s no filibuster for any nominee iirc
They would need to control the Senate for that.
Good point!
And even then, postgraduate law degrees only became the norm since WWII. Prior to that, the LLB was more common.
[removed]
She’s 86, lol.  She put her own selfish needs before the need of the many.
Beyond the SCOTUS, the entire judicial branch of the US government. Trump has flooded the appellate courts with his uncompromising, conservative justices.
Yes either way, the point of the meme is to remind progressive’s what’s really at stake in November. We’ve got time to home this message and get it out there.
[removed]
It's not a great meme.  Here's why, of all the judges that Trump has appointed to the to the 9th circuit, which one do you think is to the most Sarah Palin like? Which do you think is the least qualified?  I suspect you don't have an answer ready and you'd have to Google something.   Maybe you'd Google Trump judge appointment rating and you'll find something like this: As of February 3, 2020, the American Bar Association (ABA) had rated 220 of President Trump's nominees. Of these nominees, 150 were rated "well-qualified," 61 were rated "qualified," and 9 were rated "not qualified." Seven of the nine individuals rated as "not qualified" have been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Trump is a Trainwreck. There are so many reasons to dislike him, but his judge appointments are not terrible.   Also, Sarah Palin?? Wtf? No. That's more stupid than when conservatives were saying if Hillary gets elected she is gonna appointment Obama to the Supreme Court.  Edti: typo
Yup. They switched from a 60 vote threshold to break scotus filibusters to 51 in 2017 when they confirmed Gorsuch.  Unfortunately, it was Harry Reid who started that trend with non-scotus judicial appointees.
That’s why you came to r/JoeBiden? To blame Obama for what the Republicans did?
Commander Spock over here.
Exactly! That’s way more important than the individual policies of the president. If progressives don’t vote because they order Bernie to Biden then we’re going to end up with conservative judges for a long long time.   That’s a message that should get through to them.
No problem. Make a better meme and post that one too.   Let’s just get the word out that if progressives sit out the election because Bernie didn’t win the nomination then we’ll lose a lot more than the presidency.
Tbf, Senate was blue until 2014. She could have retired then and another judge would have easily gotten confirmed
I like Obama.   But it doesn’t mean I’m a blind follower willing to overlook our politician’s faults.  At the end of the day they’re all just politicians.  They’re not gods, lol.
Ambassador.
I tried to explain this to a hardcore Bernie supporter recently and he did not understand how SCOTUS works.  At all.  Then he was like 🤷‍♀️ "Congress is about to make abortion illegal anyway.".
Republicans werent that crazy at that time though so it wasnt expected that they would do the "no hearings a year before the election" stuff
Ok but this is a meme meant to spread the word about what’s at stake in the election. Memes don’t capture the entire story. Just spread it on social media! It’s funny and scary at the same time
My bad.  Live long and prosper.
There’s a lot of misinformation out there, and I’m very sorry to say that Bernie’s supporters (or people claiming to be Bernie supporters) are a big source of it.
Nation's largest union, NEA, endorses Biden for president
NEA > NRA
Can’t to see this at the top of r/politics
Union strong!
The workers have spoken. There shall be no malarkey
I will say it again and again. We need to make this happen to save our country! Let's go Joe!
Exactly. Well written.
QUEEN RANDI
Damn Joe Biden has a subreddit?
Is Biden for or against unions?
[removed]
#FUCK YEAH!!  I’m a proud NEA member.  Fuck the NRA, and fuck Bernie Sanders.  Biden wants people to die because he doesn’t support M4A?  Bernie has actually condemned children to death with his soft stance on guns.
Upvote here so it shows up on r/all.
I'm in the NEA and I didn't get a say in who was endorsed. Makes you wonder who makes these decisions and how much merit they really hold?
Right ? When I see the neverbiden b.s. I start to wonder, were they ever ‘for’ the country ? Save OUR country, why is this concept so tough ?
Biden is blue Trump, are you blind?
Not all of us are old lol
We grew by literally 100% the week of Super Tuesday. If you're new, you're in good company!
For: https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/  > As president, Biden will:  > Check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws  > Encourage and incentivize unionization and collective bargaining  > Ensure that workers are treated with dignity and receive the pay, benefits, and workplace protections they deserve.
Malarkey spotted👆
I’m in favor of Biden, but don’t like “fuck Bernie Sanders.” This is way over the top and not fair to Senator Sanders.  Joe would not approve.
reminder that Bernie's the only candidate who wants to TAKE AWAY your health insurance
Please remember the rules of the road this subreddits has adopted.  We as Democrats owe Senator Sanders so much for, if nothing else, simply moving the national discourse leftward perhaps more than any other human being in the last 50 tears. Joe Biden's healthcare plan would not be considered moderate if not for Bernie. His carbon plan would not be considered moderate if not for Bernie. His education plan would not be moderate if not for Bernie.  Eight years ago, these ideas weren't even in the table, and even Democrats were hesitant to vote for them out of how radical they seemed.  Bernie Sanders did not have my vote for president, but he has my respect as a politician and a human being. Thank you, Bernie.
[removed]
They surveyed their workers and listened to what they said.
it's just spiteful and shortsighted in my opinion. They are just using their emotions to make decisions rather than logic. politics is a Game of chess you need to consider the mid and end game not just the opening. If your guy doesn't do well you need to throw in with the next closest candidate to your guys policies that has a chance of winning. At this point that is Biden. Sanders mathematically cannot win. He is wasting his supporters money at this point IMO. He is also working to weaken our best hope for saving this nation. If he really cared about this country and this party he would get out and put all his effort behind getting Biden elected.
nah... neither Bernie or Biden are blue Trump. Trump has never done anything in government and has no idea what it means to be a public servant. I do worry a bit about some of how Bernie's ideas tend to divide people and the party but I think that is unintentional on his part. Trump is dividing up people completely on purpose. We would do well to have either Bernie or Biden as president. However I like Biden's approach more and he has a lot more foreign policy experience than Bernie does. Our foreign relations are all messed up. Bernie is mostly a domestic policy guy which is fine but we need someone that is strong both in foreign and domestic policy. Also we need someone who is going to make more measured changes and that can build consensus within party with republicans. Biden has a much better chance at that than Bernie.
Right! I'm 27 years old here and I'm a proud Obama-Biden democrat.
Hey there's some old people on reddit too!
There are dozens of us!
Thanks
Something tells me he might not encourage us, but he’s not going to disagree.  Joe hates malarkey just as much as the rest of us, and Bernie is full of it.  Sorry, I’m just really sick of the purity tests and the holier than thou attitude of Bernie’s supporters.
Nah, it's totally fair. Fuck Bernie Sanders.
Bernie Sanders handed us Trump and may do it again.  It's rare to have a candidate with enough experience to start the job fully prepared on day 1. Hillary was such a candidate and so is Joe. Bernie tore down one and is trying to tear down another.  Just like last time when he had no chance of winning after ST, he's doing to stay in this until the convention and his attempts to encourage his supporters to vote for Joe in November. And for what? His ego?  Fuck Bernie Sanders. He is an enemy to the Democratic party. He deserves no sympathy
Right. Sanders can still make great progress in the Senate. We need to continue to support some of his vision. Senators are elected not appointed.
I’m in an odd position where M4A would actually be super helpful for me personally.  I don’t have insurance right now.  I’m a substitute teacher employed through a contractor, so through some loophole they don’t have to offer insurance.  My state hasn’t expanded Medicaid, and the Marketplace is too expensive.  But were I a full time teacher employed by a school district you’d be absolutely correct.  When I was a para I had medical, dental, and vision with my premiums fully subsidized.  I paid a little extra for buy-up dental and vision, but that was it.  Something like $12 out of every paycheck.  Unfortunately it’s not great if you have to cover a spouse and/or children as they don’t subsidize dependent premiums at all.
And replace it with something better. Your post is entirely disingenuous and silly: the nation would be a better place with Medicare for All, and the fact that some people have moderately less awful healthcare today does not mean we should not work as hard as we can to eliminate for-profit healthcare.
Yeah but the reason a gun exists is to take life away,  not a car. That's why we should hold gun manufacturers accountable.
No they didn't.
> If he really cared about this country and this party he would get out and put all his effort behind getting Biden elected.  That's your job.  Bernie has made the case for his values and only around 30% of primary voters are going to push those as a priority based on polling.  His supporters are the ones who want him to stay in the race expressly for the game.
19 year old Hillarycrat here. Joe Biden 2020💎💎
Got you beat— 9 years younger and voted for Joe :)
My people!
I agree that lots of Bernie supporters are divisive, but we shouldn’t be doing the same. We are trying to build a big tent party of unity and tearing each other down gets us nowhere. Lets talk about how great our candidate is and not focus on Bernie’s shortcomings.  Biden has specifically been trying to reach out to Sanders’s supporters now that the primary appears to be winding down.  We should do the same.
Seconded. Fuck Sanders
Make progress naming post offices?  He's completely useless there and he's damaging in the primary
Something "better" in name only. His M4A plan would fail HARD in practice.
it really is not my job. I am not getting on stage and running ads trying to weaken Biden and his campaign. That is what Bernie and his campaign are doing. If he is running all these negative pieces on Biden how is he really going to throw in his support at the end of the day? It's always going to come across as underhanded now.
Nah, fuck Bernie Sanders and the Bernie or bust people he actively facilitates. By waiting 2 months after it was mathematically impossible for him to win and by staying in now, I've lost what little respect I had for him.
I think if Biden wins the nomination, Democrats will win the House and Senate. Biden already shows he can compromise and he agrees with some of Sander’s proposals. So I think Sanders may have a good chance to sponsor some much needed changes in this country. We may not all agree but both Sanders and Biden’s proposals are better than Trump’s failures.
The current healthcare system is failing HARD in practice.
Yes. And replacing it with something worse isn't helpful.l
If I were Joe Biden this billboard would be my entire campaign.
That sounds like a good spend of some Bloomberg bucks to me!
Lol this is an asshole who’s never had to save in a 401k in his life
BTW, stock market value is just 300 points off from going below from the day Trump got inagurated.
Another gem.  >[The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339) — President Donald Trump (February 24, 2020)
It's one banana Michael, what could it cost? Ten dollars?
What’s a 409K? I don’t have that.. am I in trouble?
The orange dumbass was bragging the other day about the largest gain in history, now he has two of the largest drops and crickets.  Fucking hell get this orange sack of shit out of the office in November and let the criminal prosecutions begin.
It’s the antithesis of what most expect, but I’d love a campaign from Joe that doesn’t even mention this president. I think a reason we have Trump is because of the attention given to him.  If we don’t mention him, but instead focus on bettering the lives of those he left behind, that’d be my strategy.
> 409K  Lmao
I love seeing these examples of how stupid and short-sighted he is.  See also, thinking it's safe to defund disease control because pandemics never happen!
I disagree. Let Trump’s idiocy and hypocrisy speak for itself. People already know what they think of him. Biden should appear presidential and focused on working people rather than spending too much time on Trump’s level
Generally I would only put some or none of the blame for bad markets on the sitting President, but when he constantly brags about it and uses it as an indicator of his success, he also has to eat the losses too.
While the stockmarket may have been doing great it isnt because any policy he implemented. but its beginning to fail because of his complete incompetency
I can't wait for this asshole to lose and get eaten alive by his own party.
Vincent Adultman, is that you?
Trump needs to be attacked on the issues, not his awful personality if the economy is bad
I actually don’t think this will be very effective. Covid-19 gives him an excuse —- “yeah the market is down but it’s because of a worldwide massive natural disaster, remember before covid how good things were going thanks to me?”  Instead, i think the tweets and sound bites where he and his cronies are minimizing the pandemic and calling it a liberal hoax are way more damning.  Also pushing back on the idea that the economy was so amazing before covid. Im not an expert but I haven’t seen a single economic measure that has changed trajectory from Obama’s time in office.  PS how the hell did he type “409k” - can’t be a simple typo, 1 and 9 are nowhere near each other! Maybe voice to text?
To be fair, the market will certainly recover to some degree by the election, unless there's a really worst case scenario. We'll see what happens.
NOT EVERY WORD THAT ENDS IN S NEEDS AN APOSTROPHE. SOMETIMES THEY ARE PLURAL. OMFG.
What will that change nothing how Biden would have done Dick all the fix what has happened. The government doesn’t roll out big carpets for everyone you have to get along yourself poor planing on anyone’s part is the fault of the person. This is what happens when you rely on government to fix your problems.
Totally.
Yeah but I'd rather Bloomberg spend a billion dollars to help all the people in NY who are going to be out of work for two months
Well you clearly didn't listen to the president, he's talking about your 409k. Stupid liberal.
You. Are. Fuckt.   This is the new retirement plan that came out this year. How did you miss this bigot (<— i am keeping that, though will say that I typed ‘bigly’ and it autocorrected to ‘bigot’) news?
If you had one, it's way below a 408k by now  ^(/terrible personal finance joke)
See, you say that, but Trump hatred drove voters to the polls in droves in the midterm.
Are the 409ks the reason grocery stores have to ID you at check out lines?
That’s what Mikey the attack dog is for
[removed]
In this case the market is fluctuating due to poor emergency response which is probably fair to lay at Trump's feet
This is untrue. He enacted crazy stimulus measures during an economic boom, cut taxes on companies allowing them to buy back their stock (something that used to be illegal) and drove prices through the roof. He took our emergency action kit and used it to goose the markets to raise his approval rating with near-retirement boomers.   He is 100% responsible, both for the climb and the crash.
This is on the issues. Have you seen the market response to Trump badly bungling this pandemic?
I mean there is a very fair point to be made that America's slow, anemic, and poor response to covid 19 is very much a separate point and a contributing factor to the downturn.  Also the Trump adminstrations economic policy is vastly different from the Obama administration  Ignoring ancillary things like healthcare or climate change, the Trump adminstration withdrew us from the TPP and replaced NAFTA, he's a protectionist (boo hiss), trump, partially repealed the Dodd Frank act, made changes to the tax code, and engaged us I a number of disruptive trade wars
Most experts at this point are expecting a recession at minimum
I firmly believe is the power of the individual, but society's that succeed are ones that enable the indiivual to have incentive and ability to engage in the economy to better their own life. Trump's trade policy and his innefectiveness at adminstration have probably now slowed or stalled one of America's best periods of economic expansion. We aren't looking for a government to fix out problems but a government that won't incite trade wars to cause problems and reduce out ability to participate in capitalism for our own betterment, and a government that can provide basic services to relieve acute suffering for those who need it.  Oppurtunity, and a minimum floor that we agree no one should live below, it's a pretty Rock solid idea
I mean, realistically he could probably easily handle both.
I hate that fucker so much I’m giving free rides to any of my coworkers needing one to vote in November.
We will still hate him if we stop talking about him. Believe me.
Scorched earth motherfucker
Of course you’re going to say that...you are a Trump fan, and you are more scared of him going up against Biden than Sanders.
There’s a lot more to it than just that. Come on. I do obviously agree that the emergency response from this administration was poor, especially at the beginning which is the most critical hour, and I think they deserve a lot of blame for that; but the market would be rough right now even if they had a better response.   With that being said even doing the right thing is going to hurt the market. Closing down stores and canceling events and such is good because it helps contain the spread of the virus, but it’s definitely not great for markets or the economy. Huge industries are taking a hit. Airlines, tourism, retail, huge pieces of SPX.   Did the lack of action in the beginning hurt the market more? Probably, but not sure how to quantify that.
I agree but I'd phrase it as he's responsible for both the bubble and the pop  Sound economic policy wouldn't have sought %4 annual growth at the expense of regulation
Sorry, I wasn’t clear. I know his policies are different. I just meant that I don’t see any MEASURE of the economy (e.g. GDP, unemployment, the stock market, etc) that looks like it is in a better place than if it just followed the trajectory it was on during Obama’s presidency.   And absolutely the response was terrible, in no small part due to (1) the elimination of the pandemic response team in 2018 and (2) the intentional downplaying of the crisis as a “hoax” by trump and his allies. I just think pointing to the stock market isn’t the best way to do it
Oh for sure, but unless the virus is really lingering I would think there's a partial recovery by November. Not every recession is long term.
Biden is a buffoon.  I can't argue that Trump isn't - he does make a case for buffoonery at times.  But Biden is a horrible candidate.  He is a caricature of a politician. I would rather have Bernie in the White House over Joe.
I think you may be taking my comment more negatively than I intended
That's a very good critism, I agree, and also hopefully people will do it on their own. Biden can avoid get dragged into one of the only things Trump has anything positive to say about and just stick to the nuts and bolts of how poor the pandemic response was
Good point
Ok.  I don’t believe you, but ok.
Most likely, sorry. Stressful week in my industry.   :)
Biden the Buffoon.  You heard it here first.
What do you do friend?
Not gonna be popular here but I work at a trading firm as a software engineer
That's super cool, I have no context for what that would be like outside of being really stressful at the moment
It’s definitely interesting! But yeah generally it’s not super stressful but right now there’s just a lot going on, but we’ll get through it :)
Hey there, new allies! Bernie supporter here.
WELCOME TO THE TENT WE LOVE YOU
Welcome! Go grab yourself an ice cream cone!  In all seriousness, I think as someone who was clearly extremely enthusiastic about Bernie, one of the most beneficial things you could do is talk to other Bernie supporters who are feeling really down rn. I'm seeing a lot of chatter about sitting out or voting Green.
I'm a fellow Bernie supporter, but when the dust settles I'm with our nominee, period, full stop.  Same as I was in 2016, I only hope the results are better this time.  Yeah it's looking pretty much like Biden has this locked up.  Congratulations to all of his supporters.  So if the nominee is Biden, and it looks like it will be, open up and let me in that trans am!
We were allies all along. Now we can focus on our REAL opponent. Good to have you!
Permanent member of Team Pete here, wishing you a warm welcome! One of the things I like most about the Biden crew is how welcoming they've been of supporters of other candidates, and from the comments I can see you've already experienced some of that. I'm sorry things didn't work out with Bernie, but we're glad to have you on board! We're all working towards the same goal, and I think ol' Joe will pleasantly surprise some people along the way :)
Gonna post what I posted in a similar thread earlier today:  ---  Honestly? Look at his website. Read through his platform on a lot of issues. Take note of things that surprised you, and talk about *those* things. You'll find a lot of policies that you'd have no idea Biden supported if you've been stuck in an environment that screams "He's basically a republican" in your ear constantly.  For starters:  * Universal healthcare via expanding free access to government-funded healthcare  * Federal decriminalization of marijuana for all purposes, federal legalization for medical purposes, rescheduling for research purposes, encouraging states to fully legalize if wanted  * $15 federal minimum wage  * Eliminating private prisons  * Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences, and any jail time for drug use  * Ending cash bail  * Pro-nuclear energy with a plan for net-zero emissions by 2050  The biggest lie out there about Joe Biden right now is that he's going to be "more of the same" or "status quo", when in actual reality, this is the most progressive platform from a presidential nominee, ever. Talk about that stuff.
Welcome!  Have an Alligator!  Let’s go forth and vanquish Malarkey!
Welcome!! Glad to have you here!!
Biggest thing in my mind is talking to people on Reddit and IRL and explaining to them a few basic things:  Smelling a woman's hair and having a personal distance/intimacy personality does not make him a bad person and he does have any sexual assault accusations that I am aware of v. Trump who has dozens of women accusing him of various things.  When you know the tragedy of his past, he just looks like someone who knows life is precious and having human bonds with others is a lot more important than always worrying what people think because life if fragile.  Most important thing is that he has a much better chance of beating Trump.  I don't know how many times people on Reddit told me Bernie would inspire more people to vote and that made him better to beat Trump but that's obviously not the case.  Regardless, he is our only chance to beat Trump and failing to do that will result in the end of USA as we know it.  This has only become more extreme of a danger now that Trump has the pretext for martial law etc.  We need to get sane people back to run the country asap to salvage what we can. Maybe the socialist revolution you want will come in the next cycle if the economy is still in shambles and nobody has work.  Welcome to the big tent.
Welcome! I'm also here from Bernie's camp, and it's much better than I expected.  &#x200B;  I'm glad that all the #NeverBiden garbage I've been seeing lately isn't consuming everyone.
Bernie supporter here, thanks for this post.  I agree wholeheartedly. It’s time for unison - I too am riden with Biden (assuming they let NYC folks out to vote...)
Welcome!  We have ice cream, sunglasses, and drums here!  😄
Welcome to the team, friend!!

> new allies  This is where you're wrong.  We've always been allies. We just need to remind everyone of that after the primary.
As for things you can do, there are some options here: https://joebiden.com/take-action/  Of course, the campaign wants donations more than volunteer support right now (there isn't a high need for work right now), but keep that link in mind..
Welcome! We need your help to beat Trump! <3

ya know, all we really need is exactly what you're doing, and that's good faith engagement and an open mind. We welcome you and everyone else.
Hello and welcome!  It's really tough to lose. My condolences.    The Democratic Avengers are assembling to vanquish Thanos, er, Trump.  The passion and vision of Bernie supporters have a place in this campaign.  If your fellow Bernie supporters are dismayed at the top of the ticket, suggest they throw their energy behind a downticket race.   There are races from school board to the Senate being contested, and Republicans need to be challenged in all of them.  You have a better chance of seeing even part of your agenda adopted if you play ball with the whole party and help get Congresspeople and Senators elected.   If Moscow Mitch is still sitting on bills, no form of universal health care can be passed.  Some important races include Sara Gideon vs. Susan Collins in Maine; Amy McGrath vs. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, and Jaime Harrison vs. Lindsey Graham. As far as House races go, pick one and help!  Thank you again and welcome to the big tent.
First off, welcome!  I'm a former Warren supporter myself, but happy to ride with Joe as well now.  I found his speech on Super Tuesday to be especially comforting for the electability argument.  &#x200B;  All the things you outline are always needed by every campaign.  I think that small dollar donations help with the media argument, as an indication of engagement from the electorate.  And as a younger person, you're part of a generation the campaign needs to engage more with, so you're doubly "valuable."  &#x200B;  I might have rose colored glasses on, but I sort of like that Joe doesn't seem as perfect and invincible as Barack or Hillary.  Remember the "Everybody calm the F\*\*\* down, I got this" memes?  You wanted to go and help/volunteer/engage/donate, but there was a feeling of inevitability of their campaigns.  Joe isn't that way.  He will NEED our help.  Despite everything seeming to conspire against tiny hands, we know this fight is going to need everyone.  I like that.  It's going to increase the "ownership" of every donation and volunteer shift.
Welcome!
Everyone is welcome in the Biden 2020 coalition!
Welcome!   I'm sorry that you had to switch candidates, but I'm glad we can all come together for the betterment of our country.
Hey! I caucused for Bernie in 2016 when I lived in Minnesota, I supported him in this campaign. After Super Tuesday, I took a good look at Joe and the turnout he was inspiring and decided to shift my support. Read his platform, it’s progressive. Obviously, I wish Sanders or Warren had done better. But, getting a steady hand in the WH and winning back the Senate is something to be enthusiastic about. And I think that Joe can do it with our help
Welcome!
Welcome to the Joementum!
If Bernie drops out, then Biden will be the best candidate in the race against trump.
Please spread this message to the Bernie friendly subs. They’re currently a cess pool of self righteous loathing and I’m worried that kind of attitude is gonna divide the party as we begin the most important election of our life.   It is not hyperbolic to say this election determines what kind of country we become for the next 20-40 years
Hello fellow Bernie supporter? Are you ok with the public option? Or do you still prefer M4A?
I was a die-hard Bernie supporter in 2016, and I still have the t-shirt, sign, and memories of canvassing to prove it. This year I flopped between Bernie and Liz, but after Super Tuesday, I was in Joe Biden's camp. Biden's the one consistently proving that he can connect with people in the way that we need a leader to right now. I'm not just talking about "electability" here, but being able to assuage anxieties and unite a fractured country. The primary is over, for all real intents and purposes. If you'd asked me a few months ago how I'd feel if Bernie dropped out, I would've expected to feel dismally about it, but now I really do think it's time for him to do so. I'm feeling increasingly confident about Biden.
I have loved Bernie for 6 years, and this is painful, but let's unite and kick Trump's ass! Welcome
Hello and welcome! I was a Bernie supporter back in 2016 so I know how you are probably feeling. Let’s unite and defeat Trump together!!
Welcome to the club
I hate that I only get one upvote for this!  Welcome!  I wasn't originally a Biden supporter, but I like that he's willing to evolve his views based on what the people really want.  I think the best thing you can go is to be an evangelist to your fellow Bernie supporters. To help them understand that the real fight begins, as our republic is headed toward ruin after only 3 years of Trump's malfeasance.  I've got some extra Biden bumper stickers. If you want one, PM me, I can drop one in the mail.
Welcome! I was like you— I supported Bernie at a very young age, I think we might be the same age if I’m doing the math right. Big tent activated let’s go and beat Trump!
Welcome my friend! Stay engages and proactive...together we will defeat this menace in the White House
That's what's up!  Welcome to Ridin with Biden.   Once everyone gets on the same page it's going to be time to steam roll that train wreck in DC, I mean Mara Lago actually.
[removed]
How do you rationalize Joe Biden's efforts to destroy social security, veto medicare for all, and vows about nothing fundamentally changing under his administration? Just gonna suck it up and vote blue no matter what?  If anybody wants wapo articles and literal video of him saying these things, please just ask.
Hear hear!  Bernie was the first candidate I gave money to and volunteered for. Joe isn’t my ideal candidate, but I agree with some of his ideas, and hope he courts other Bernie supporters by bending on M4A and other progressive policies.   Definitely want to bring some enthusiasm to Biden’s campaign.
Welcome aboard! Let's beat Trump and advance the progressive agenda together!
Come check out the Trump sub.  We have more to offer than these chumps.
you guys are all so lovely! glad to be here :)
Yes, there's a much bigger picture to consider: making decency great again, leadership in crisis times, restoring our professional civil service.  Every single one of us, from the most conservative to the most radical, depends on this.  It may also be time for some real talk about how well that worked out in 2016.  I have a relative who voted Jill Stein in 2016 in a state where that made a difference.   We all know how that has worked out since.
Door's open, there's plenty of room :)
fair point - we've had common goals all along. great to be here! :)
This.  Biden has the most progressive platform of any Presidential Nominee in US history.
thank you kindly! vanquishing malarkey is the only thing on my to do list between now and November 3rd! :)
thank you! glad to be here!

Hell yeah dude, and just remember that Obama and Biden got elected in a situation just like the one we are in today. Guess what they did? They took on in a recession and decreased the budget deficit from 1.2 trillion to 600 billion in just 8 years. Of course the genius known as Trump undid that.
I would also encourage you to try to convince others how progressive Biden's platform actually is. You are going to see a lot of bad actors try to convince you that Biden is only running as "not Trump" or the old favorite, "Trump is more Progressive than Biden." You need to make sure no one falls for it.  https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/  https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/joe-biden-platform-progressive-health-care-climate-taxes.html
Awesome.  Just like 2016 I might not get everything I hoped for but it's a damn site better than the alternative.  We need to stop the bleeding and get back to some sort of normalcy.  Let's do this!
/r/GatesOpenComeOnIn
That's right! And if we can retake the Senate, we can actually do a LOT more than just go back to normal. $15 min wage, healthcare access for everyone, tuition free college for most, gun control, climate change, etc.
That can't be stressed enough, we need a sweep.  Not just the White House but we need to take the Senate and we need it bigly.  It's gonna be a straight party ticket from me, and I would encourage anyone else listening to do the same.

I was 1. Biden 2. Amy 3. Pete. I am grateful they understand they need to unite with Biden. I Hope to see her star keep rising!
Former #YangGang and #Klobster making my way here early. I hope Joe will pick Amy for VP.   I was hoping Amy would stay in enough to at least siphon MN voters from Sanders but I’m hoping that the Klobsters there will just vote Joe.
COMEBACK KID
Just came over from team Pete today. Congratulations on the new wind in your sails guys, it must feel amazing.
Hope this is true
MODERATES! ASSEMBLE!
Read it here, because you won’t find it on r/politics.
Bloomfuck, you next please.
I know that everyone here is very happy she dropped out - and I am too on some level - but I will miss her Midwestern mom energy out on the campaign field. I'd love to see her run again in the future, and I'm sure that she would have my vote. Thank you Amy!
I was just in my car listening to radio asking myself when she is going to drop out.  Your turn, Bloomberg!
Phew. I thought she was going to drag it out.
Sorry for supporters of the other campaigns but the past few days have been so energizing. We can really do this.
YEssssss !!!! Just found it here also:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-drops-out.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-drops-out.html)
Yaaaaaas
Klobooya Roll Call!
Battle of Super Tuesday is starting to look like the Battle for the Pellinor Fields, with neoliberals from the Midwest coming to save Uncle Joe in his time of greatest need!  Steer clear the populist tides. For peace! For prosperity! For the dream of a hemispheric common market & for open borders! To a new dawn! And to a new American Spring!  The melodrama aside - I am so proud to see people setting aside their egos to ensure that the party found a candidate that represents us, not a group of loud, brick-throwing radicals.
I have new respect for her now
Great news, thank you Amy!
This has been one of the best days of the cycle. I look forward to the results tomorrow!
Nice! and now Pete needs to follow her suit.
[removed]
YESS THANK YOU JESUS
The Moderates are doing everything they can to stop Bernie
[deleted]
Beto O'Rourke too!! Biden is gonna win TX in an upset!!
[removed]
Exactly the same sequence for me. Sad to see these two leave, but they have made their mark, and they will play bigger role in democratic party in future.   I hope their endorsements will help reduce Bernie's lead over bisen on ST.
She still might get eligibility in MN with early voting, and her support will probably push Biden and Warren into eligibility taking a lot of delegates from Bernie and giving some to Biden. I think this move makes sense.
>  I hope Joe will pick Amy for VP.   I've been Riden with Biden from the beginning, but Amy was a close second for me. I hope she gets the VP spot also. Let's take it to Washington!
Welcome!
MN is 2 for 2 when VP.   HHH and Mondale
Hi fellow #YangGang!   She’d be a great pick. The Midwest loves her, she’s younger, and she’s a woman. Overall, she’s had some of the best debate performances - just never picked up support.
I’m a Klobster from MN. Will vote for Joe tomorrow. There’s at least one of us. Though in fact I think there’s a lot more.
If Biden actually pulls this off, that would be unprecedented. Losing the first three states, but still winning the nomination? He's basically like that scrappy wild card team that gets hot just in time for the playoffs.
I was Team Pete until Saturday night.  Winning feels awesome!!!
And we'll still get a President Pete one day.
I'm just glad it's going to help Bernie do worse in states like Cali. I don't like to bash anyone but Bernie has already started it so...
You’re on this team now as well, friend.   I’ve been in your shoes where my first choice candidate got beat and it sucks.  However, this coalition isn’t really about Joe.  It’s about finding the best candidate we think we can who will bring back the days of Barack Obama, beat Trump, and take back the Congress.   Pete will have his day in the sun again.
It's TRUE. Reported by NYT as well. I'm doing the happy dance as I type. WHOO HOO!!   This party is getting started. I hope you'll permit me an analogy but this feels like the part in Lord of the Rings where Pippin lights the beacons.   THE BEACONS ARE LIT ... THE BEACONS ARE LIT
Let's not call our opponents names (unless it's Bernie) lol.   That's not what Biden or his campaign are about. He wouldn't want that. Actually, he probably wouldn't want us calling Bernie names either but like, the dude makes it hard.
Not bloody likely mate
Oh god me too, I love the heck out of Amy. Her sense of humor really tickled my funny bone. She is a strong policy wonk with excellent capacity to be President. I just respect her so much for dropping out before Super Tuesday. She is doing right by the party.
She’ll still be out there, just plugging for Biden!
> but I will miss her Midwestern mom energy out on the campaign field.   I don't think we've seen the last of Amy K
Reports are that he will be endorsing.
Let’s see if her beating him to the punch encourages him to hop on board today as well.

Jazz Clinton's first win was SC too
Bill Clinton lost the first four state primary elections it in 1992 and still got the nomination - a lot can change as a crowded field thins out.
You’re forgetting Ol’ Slick Willy
I'm still 100% Team Pete, it's just that the best way to show that now is voting for Biden.
Biden 2020, 2024   Klobacher 2028, 2032  Buttigeig 2036, 2040
I don't want to see him get the nomination. I don't like the way his campaign is run. It's a mirror of the way Trump manipulates people's anger. If he does I'm voting for him though. Zero progress in DC is better than where Trump has taken us.
Thank you :) Agree!
No calling Bernie names either. Coalesce around Biden to beat Trump.  Bernie truly wants what is best for the country. As do plenty of his supporters.
[removed]
Literally the original come back kid
I mean, yeah, but I'd hope we don't have to wait 24 more years for a non-white President.
Thanks Bernie Supporter for coming in with this Malarkey and proving you all have nothing better to do but be negative.
That's a good point...  We're so far behind in chill equality. We need a when, a woman of color, an openly gay person, a non Christian, and so many more. He'll,we haven't even has a Catholic finish a term yet.   I don't think three sound ever be a racial or any other such requirement, but we so need to have more diverse leaders.
Honestly, I think Biden runs for one term and then endorses his VP, Kamala Harris.
We had Obama already though. Now it's time for us to elect a female president and/or a gay president.

>"While it's important to note that more than 516,000 Democratic primary ballots had been cast before the poll was fielded,   You're killing me. I hope they fix this for future primaries. So many people will have wasted their votes on a candidate who dropped out.  1.1 million votes were cast in the 2016 Dem primary. So could be nearly half voted before the Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Steyer withdrawals.
He needs to run it up in these strong pockets   Alabama, TN, VA, NC, GA  Hopefully Bernie gets blunted in California and we can hold our own in Texas   We need delegates and we need votes, there has to be a complete case in the event of a brokered convention
My wife and I voted early in NC for Joe. All the way, DJ!
Going to be a big day! Let's knock out Bernie by March 17th!
Time to drop out, Bloomberg.
Joe looks to be surging NATIONWIDE!
Wow
Oh baby! I just voted for him too! Let’s go Joe!
I know this is about NC, but looking at 538, if the margin could frankly be 31/21 in favor of Sanders, I'd consider that a major win. He won't dominate the delegates THAT much.
ITS HAPPENING
I did my part!
Go Joe!
Voted early for Biden here in Stanly County NC. Catching a ton of flack from BernieBros and TrumpTards.
Did my part by early voting for Joe weeks ago!
Awesome 👏
Now I wonder what kind of excuse Sanders is going to use when he loses the majority of votes.
Voted for Joe here in California. Hurts me to see so many people "bernie or bust." Every other state carry the load for us. Go Joe!
Joe is surging like crazy
Careful, manage your expectations. This is just one poll
too much people early voted :(
Bloomberg needs to drop out.
And I voted absentee from Europe for Joe!
Wasn't Joe narrowly trailing Bernie a in NC a few days ago?
Early voting allows people who can't get to the polls on the day to have a say and also prevents polling stations from being overwhelmed. Especially in states with high population density, it's great for democracy.
Brutal. There has to be a better balance for primaries.
This is totally why we all need ranked choice voting.
It's why we need ranked choice voting. Then when someone drops out people who chose them as their #1 can have their vote count for their #2.
Trying to be objective here, but if a candidate ends their campaign and endorses someone else, I almost feel like their early vote totals should fold into the endorsed candidate. I mean...that's what's going to happen to the delegates anyway right?  Same with Sanders if Warren were to drop out and endorse him (which I don't think is a lock she will).   It seems like the most sensible option than 500,000 wasted votes
It’s not a waste. They voted for who they wanted to vote for.
I filled out my WA ballot for Pete... My wife hadn't filled hers out yet so she's gonna go for Biden. I shoulda waited but I didn't think Pete would drop out being in 3rd.
I just don’t get why people early vote in the first place. Vote when it’s time that way you know who will be actually competing
“NC”  HE SURE DID
Your mistake was telling people who you’re gonna vote for publicly, that’s your info only! In reality among Dems you’re certainly in the majority
Yes.   The same pollster had Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg in a threeway tie around 10 days ago.  * https://i.imgur.com/pLgt6BI.png  Other polls:  * [FiveThirtyEight - North Carolina](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/north-carolina/)
Yes. One analysis I saw has said that in the past week (less really) there has been an average shift of +14 to Biden. We're now expected to win Texas, Virginia, and NC. And others, but those were expected to go to Sanders until recently.  EDIT: That may have been of ST states.
I'm not against early voting. I just think there should be a simple way to account for candidates dropping out. They did ranked choice for early voting in the Nevada caucus. This way if your top choice didn't hit 15% you automatically realign with your 2nd choice or third if need be.  Unless I'm misunderstanding something, I don't see why they wouldn't do something like that for all early voting.
People who vote for  candidates who dropped out should get a chance to revote.
We need ranked-choice voting. It promotes cooperation and puts a hamper on divisive extremism.
>It seems like the most sensible option than 500,000 wasted votes  Most of those 500,000 early votes would have been for Sanders, Biden, Warren or Bloomberg, so they're not all wasted. But there's definitely going to be sizable chunks that went to Pete or Amy and maybe 2 or 3 for Steyer.
While that may be fine with the 2nd (delegate) vote since you placed your trust in who you voted for, it's not really fair for the 1st vote.      Not *everyone* who voted for Pete would want Biden as their 2nd choice.       I do think Ranked voting is the future. Or at least the ability to re-cast your early vote (I know *some* states allow it).
>ly   >   >Give Award   >   >share   >   >Report  " Trying to be objective here, but if a candidate ends their campaign and endorses someone else, I almost feel like their early vote totals should fold into the endorsed candidate. I mean...that's what's going to happen to the delegates anyway right?"  jesus christ i wish. we wouldnt even have Trump in the White House if that was the case .
Warren won't endorse Sanders now that he called her a liar on a national debate stage.
you could get a replacement ballot if you want to if you haven't turned in your Pete ballot
Do people just vote for whoever they think will win?
If we're talking electoral reform I'd like to point out the person with the most votes currently is behind in the delegate count. Maybe that's also a good area to attack.
For primaries, I think standardizing how it works would be a good idea.  Break states in 5 sets of ten, maybe randomly assigned each cycle balanced by delegate count, have 5 primary days 3 weeks apart.  After each primary, one week downtime with a debate or two, then 2 weeks of voting.
A few states let you change your early vote on cases like this, but not very many.
Ranked-choice voting actually has a slight bias towards extremism. Not as bad as our system, granted, but it's still there none-the-less. Personally, I prefer approval or range voting  approval voting has a slight centrists preference, while range doesn't have any particular bias.
I mean wasn’t Pete polling close to 2nd/3rd in some states like Virginia and Texas?
You’re likely right but the whole process seems off.   Pure theoretical   If say Klobuchar got 12% of the vote in Utah and Biden for 14%, neither get delegates. Yet if her votes go to Biden then he has 26%  So different theoretical. Klobuchar got 18% and Biden 11%. Klobuchar earns delegates that are now almost sure to be pledged to Biden at the convention anyway.   That’s why I have a hard time seeing a difference of her vote totals going to the person she endorsed.
Not sure how those compute? Did a ton of GOP people who dropped out endorse a Trump opponent? I don’t think so but I honestly don’t remember
I mean at this point I think Warren could just as easily endorse Biden because he's actually you know...sane?   The more popular Bernie has become, the more unhinged he's sounded. Heck, I've seen his supporters recently encouraging him to use the same Fascist policies that they complain Trump employing since Trump set the precedent.
just did it online! super easy
good idea, I'll look into that
Bloomberg's support tanked in those polls. It also looks like Biden is picking up the undecideds. This doesn't include any Pete or Klobuchar supporters since they appear on both polls.   If you look at the poll that was added Feb. 25 vs the one that was added today:  * Biden 20% ➟ 45% * Sanders 20% ➟ 18% * Bloomberg 20% ➟ 11% * Warren 9% ➟ 7%
Generally, yes. It’s called something like the front runner effect. People like to vote for a winner, regardless of policy, etc.

Yeah as soon as they eliminate the Electoral college they can fix this system. Till then this accurately reflects how the election works, right?
All sound good. For primaries, you just want to cut down in wasted votes. I guess some states have a process to change your vote later? NC doesn't so not sure how that works.
what i meant is if votes were automatically being transferred from the candidate one casted them for to the candidate endorsed by that candidate, Hillary would have gained all votes from Bernie Sanders, whereas tons of Bernie supporters turned to Trump in 2016 or abstained from voting. given the fact Hillary still won the popular vote even in spite of that i'm fairly certain this would have assured her victory.
awesome!
Ok, that makes more sense.  Thank you
Bloomberg only had temporary high numbers because nobody knew anything about him.  &#x200B;  Anyone with time in NYC knew he was pretty awful.
bloomberg's support was primarily through ads, which are really good if you're the only one doing them. the effect is a lot less effective when there are other ads though. leading up to tuesday in ST i saw \*\*a lot\*\* of ads from amy, warren, biden, bernie, and in fact i saw biden's ad the most (like6 times in a hour) compared to bloomberg's 4
People want to think they were right
> Till then this accurately reflects how the election works, right?  No, in the general election it's winner take all in all but a couple of states. The current Democratic primary system is more democratic than that. I mean, except for superdelegates I guess.   > Yeah as soon as they eliminate the Electoral college they can fix this system.   I think, for the next primary, they should implement a ranked choice system across the board and declare the person with the most votes the winner at the end. Superdelegates should definitely not be a thing.
Warren Voter for Biden
> In order to implement any of Bernie's ambitious plans he will need to not only win against Trump, but win back the Senate.   It is *so* good to meet somebody who remembers that Congress is a thing!  And it's not just that.  Joe's proposals do not limit what Congress is allowed to do.  With a healthy Democratic majority, Congress can pass more bold measures.  Just because Joe didn't propose it doesn't mean he'll veto it!  A victory in November means democracy can start working again, with all members of the great coalition contributing, suggesting, debating, deciding, and making progress together!  Yes, including Warren and Sanders!
Totally agree with everything you say.  I was pretty sad to see Warren drop out.  If you haven't seen her bit on the SNL cold open, it is worthwhile.    I also think of my relative in swing states in the South that have slowly been driven out of the Republican party.  I think they could happily vote Biden, but not Sanders.  With a Sanders nomination they would probably find a third party or stay home.
I'm in pretty much the same boat. It was a difficult decision, and I respect Bernie for who he is and what he does, but we can only have one president, and that one person needs to get it all done. I have more faith in Bidens ability to get moderate progress done than Bernies ability to get radical change done.
Warren voter for Biden here, too. This echoes a lot of my thinking, although having experienced a toxic Sanders supporter face-to-face in 2016, I have been wary of that campaign for some time (I know some very nice ones, too, but...wow. It's hard to forget that kind of vitriol when it's aimed at your face from a couple feet away.) Also remember that, if Biden is elected, he'll actually be the most liberal president ever elected, by some measures.
I never have supported Bernie but I think he wants America to succeed.  I disagree with his way of doing some things.   The online support for him is confusing.   It is like his supporter forgot Civics class and lack an understanding of how government and political parties actually work.   You can't be cyber bullying Senators from a swing state because they don't agree on something that their constituents might be against.  90% of his supporters are fine but the 10% are naive, toxic homegrown or Russian influenced cyber bullies.
The interesting thing too is that Biden's plans are actually quite progressive. There are a couple that don't go as far as I'd like (mainly things having to do with higher ed) but it's pretty hard to read his plans and call him a moderate. I'm uncomfortable with how the Bernard brethren have co-opted the term "progressive" to exclude people who have a more incremental approach. If you never achieve anything, you're not making progress, so you're by (pedantic) definition not a progressive.
I have to completely agree about some of the Sanders supporters I see on here. They basically seem like the opposite side of the same coin as Trump supporters.
This. I too was a Warren supporter but as NJ resident our primary is one of the last on the calendar in June and any opportunity to vote for her is long gone.   Your comments about some of the online toxicity and purity tests by some of the Sanders supporters along with the "I'm taking my ball and going home" attitude if Bernie does not win is very off-putting. That along with the false equivalency that a vote for Joe is no different than a vote for Trump really turned me off from the Sanders campaign.
I think Bernie wants good things but is too ego driven to understand that he might not be the only one trying.   It's not the Twitter trolls I care about. It's the people who used to be close personal friends who are spewing hate at anyone who doesn't think Bernie is the second coming of Jesus.  They weren't always like this. They've been fed the rhetoric so long that it's become a way of life.
Great points. Former Pete voter (although Warren was definitely my #2) and I align closer to Bernie than I do Biden politically but I can't get behind Bernie's divisive tactics. His "everyone is wrong but me" and "I won't compromise on anything" is going to give us 4 more years of the same divisive political garbage Trump brought us and isn't going to move this country forward. Bernie has some great ideas and certainly has the ability to be unifying but he refuses to do it while letting his internet tribe do the dirty work of tearing down his opposition. Remaining silent on it doesn't give him impunity from it. Pete, Warren, Yang, Biden, etc would have never stood for that. Ever. And it's part of why I liked them.   It's so short sighted. You can't simultaneously mock and belittle people and treat them as stupid if they don't agree with you and then yell at them when they don't immediately align with you when their chosen candidate is gone. Turns out that bullying people into agreeing with you doesn't work. More importantly, we are above it.  I can't handle this "the end justifies the means" attitude and the justification that things are so serious right now that we have to be angry and spiteful. No. Just no. You can be angry... we all are. But there is no justification for this childishness and maliciousness, especially being aimed at good people who have done nothing wrong but disagree with how to reach the same goals. The way that Bernie supporters are treating Warren right now is abhorrent and it's a huge turnoff for me. She's done so much for this country and deserves so much better. I can't handle 4 more years of this division and name calling and I can't bring myself to support any campaign who will tolerate it.  I'm sort of proud of the Democratic Party and the candidates who see how this will end and are putting the past political differences aside to present a unified front. It has become clear to me in the last two weeks who the grownups in the room are. Biden has my vote.
Also a Warren to Biden guy. There is a very organic contigent of Bernie's base that are completely toxic. Like a month ago if you went to the comment section of Warren's Instagram it was chock full of snake emojis in every post she made. That cannot ALL be russian trolls. The other thing about is that I personally know a lot of Bernie brothers, and months ago they were calling Liz a fake progressive, a DNC plant and all kinds of other crazy malarkey. Bernie and his surrogates, whether or not they want to admit, have encouraged this incivility. David Sirota is one of the most toxic people you could imagine hiring to head up your press dept. You can't hire people like that, base your campaign on exclusivity, and expect to win.   While I veer a bit closer to Warren than Biden on some issues, Biden is a really good guy. He has faced so many challenges in his life, so much death of family, and he could have easily chosen to stop being a public servant for completely understandable reasons. But he continues to press on, he continues to be inclusive, continues to listen. He engages with his supporters very much like Warren does, he's personable and relatable.   I would love to see a Biden-Warren ticket. I think they'd make great allies and compliment each other's weaknesses very well.   In any event, Im happy to see that a majority of us Warren supporters understand all of this, and then Warren's inclusive vision best matches Biden's campaign.
I'm disappointed in a number of things that Bernie supporters have done.  I don't like how black and white their thinking is.  There is no room for gray area with them and that's just not how government works.  It's incredibly divisive and it's not going to heal the division that we already have.  I'm very progressive, but I also understand that this isn't just MY America.  I'm not always going to get everything that I want, and I do have several areas where I am willing to compromise.  I don't know that some of them do.    Some of his supporters also have this incredible superiority complex and they think that they have the moral high ground because of who they support politically.  As if supporting Bernie Sanders is the only way to care about people.
>They have voted for Democrats in the past, but have stated that they think Sanders is "too liberal".   A common socialist saying comes to mind: "liberals get the bullet too". Billionaires might be first on Bernie's list of people to liquidate, but his people have open hostility toward the Obamas and Bidens of the world because of a genuine ideological rift.
Welcome!
Are you me?  I am quite progressive but I cannot stand to have people assume that means that Sanders is my second choice after Warren dropped out.  For all the reasons you state I can't support him.  Beyond that though the people on the right who maybe internally feel like their party left them behind might look at Biden as an escape ramp from the gop, while they would never look twice at sanders.  It's going to take a lot to heal the divide in this country and I don't think any one politician can do it alone but I know that Biden can build the coalition to make an attempt at it.  I doubt Sanders would even try.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎
I totally agree! Well said.  Warren was my second choice, after Pete, and while I hate to see them both gone from the race, I've come to agree that Biden is our best bet for restoring sanity to D.C. I do hope he takes slightly more progressive stances on a few things with input from Pete, Amy, and Warren, but there's definitely a balance to be struck if anything is to actually to be accomplished.
you summed up my feelings almost exactly. and i was a Bernie supporter back in 2016.
You hit the nail on the head OP. And I especially agree with Bernie supporters resembling Trump supporters. Now they’ve started with a smear campaign on Joe’s mental ability. It’s gross. And laughable considering Bernie is older, just had a heart attack, clearly in worse physical shape than Biden and could be developing dementia himself as we speak.   I’ve about had it with Bern Bros. They remind me of starry eyed cultists. They lack any realism about the current political climate and how Bernie has 0 chance to get through any of his policies. Especially since he doesn’t know how to play well with others and is not well liked. After what they did to Warren and her followers, they tuned me off for good.
Pete for Joe here (already caucused in Nevada).  Those are almost the exact reasons I went over to Joe instead of Bernie when Pete dropped out.   Liz would have made a fantastic President. She's done a lot for this country, and how she has been treated in this campaign is shameful. I hope we see her in a very prominent part of a Biden administration, including VP.
Liz was my first choice after Pete dropped out, who was my first choice after Yang dropped out, who was my first choice after Cory dropped out. Now I'm left with Joe, the only option.   I value critical thinking skills over ideology. I didn't agree with Warren on everything, but I respected her thought process and due diligence in forming her opinions and policy. She is  goal-oriented, as she wants to get things done to help people. Bernie doesn't have those skills. He seems to follow whatever the banal new-age, anti-capitalist stance is for the sake of ideological purity, especially on science issues, whether they're right or wrong. I could not picture Warren letting Marianne Williamson serve as her surrogate to talk about health issues.
another Warren voter here who agrees with you! I don't dislike Bernie, and he has some great hopes and ideas, but darn it, sometimes he seems almost as self-centered as an orange person we all know of. 0\_0  A friend put it well, I thought: the house is on fire. We have to put it out before we start to argue about how to remodel the kitchen or which new window treatments we want.  Was it Joe who said we need restoration first, then revolution?
Welcome and thank you for that perspective! Let’s get Trump out and work together.
I voted for Warren, too. I think Sanders is a really decent guy with many wonderful supporters. But I've had some bad experiences with folks from the "progressive" movement (including Sanders supporters). I also have a lot of reservations about the Sanders camp, in particular: the disinterest in coalition building, its open (edit: occasional) sympathy for illiberal regimes abroad, etc. I just can't get behind them in this primary.  With Warren out of the race, I'm in for Biden. I've got my disagreements with Biden, too, but I think his campaign is the best remaining vehicle for *persuading* Americans further to the left.
Same. Im disappointed that Biden will be the nominee, but Sanders supporters being excited to harass people online but not excited to actually go vote has soured me on Sanders, as well as his Joe Rogan ad. Regardless, I already voted on Super Tuesday, so I'm just waiting for the general election shit show. In the meantime, I want to work with anyone on the Left to actually get shit done.
Thank you for your support,and welcome!let's take back the white house together!  Warren ran a great campaign. She want my first pick but I would have no qualms allot voting for her in the general of she was nominated. And it really is a damn shame that ultimately what sank her campaign was that she was first about M4A,both the cost and the complexity of implementation.
You are 100% correct.  I like Bernie and have no problem with him, but we have to make the smart choice here.  I have every confidence that Biden will beat Trump.
Another Warren voter for Biden here, and this summarizes a lot of my thoughts too.  The things I would add are:  1. I worry about what all the purity tests will mean for actually staffing a Sanders administration. If only true believers are welcome, that really limits the talent pool. I hate the Trump admin for its policies, but also for the way that it values loyalty over qualifications and experience in political appointees.  We may not have kids in cages, but we’ll still be deeply fucked if we end up with Joe Rogan as Secretary of State.  2. I think Bernie is playing with fire by whipping people into a populist frenzy.  As we’ve seen with all the online harassment, he either lacks the willingness or the ability to control his supporters.  What is going to happen if he gets elected and can’t get his bills through Congress?  A subset of his followers are convinced that enacting his policies are matters of life and death, and that anyone who stands in Bernie’s way is an enemy and a traitor.  If that’s the lens through which people are viewing things, all manner of tactics become justifiable, including violence.  I’m as frightened of the virulent Bernie supporters as I am of the virulent Trump supporters.  I think it’s naive to think you can wield that sort of rhetoric and contain the negative consequences.
I have to completely disagree with number 3. I think the vast majority of the Dem to Dem toxicity online is manufactured. I doubt most of the really mean ones are voting age Americans.   Mostly though, I agree. I wanted Biden as the POTUS to follow Obama's second term, and I still want him to be our next president. If Bernie happens to upset us, we need to try to get our independent/left leaning friends on-board.   In the more likely scenario, we need to get the younger people excited about Joe. Clinton lost the key states, because people who would have voted for her over Trump but didn't feel strongly enough, didn't vote. Bernie's "coalition of the young" isn't reliable enough to win the whole thing, but some part of it is necessary. Voter apathy will kill us. Hopefully Biden comes up with something that Bernie can, convincingly, get behind. We need a high turnout to win this thing.
As a fellow Warren supporter I have to agree with these points. At the end of the day it's about winning and actually making progress.
Welcome and thank you for joining us!

I am skeptical about the expectation that youth vote won’t show up tomorrow.   With the coronavirus being more dangerous to older folks and Biden showing heavy lead in polls, there is more than 50/50 change that Bernie carries Michigan tomorrow similar to 2016 when Hillary had 20 point lead  I hope that’s not the case, but can’t be sure. Hate amd anger drives voter turnout and Bernie supporters have already said they are in war now.
Biden supporter, but I'm very confused because of this video:   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuZSOf8XlvU&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuZSOf8XlvU&feature=youtu.be)   ??? is that video true?

Sanders supporter here...also 26M who has inner depedencies on conspiracy theories, to video games, and serious distrust of the government. I voted on tuesday and have outgrown a lot of social and political immaturity. But it’s younger men cities who are glued to their computers drowning out their woes who are a big percentage not showing up.  Edit: generally, but also specifically, to us white middle class young men who can afford to ignore it all.
Lets be real.   Biden supporters were in no way going to vote for Bernie if he had won the nomination.  So there's no way Biden supporters should expect Bernie supporters to vote for Biden.  Is that clear?
[removed]
I agree.  And I think Biden's long experience in Congress will really help with that.  He's worked with these people for a long time and built up a lot of trust.
I had an argument with someone once because they claimed it didn't matter if Bernie lost the House and Senate, he could just do his entire agenda through executive orders. What a solid plan...
I was going through Biden's website to see his proposals, and I was pretty pleased by the fact that his proposals are already active bills in Congress. Meanwhile, Bernie really thinks he can just strong arm his way through the presidency. While Bernie is still not completely out, his lackluster performance isn't going to bode well in office either.
My parents liked Warren, they leaned Biden, my mother said she'd vote Trump over Sanders, my dad said he may just leave the president box blank. They're lifelong moderate democrats.
I was very sad to see Warren drop out, although I saw the writing on the wall for awhile.  I did see her in the cold open, and it was great!  The little back stage dance was fun too!  Although, judging from the Twitter comments on the video, apparently she's not allowed to have any fun unless she's endorsing Bernie.
Yes.  I'd rather take some moving the needle forward on issues I care about vs. nothing (or worse, moving backward) if Trump wins again.
When I was a hyper-aggressive Bernie stan in 2016 I had no clue about civics. I stopped supporting him when I learned how the government works and how unrealistic his ideas are. He's appealing to people on an emotional level and hoping to bypass the logistic issues.
I'm arguing with a guy right now who is claiming Obama wasn't a progressive. It's fucking infuriating. Bernie's rhetoric has poisoned public discourse just as much as Trump's has.  He also thinks Bernie can get his entire agenda achieved through executive orders.
I've noticed that too. I used to consider myself a progressive but if that's what it takes then I guess maybe I'm not. *shrug*
There's actually very few differences, policy-wise, between Biden and Bernie. The big ones are m4a all and student loan forgiveness, but both candidates are going in the same direction. It's not like Bernie wants medicare for all and biden wants medicare for no one, but bernie's people act like he does. I keep having people tell me they can't survive the status quo, and I'm like, so vote for biden? *sigh*
horseshoe theory.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory
Yeah it’s sad to see. I was for Bernie, but I know especially with the polls that Biden will win. And honestly not even mad it could even be better. Biden can get stuff passed. Reduced college, $15 min wage, and common sense for foreign  policy will work for me!
Yeah. I've seen those charts bandied about comparing all the candidates and Trump and it's very misleading. It's like if you're not 100% for them then you might as well be a Republican. Which is Trump's way of thinking.
I was a Bernie supporter in 2016 because Warren decided not to run, but I voted for Clinton in the general (of course). I even liked Hillary in the beginning when she announced. But, like, I remember thinking/saying some pretty negative things about her! It's kind of amazing how the toxicity got to me, and I didn't realize it until dealing with it as a Warren supporter. Even generally kind, decent people can get sucked into a negative echo chamber, sadly. I just wish people from the Sanders campaign tried to stop it back in 2016. At this point, it's much more of an uphill battle.
Yeah I respect Bernie for sticking to his principles for this long and I even voted for him in the primary in 2016. But something has changed between then and now, and my vote feels more consequential now than before (we were all expecting Trump to lose).
Here here! I keep seeing Bernie supporters say that he can't control what his supporters online say but I think he has more control than he thinks. I respected the hell out of Pete's "Rules of the Road". That kind of direction has to come from the top. And if you make it clear that that kind of crap will get you banned from online groups of your supporters then it won't happen nearly as much. When Warren was faltering and after she dropped out the subreddit was flooded with desperate Bernie supporters trying to poach voters. We even put a stickie up to tell them that wouldn't be tolerated but it still happened. Meanwhile a Biden rep came in the sub and said that if any Biden supporter tried the same, to send a screenshot and the person would be banned. That's how you control that stuff. Yes, we are all angry and want things to change. Yes, some people are desperate. But being an asshole to people who you want to support your candidate is not how you convince them.
I work in the Chicago area and I'd say 80% of my coworkers are solid lifelong democrats. A couple are pro Bernie and very kind and reasonable. The rest think that his entire campaign radiates toxicity and would rather vote for anyone else.
Yeah I saw that. And yet now they are demanding our support. If we are fake progressives for supporting Warren, who want to take healthcare away from children, then why do you want our support so badly? Bernie is not entitled to our votes on policy alone. The best policy means nothing if you get Trump re-elected.   I'd love a Biden-Warren ticket too but I'm not sure it would happen.
Yes. The whole "you care about mean people online while children are dying for lack of healthcare" thing really angers me. I mean, can't I care about both? The best policy means nothing if Trump wins.
Yeah. And I have a problem with that. You can agree to disagree on policy but as soon as we start demonizing our own we lose to Trump.
Absolutely. There was a comment going around Twitter after Super Tuesday about how we were all traumatized to a greater or lesser extent by Trump and that as a country we need healing. One of the replies stated that after Nixon it was a relief having steady, ordinary Ford in office. That's what I was thinking about in my comment.
Yeah I've seen that.  If Biden's doctors don't have any issues with him potentially being President then I don't see an issue either.  Although maybe a 2nd term isn't in the cards, but that will depend.
Pete for Joe here too.  When Pete dropped out two days before our Virginia primary, I spent that night going back and forth weighing the pros and cons of giving my vote to Biden, Warren, or Klobuchar (after the "racist," "cheater," and "corporate rat" smears on Pete, Bernie was not even up for consideration).  Once I saw that both Buttigieg and Klobuchar were endorsing Biden, I knew what was happening, and the decision was easy.  It boggles my mind that Bernie supporters are treating her this way when she's the most powerful potential ally Bernie has.  If they hadn't attacked her so relentlessly, she probably already would have endorsed Bernie by now.  It doesn't surprise me at all that she needs some more time to think about it.  All the same, I think Warren is exceptionally smart, and I hope Biden gives her a Cabinet position.  She'd be stellar as Secretary of the Treasury.
The thing is every Warren, Pete, Joe, Harris, Beto, Booker supporter I have ever met had nothing but warm feelings for all other candidates. My Sanders supporter IRL friends hated everyone but Warren. Online, it was all respect across the board but Sanders supporters hating everyone else.  Like, I had a guy who put a giant PETE 2020 sign in his office who would gush about Warren and Booker! It was great camaraderie.
I agree. She's got this Lisa Simpson hyper prepared vibe going on and as a nerdy woman I love it. It would be very cool if she became VP but it wouldn't convince the most ardent progressives, because they already feel she betrayed them.
Yes! Let's get some shit done!
It's telling that the only example of a politically motivated act of terror from the left in the last 20-30 years was from a Bernie supporter. The guy that shot Steve Scalise.
I agree, especially with #2. Not all Bernie supporters are this way (I personally know several who will discuss policy disagreements without being assholes and who are still "vote blue no matter who"), but there's a subset that just seems bonkers to me in much the same way as certain Trump supporters.
Some of the toxicity is trolling, yes. In the Warren sub there was a guy sending PMs making nasty statements and asking us to support Biden, but his comment history clearly showed he was a Trumper. But there is a chunk of it that doesn't come from trolls. Lots of people have had issues with Bernie supporter friends or acquaintances in person, for example.   I agree about your other statement, though. We need to get some of the young vote to turn out. Maybe a young VP pick or prominent staff would help. I don't know what the answer is exactly but we can't be complacent like we were in 2016.

We will see. The polling I've seen for Michigan is pretty favorable for Biden. Other Western states are tighter though. You're right that things could change.  As for war, this really shouldn't be a war, IMO. That's part of the problem I have with his supporters. Vote for who you want to vote for but scorched earth just divides us.
Sanders supporters and Trump are trying to paint him as in mental decline.  He's had a stutter his whole life and I think that's some of it.  He's also well known for gaffes.  His doctor said everything is ok.
Independent voters voting in a Democratic primary aren't necessarily the same thing as independent voters voting in the general election.
I'm already aware of how Warren went after Biden on the bankruptcy bill, thanks.
I mean, why support a candidate so strongly online and then not show up to vote for him when it really matters?
I, for one, was always "vote blue no matter who". All the Bernie supporter friends I've talked to in person are the same. That doesn't mean they all are, but I like to think our #1 issue here should be beating Trump, whether that's with Bernie or Biden on the ticket.
Saving this for November.
This comment embodies so many of the rains OP gave for not joining the Sanders campaign. Sanders supporters are a small fraction of the democratic party. You don't have the right to dictate to everyone else that a must kneel and obey you and your dear leader.
With all due respect, I look forward to seeing you proven wrong.  Also, I'm sorry, *Tulsi is a Progressive?*
I mean you're welcome to your opinion, but the polls and the low youth turnout say otherwise. *shrug*  Facts matter.
Blaine Gabbert?
fucking Gabbard L O L  You don't give a shit about policy, you're just a contrarian. If the mainstream media was in Sanders pocket you'd find another contrarian to worship.
Ah yes, the "I Can Do Anything I Want" theory from the Donald Trump School of Constitutional Law.
Yeah god forbid a woman candidate has a chill moment. She deserves a few laughs, dammit!!
Warren thinks in systems and institutions and therefore her theory of change is very far from Bernie - they're ideological allies but philosophically world's apart.  Also Warren understands how politics works - through collaboration and partnership.  I'm also Warren to, begrudgingly, Biden. I'm hell bent on getting democrats back in power, without it, ideas have no value.  I don't respect Biden much for his voting record, but from my real world experience I'd go for a facilitator/listener with good EQ, basic human to human decency, and a collaborative and positive spirit over a toxic and divisive visionary any day of the week.
Oh she the dog
I really like "Medicare for all" or whatever someone wants to label it. One health care system, that covers everyone is the most efficient. I think Biden knows it can't be accomplished permanently in one presidential term. He wants to forward the march, so that it feels inevitable in a decade or so. I like Bernie and Warren, I just worry that too many people will be turned off of whoever the Democratic candidate is, because of their attacks on each other. Like they say "Democrats need to fall in love; Republicans fall in line."
>I'm arguing with a guy right now who is claiming Obama wasn't a progressive.  If they admitted that Obama was progressive, then they might notice that Biden has moved to the left since 2008, and then they couldn't claim their guy is the only progressive.
Progressives don't want us apparently.  We're Warren Democrats :)
Oh totally, it's something that has been really frustrating for me. Like if you disagree with the pathway to the same end goal it's like "WHY DO YOU HATE POOR PEOPLE" or "WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME TO HAVE HEALTH CARE" like this very clearly comes from a lack of understanding about the opponents' positions. They don't realize that they're telling on themselves like this.   And yeah like the idea of obliterating private health insurance - I fundamentally disagree with that to a degree that is completely deal killing, but that's really the only thing. With everything else I'm on the same page with the end goal. I just want people to tell me convincingly how we're going to get there because I'm not trying to vote for a snake oil salesman.
I have to say there seems to be a lot of evidence supporting this theory as of late. I’ve seen so many talking points being pushed by Bernie supporters that are just downright lies and meaningless quotes without context that seem straight out of the Donald.
I think ultimately for me that’s the main deciding factor as well (him being able to get things passed). Bernie is going to get a lot of grief from parts of the Democratic Party as well as the entire Republican Party united against what they consider socialism. Biden will move with the majority of the Democratic Party and could easily get moderate Republicans on his side too. This whole notion that Sanders would start this revolution and all his supporters would be calling their representatives and senators to pressure them to support his legislation is nothing more than a fantasy when he can’t even rely on them to consistently go out and vote for him.
I'd love her at Treasury!
And now they even hate Warren :-(
Really good point.
Completely agree.   I, also, worded my disagreement poorly. I wasn't talking about the regular jackasses. I meant the death threats, misogyny, and slurs. The headline grabbers are the ones I meant.
Well you can see the anger right here on this post, pretty sure the complainer is gonna sitout Biden vs Trump and may be even go vote for Trump thus verifying the horseshoe theory
Sorry I think my original comment got deleted because I posted a link from a different site- I’m on the fence and was wondering what your take on this criticism from her is, basically
I mean I voted and I do vote.
EXACTLY  I pointed out that treating the legislature as if it's optional is exactly what Trump has been criticized for and it's just an awful precedent to set. I got downvoted, go figure. Thanks /r/Politics!
Probably learned it at Trump University.
Edward Luce on Twitter: In his first sentence Biden says something Trump hasn't yet uttered: "First of all my heart goes out to all those suffering from the coronavirus.."
Biden has a genuine human sense of empathy that's so rare in politics.
Before all my first choice candidates suspended I was shouting this. Biden’s townhalls on CNN showed his compassion. He has a lovely heart and soul. I believe Bernie does too but Biden has my vote.
Honestly it’s the first time I heard anyone acknowledge those who have already died.
Great opening to that question by Joe. Very good start to the debate.
Trump doesn’t have a heart to give out.
Luce is Financial Times North American leader
to the world: VOTE JOE BIDEN  to joe biden: ADOPT MEDICARE FOR ALL
Yea he is the only one like that tbh.

Charlotte Alter on Twitter: Anecdotally-- I'm hearing from Warren voters saying they now plan to vote for Biden, and that the mistreatment from the Bernie base is a big part of that calculation. They use words like "rude" and "negative" to describe the vibes coming from Bernie camp.
While we're on this subject:  **We will not tolerate what they're doing**. If you see one of our users treating Warren supporters this way, please message the mods.
I hate, *hate*, the standard BB response to this.  "Someone was mean to me on the internet, so I want people to not have healthcare."  Or something to that effect.  It shows me they've learned *nothing* from 2016 or from this.  The messaging and the messenger is just as, if not more, important than the message.  This is why Pete did so well with his future former republicans.  He could talk to them like they weren't the enemy and put forward progressive ideas in a way that didn't send them running for the hills.  I don't know if any of you guys saw the Democratic Socialists of America post where they did a dance mocking pete's exit from the race, but after I saw that I wasn't worried about them anymore.  They might have been able to build a movement, but they'll never put together the broad support they need to actually accomplish anything.   Not unless they stop treating the people that mostly agree with them as if they're the enemy.
The Bernie bros have been downright bullying and abusive across the spectrum.  Of course it's going to turn people off.  Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if Warren stuck around through the 17th just because of this.
Same. They were such assholes on r/politics I stopped going there after checking it religiously since 2016.    Of course it's not all of them. But most of them for sure.    Nasty trolls. Wishing harm on people. Threatening to vote for Trump if Bernie had the nomination "stolen again".    I get the the frustration and the anger  I get the mistrust... But they don't get that they are easily suggestible. They get furious if you try to point out that they might have bought into a conspiracy theory, dunning-kreuger etc...    It's raw unfocused populism. And it's dangerous. It's rooted in good intentions... Governmental corruption is bad ... Wealth inequality is bad ... Etc.  But the laser-like focus is fucking intense but it's off the mark.
Summary of tweet replies --  Warren backers (most of them women): "this absolutely describes me, I'll be switching to Biden after the abuse I've had to deal with like people telling me I'm only voting with my vagina"  Bernie backers: "WELL THEYRE DUMB USELESS FUCKS ANYWAY AND THEY HATE POOR PEOPLE AND WANT PEOPLE TO DIE I HOPE THEY ROT"  Quod Erat Demonstrandum.
The problem with Bernie's supporters is that they view *everything* in purely moral terms. There is no room for negotiation when "medicare for all" isn't a disagreement about whether or not such a program could be adequately funded but whether or not you believe *people deserve to die.* Because Sanders only *speaks* in moral terms, his supporters only *think* in moral terms. When you try to describe why hypothetically doubling the federal budget at the same time we nationalize 25% of the economy may in fact create some problems all they hear is blasphemy against their moral god.
The North remembers.
I think people can only take so much "woe is me! the establishment is against me! establishment figures like beto, who only showed up two years ago, and mayor pete who has never held federal office, are all aGaInSt mE!!!!" It's like bro, you've been in congress for 30 years.
Yup. I am a Warren supporter and I'd say I'm Joe-curious. Not only is Bernie's base vicious and rude, but I don't believe he'd actually accomplish anything if he was elected; his history in congress demonstrates that he can't build a coalition. I believe in progressive ideas, which is why I don't want them to fail under Bernie and then be tainted forever. But of course, I get accused of being a fake progressive...
In the words of John Legend: “Some of you Bernie supporters do quite the disservice to your candidate, who seems to be a great human being. Try not to drive people away with your nastiness"
How about the Pete voters who went instantly for Biden the second Pete said to, never mind that Pete was way more progressive than Biden, because “cruel” “abusive” and “homophobic” describes the vibes there
Priors? CONFIRMED Succs? BTFO’d Malarkey? GET OUTTA HERE JACK
A lot of the sentiment ive seen in the bernie camp is “we’re so goddamn righteous, don’t you dare criticize us. Oh, and if you see certain policies differently then theres NOOO way you’ve had any experiences similar to ours.”   Not all bernie ppl, I used to be a bernie guy, but sheesh. Its there. Undeniable. Especially when the man himself doesn’t quell it. He loves being the victim.
I am a Warren supporter who would vote for Biden if it were between him and Sanders. I have already voted.  There are a lot more reasons. And I am sure there are other Warren supporters who don’t appreciate the constant implication that Sanders and Warren are the same. I always resented that, and felt that it was because our society tends to view women and candidates who aren’t white as more left leaning than they actually present themselves.   Their polices are meaningfully different. Just because you support Warren’s policies, does not mean you will choose Sanders’ policies over Biden’s. For example, I didn’t want Warren to endorse M4A and think she was pressured to support it. I am more comfortable with the public option and eventually transforming the ACA to universal coverage.   Their priorities were meaningfully different. Warren prioritizes good government reform and family leave, while Sanders is more concerned with scraping the ACA for a new Canadian-style health care system.   I don’t like Sanders’ “me against everyone else” attitude. I don’t like empty anti-elite rhetoric. I don’t like vilifying allies. I don’t like the rejection of the party, of the political process, or compromise.   I don’t think America is a hell scape. I think it is a place that is deeply flawed and needs structural reform.   I think many Warren supporters will become Biden supporters if Warren leaves the race, and it isn’t just because Sanders’ toxic supporters were mean.   Many Warren supporters are a core part of the traditional base of the Democratic Party—older highly educated liberal Democrats, especially women. Why would they automatically flock to an independent who’s schtick is being light on details.
Definitely, it started with the Bernie Bros going after and harassing organizations that endorsed other candidates, in particular telling an African American person they were “still on the plantation” and also sending death threats. Even in a Discord I’m on, I used to participate in our politics discussions until Bernie fans made me feel uncomfortable and like I’m some horrible person for not voting for their candidate. They are social media trolls and bullies, and they’ve been downright abusive to Elizabeth Warren and her supporters.
I also love the memes showing all the "centrist" "establishment" Democrats who lost. As if someone who has much lower support among most democratic voters would do better?
You know. I’d really like to hear what some of the candidates (current and former) have to say about the online abuse some of us have had at the hands of the BBs
Bernie also has less support from women in general, and a lot of Warren's supporters are women. While almost all of Bloomberg's support will go to Biden, Warren's support will be somewhat split between Biden and Sanders.
Voter turnout for Bernie supporters was down for super Tuesday.  How the hell do they expect to win if they don't vote?
I might be in this camp as well. As a young person I should be Bernies target demographic but I’ve been through so much abuse from Bernie bro’s, not just online but irl as well. And Bernie does nothing to stop it. He keeps doubling down saying there is no need for him to ever compromise or expand his base. Then all this conspiracy theory bs about the “establishment” screwing him when it’s just fewer people voted for you! Every day I can convos with people telling me how “Bernie would have won in 2016 without the superdelegates” and they don’t believe me when I show them Hillary got 3 million more votes. Then they were so vicious to Warren whenever they didn’t meet their high purity standards, their vitriol against her now is insane. I hope she doesn’t endorse Bernie. Let’s go, Joe! A kind, compassionate, experienced politician.
"lol nobody decides who theyr'e voting for based on internet comments" -Bernie's Base and staffers who've been spreading shit the whole time
So I’ve been a Sanders supporter since 2016 (although I was pretty Warren-curious back when she was polling really high last year). I still like a lot of his ideas but I’m seeing the writing on the wall. I’m fine with Biden and I’ll happily vote for him in November.   Anyways, this animosity from “BBs” towards Warren drives me nuts and has for a long time. It’s been such an obstacle because I like Bernie himself but so many supporters, especially online, are just closed-minded and vicious.   All I have to do is say “Hey guys, maybe Warren isn’t a conspiring snake. Maybe she just wants to be President because she thinks she’s be good at it” and I get downvoted to oblivion and my inbox blows up.  What was really fun was trying to explain to them during the Super Tuesday results yesterday that even if Bernie has the plurality at the convention, that would mean more than half the party didn’t pick him. And that group is entitled to pick whatever “not Bernie” they want—and that it’s not a conspiracy, it’s just politics.
you love to see it.
I’m seeing Warren folks on social media upset with Bernie Bros and don’t know what to do going forward....
This is such an excellent example of why Bernie will never expand his base or win the nomination. In response to feedback that toxicity in the campaign is off putting to potential supporters: toxic personal attacks.
You know it would be real funny if after Warren talks with Bernie, she then announces she's dropping out...   .....to endorse Biden.   I am sure Warren feels the same way about the attacks on her and her supporters from the Bernie camp. Hell, even prominent Bernie surrogate Ilhan Omar blamed Warren for Bernie's poor perfomance wtf.   Are they feeling the Bern so much, that they are all Berning every other bridge even with their own "progressive" allies like Warren?
Who is the ideal VP pick for Warren supporters?
Bernie Bros Vibe Check: Bernie Bros not vibin’
Meh they don't actually vote so who cares.   But seriously, you are 100% correct.
Okay, yeah, there's got to be some kind of internal memo or something because they all run the same gambit. Have you gotten the shit where you cite the fact that you don't like how the supporters of the campaign have been and then they ask for proof as a deflection, and if you give it to them they give some kind of shitty justification?  🙋‍♂️  Signed, a Warren voter in Virginia who's ready to volunteer for Joe. Who's got an endless shit for supporting her from only one candidate's supporters, who have suddenly either turned around and said that we need to unite, or triple down and said vile things, It's been a fun few months.
>I don't know if any of you guys saw the Democratic Socialists of America post where they did a dance mocking pete's exit from the race, but after I saw that I wasn't worried about them anymore  These Bernie Bots have been demonizing Mayor Pete, Amy, Beto but expect their supporters to magically transform to Bernie Sanders (who himself has endorsed many hateful and divisive people like Ilhan Omar and Linda Sarsour).
I can say there's a lot of orphaned former Republicans from 2016 down here in the Southern states' suburbs, me included. Southern suburbs are a big part of the reason GA and TX will eventually go blue in the coming years, and people like Biden and Pete are an easy transition into the party and really expand the electorate, especially with those of us who just want the country to be normal again. Meanwhile you've got a guy who's acting like Obama and Biden are career Republican sellout fascists and is as divisive as the person who caused us to leave the Republican party. Dems have dodged a huge bullet here by slowing (and likely stopping) him from the nomination.
[This is a great response from wonkette.com](https://www.wonkette.com/well-call-it-grander-for-sanders) A quote: “Because for all you sneer that "oh mean words matter more than people dying from lack of healthcare?" well, what matters more to you: Getting to say mean words, or people dying from lack of healthcare?”
Don't forget the more important reason that is a garbage argument, Joe supports public option and has an extremely strong plan for health care. It's a strawman through and through.
And both Biden and Amy went out of their way to say Republicans aren't enemies and we all need to work together and Sanders supporter relentlessly criticized them for it.  But that's how you win over Republicans, Independents, Democrats and suburban women who value decency over revolution.
Exactly.  Andrew Yang put out a tweet that was minimally positive about Bloomberg (the same thing he does after every single candidate drops out) and people were treating him as if he just sacrificed his first born child.  There were so many replies calling him a traitor, sell out, fake progressive, etc.   If you are ganging up on YANG for crying out loud, one of the sweetest and kindest politicians with a broad albeit small coalition, then you are asking to lose every election. I just can't grasp how they think this is supposed to work. Do they think they can just guilt trip and bully everybody into submission? Ridiculous.
>  The messaging and the messenger is just as, if not more, important than the message.  It's funny because they used to say this about Hillary, they have no idea that their idol and they are worse than she was.
>I hate, *hate,* the standard BB response to this.  "Someone was mean to me on the internet, so I want people to not have healthcare."  Or something to that effect.  imagine being this totally inept at basic human interaction and not understanding the social nature of our species and being genuinely pikachu-shocked that treating people like shit today means they don't like you tomorrow
If she said this in a public forum I'd write her a check instantly.
I’m leaving my weekly contribution to Warren’s campaign active for as long as she wants it. Added another for Biden today, too.
That sub is just a big Bernie circlejerk.
It's better to engage with a smaller community.
You forgot that they were always really a trump supporter anyways.
With all the coronavirus around, it’s extremely ill-advised to literally vote with one’s vagina. Impressive, but ill-advised.
I started with Warren and then she mis-pivoted. Then switched to Pete because I like his podcasting and saw he was over performing. Now I am going to Joe. I said he was the most likely to win over a year ago and it turns out I was right. This race has been messy and complicated and crazy.  Cubs should not have won the World Series.
Yes!!! This analysis is spot-on.   Slightly different, but earlier today, I commented to my Bernie-supporter friend that despite being progressive, I’m not a huge fan of AOC. I tried to explain that she initially had broad appeal and lost it by lobbing insults at other people and being inflammatory—for example, my non-Democrat mother has told me that she initially respected/liked AOC for her grass-roots movement and progressivism, but now dislikes her because of her rhetoric and such. When I was explaining to my usually-reasonable friend that this sort of behavior makes people not like AOC, they responded rather scathingly, “What, you don’t like her because she has values?”  I think a lot of well-meaning Bernie supporters use their (perceived) moral superiority as an excuse to be dismissive. They think that they and their candidates are morally “in the right”, so whenever someone doesn’t want to vote for those candidates, they just dismiss that person as being morally “in the wrong”. It’s a dangerous and divisive way of thinking.
It’s ironic how this purely moral thinking is immoral in itself.
Not to mention cancelling all student loan debt, making 4 year colleges free for everyone, AND transitioning away from an oil-based economy.    How the actual heck did these people believe USA became a superpower?  We discovered oil and used it to enhance American manufacturing.  If we're to transition away from that type of economy and actually fight climate change, we can't do it while also doubling our national budget.  And we certainly can't do it while remaining a superpower with the grandiose ideas Sanders has.
There’s a psychological term for this—[moralization](http://exploringyourmind.com/moralization-type-violence/amp/) .
They confuse goals with policies. To them, their policies are the goal.  You can say you don't support single payer, and they'll respond asking why you are against universal healthcare (when you aren't)
You are not alone, and I completely agree. Warren supporter. I’m glad I got to vote for her. My biggest pet peeve in this race has been the assumption that Warren supporters should naturally flow to Sanders. I have already written volumes on this. He is an independent who is light on details. That is so far from the idea of what Warren represented for me.   I think Biden’s campaign hasn’t been run well because people don’t really know well yet what he stands for, but his current policy proposals are more progressive than what Hillary Clinton was proposing in 2016. And her platform was more progressive than Obama’s. I hope Biden gets his message out better now that there are fewer candidates. His website is worth checking out. It is isn’t as good as Warren’s obviously, but her website is essentially a blueprint for the progressive movement moving forward.
I'm in the same boat. To see Sanders blame his supporters' behavior entirely on Russian bots in a debate turned me off from him, along with all the other things you've stated. While I'm sticking with Warren until she drops, if she drops before I vote I'm voting for Biden over Sanders 100%.
Warren is at least a progressive. Bernie isn't even that. He's a socialist. Progressives want everyone to be able to get medical care, and the assumption among everyone is that the rich and poor will have access to the same hospitals.  Once capitalism is abolished, that is no longer a given. In Cuba, a country Bernie considers a model of his ideology, rich and poor have to go to [different facilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNhgym2bMtA).
I’ve always seen Warren’s supporters as the traditional progressive voting bloc of the DNC. A chunk of the Bernie crowd is a new breed of progressive voters that don’t fit in the party well, in a traditional sense, which is why they don’t really care about party unity.
I think that is spot on. Is “technocratic progressive” a term? Incremental change — even if rapid incremental change — is almost always better than a complete start from scratch.
but why should that affect your choice in nominee? Shouldn't you make that decision based on the way the candidate himself behaves and his positions?
I remember seeing “Pete the rat” posts spread like wildfire after Iowa. And a conspiracy that he somehow had a hand in the app glitching that night, that I haven’t heard since Bernie had won the other primaries pre Super Tuesday.  I like Bernie. But I don’t like people being asses. I hate this idea that it’s basically like Bernie has all the right answers and any other candidate is basically a different shade of Trump when that is just not the case.
I can only speak for myself. Corey Booker or Stacey Abrams. Biden needs a charismatic, pragmatic progressive backing him up. I love Booker’s positivity. Abrams is well rounded and can talk about progressive ideas, specifically “identity politics” in such a universally approachable way. As much as it will be important to chose a VP who represents the party better, it is important for Biden to chose someone who will represent a hopeful future. This will inspire the party and the country and provide an important contrast to the Trump Pence ticket.
It's important to point out that Biden wants everyone to have healthcare too.  Sanders supports often gaslight this part of Joe's campaign.  [HEALTHCARE](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/)  >Instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to **build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.**
Ugh yes and then even if you give them examples you just get "They are just a few bad apples its not fair to judge all supporters on their behavior!" Or Bernie's defense that its not just his campaign and sure, there is bound to be shitty behavior from supporters of other candidates but:   1.) you typically see other supporters of that candidate keeping those people in check and  2.) why is the bad behavior from the Bernie supporters especially noticeable?
[removed]
wait omar and sarsour are hateful and divisive?
Yeah, I think the North/south split won’t hold much longer, the Midwest went for Trump last time and I bet Georgia and Texas would flip if dems bothered to campaign there.
Thank you!  They somehow believe Bernie is the only one who has a healthcare plan.
Us yang supporters searching for new homes (I've found mine here) have very little love for Bernie and his thugs.
The problem is she would get a bunch of death threats.
I mean the money not used would go to a general fund to help Democrats get elected. I don't know what would happen with Sanders' money. Socialist pizza parties?
I love how this just absolves Bernie and his fanbase of any responsibility.
I mean, not really. They've just been misled into believing that there is literally no difference between Trump/Republicans and more moderate Democrats even though the differences are night and day. Worse yet, they've trained themselves to ignore and deny any evidence that might show the obvious differences, even going so far as making up--and now in the information age it's as easy as sharing already made up--false information to attack and belittle anyone not beholden to their personal ideology.
Eh, same tactics, different identity though
Forgot no, considered irrelevant because there's plenty that aren't, absolutely.  EDIT: editing to note that I see your self-clarification below
Not if it’s wearing a mask!
I thought COVID19 had been shown to only be transferable via the lungs....?
It's not that I disagree with her or her sentiments. I disagree with how she talks at people and how she bludgeons them even when we mostly agree.  I had a colleague from New Jersey who was like this. When I told her that I felt that she talked down to me and disrespected me even when I agreed with her she said "No you do not." I was like uhhhh, you cannot tell someone how they feel. AOC comes off like this and I think it might be her NYC culture. It's abrasive and offensive to my Midwestern sensibilities. AOC makes me go -_- when she is moralizing fellow liberals.
“The most awful things moralizers do is ridicule, belittle, and try to berate those who don’t think or behave like they do. Their goal is to make people feel ashamed and guilty not because they’re necessarily worried about others’ moral values, but because they want their narrative to become the law.”  Yes, thank you for providing me a word for this! This explains a lot!
Technocratic wonks don't like vague policies and excessive moralizing. Show me how X actual causes Y.  I think Sanders campaign is poorly run because it is filled with YES persons and they believe their own hype.
I’m well aware of Sanders positions and I don’t like them. I’m also well aware that he referred to blacks in South Carolina going for Biden as “the establishment.” The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree with his followers playing the blame game and being divisive. Not interested in him or being part of a coalition of trolls and bullies.
These are my picks too! Booker was my #1 but when I saw he was receiving no support I hopped to Warren, now Biden. I would love to see Abrams or Booker as VP.
It's incredibly stupid. It's such a either/or view of politics and implementation. It's as if because I am voting for working within the existing but expanded framework that I immediately want all sick people to die.
Yep. I'd maybe prefer single-payer eventually, but if that won't pass congress i'll gladly take this.
Yeah. I'm not going to keep beating a dead horse (or drum, as it were here lol), but happy to have a community for the frontrunner that fosters a community similar to the one that I was in before (Warren pre brigading)
Let's not go down this route of disparagement. This, specifically, is an unfounded claim, most likely started by none other than Donald Trump.
I don’t have that association with them either
I know about Sarsour's ties to Farrakhan and refusal to denounce him and Omar's generally littered with conteoversies but that's all.
They gaslight, pure and simple.
Same here.  These Berners (real people IRL and not russian bots) have constantly called Yang a conman, and us YangGang morons for getting "suckered in" to Yang's speeches.  Then they follow up with #EndorseBerniePlease   Jesus man. The Bernie campaign did this to theirselves.
I'm sure she already is.
Please see my comment down below. They called me a trump republican
No. The BBs actually said it to me. When I said I wasn’t going to vote for Bernie because of how they had treated Pete they called me a trump republican.
So you would have voted for Biden if he had fewer toxic supporters anyways. My comment was aimed at those who would not have.
I'd prefer single-payer too. Healthcare is such a mess in country, scrapping it and starting over is incredibly more likely to leave us with nothing more than something better. With incrementalism under Joe, we can and will evolve it into a NHS-tier system.
Could you imagine going through Warren’s DMs for five minutes? You would lose all faith in humanity.
Sorry, you failed to make that context clear in your original comment.
So if you don't support Bernie you are a Trump supporter? So almost every American is Trump supporter? Sounds like Clinton was right when she said nobody likes these Bernie Bros
Sorry, I misunderstood you! Thought you were saying the BB’s were Trump supporters haha.  But yes, being a Pete & Warren donor/supporter for the last year has made it impossible to see myself joining the Berner movement. Too many toxic jerks out to put the rest of us in our places as closet republicans and Russian shills
Yes I wouldn’t have voted for him regardless. But not every voter is like that. Some are looking for where they belong, they want to be a part of something and feel inspired by a candidate. So when Bernie supporters are trolling and attacking people, it turns them off. It’s not realistic to expect people to ignore that and just focus on the issues. The toxic, divisive environment in America right now due to Trump is what people want to get away from.
you heard it here first folks, pretty much every ST state but california, colorado, and vermont are Trump voters!  jesus. ridiculous.
Ok. My point is that I just can't sympathize with ignoring the candidate to focus on the community when voting for a candidate.
First time in my life I voted in a democratic primary! MO for JOE!
Welcome aboard!!!! Thanks for your vote 👍
I voted Joe in STL. Let's go MO!
Was hoping for a Missouri thread [not my first time](https://imgur.com/a/uBMyzsc) but glad to build the joementum.
You go, you MO fo Joe hoe!
Here's to many more 🥂
Thanks for doing your part!
I guess you could call it MOJoe!
Hopefully this won't be your last time voting in a Dem primary. ♥️
Thanks from Virginia - and may your state be as lopsided as mine!     Signed, just another guy who isn't looking to replace one fake savior with another.
Out of curiosity was it busy? I was curious if coronavirus fears would keep people from going to polling locations
Excellent let's make it happen!
Pike County inbound soon!
Same here. Woo!!!
😃
[removed]
Awesome! And good on you for voting in the primary, regardless of who you voted for every American should be exercising their right to vote.
[removed]
Why did you vote for Joe?
Sorry to rain on this parade. But really curious. European here. Why dont you guys want free healthcare? What's that all about?
I voted Republican in the primary in the 2016 primary and democrat in the general. This time around it’s democrat both times.
You've seen Joementum, now get ready for...
Polls opened at 6am. I was there at 6:04 and third in line. But I saw people walking out as I was pulling in and more people pulling in as I was leaving.
Bernie underperformed in every state, even losing several states he was expected to win. Biden won along working class people, minorities, and northern white affluent suburbia.   13 of 14 states had increased voter participation and 10 of them went to Biden by larger than expected gains.  Bernie’s support has tanked since 2016.   This myth of Bernie being able to draw out voters that aren’t usually engaged was destroyed one week ago. Bernie went all in holding nothing better than a pair of tens and Biden called.   Bernie can’t win support in his own party, to the point where trump and other republicans are encouraging their people to vote for Bernie because they know he’s an easy win for the gop up and down the ballot.
Because taking care of my fellow citizens isn’t American. That’s a European thing. Here, we take care of ourselves.
American here that does want free healthcare. I would really like an answer to this question as well.
I love the Democrats for the fact that every four years I, an Anarchist, can stand shoulder to shoulder with you, the political equivalent of the cream in an oreo, and we find common ground.  I've always looked for pragmatic candidates just for this reason. It's not that I want MY WAY to win... I've just always wanted a seat at the table. That's what Joe is saying... We are building bridges.
Republicans shamelessly rigging the process against Bernie /s
Welcome! So glad we're binging in new people.  Out of curiosity, who got your vote in 2016? And what pushed you away from Trump?
Exact same situation for me. And from MO as well! Voting Biden today never felt so good
It wasnt busy remotely. Went at about 1 and didnt even wait in a line.
Why don't you want to be like a European?
I do want free healthcare.  However, I don't believe in Bernie's ability to deliver free healthcare, so that is not the primary issue I am voting on.
It would be great if Joe could adopt Pete's policy of decriminalizing all drugs. Sounds radical at first, but makes a **lot** of sense.
I guess you missed the part where he clearly stated  last year he voted republican in the primary and then Democrat in the general lol.
Hilary.   And trump. Trump pushed me away from trump.
Surely though Bernie saying hes going to try is better than Biden not trying at all?
I don't disagree. I'd like to see a more fleshed out plan with a greater public voice in how we regulate, test, and price drugs all together.  I think it's quite possible to slide all of this into a comprehensive plan to get our pharma industry back in line with human needs with out destroying the industry at large. Not only do we need to look at psychedelics in mental health, like how ketamine is working amazingly well for acute suicidal ideation. But also we need to look at drugs like insulin and HIV medications and figure out how to make them widely distributed at low cost.  We should also be looking at impressive leaps in locally driven health care, like neighborhood nurses, that is turning the health outcomes around in 3rd world countries. If it works there, it'll be stunningly good for us here in the states, putting people who would be SAH to work doing care work. Including prescribing low risk meds.  It's a big world and there are huge ideas. We need people like you to push the narrative.
I meant in the republican primary. Totally get the point on Trump!
No, it's not. If either way I'm not going to get free healthcare this election cycle, then I have more important priorities, like winning in November. I want Trump out of the White House and I believe Joe Biden is the best chance for that. He has broad support that Bernie lacks and cannot win without. Bernie promised a revolution with huge voter turnout and that hasn't materialized, while Biden is the one who has actually motivated his supporters to show up.
Interesting opinion great thanks for explaining
Ill agree that Sanders isn't getting people to show, but Biden really isn't either. It's all of us who just won't allow another trump presidency.
She needs some time to take a deep breath after seeing this!
I like how you labeled Biden as Biden even though it's an image of Biden
We never thought Warren was a snake.  She was the only true progressive in the race, and I sleep better at night knowing Warren is watching our financial system.
I would've liked to have voted for Warren.  I'll be happy as hell if she forces Biden to support reversing his stance with creditors, it's the biggest mistake he's made in his career, IMO
You guys are amazing! Truly appreciated ❤️
Sanders was the one who betrayed Warren.  He has exactly one friend and he managed to alienate that person and their supporters.  It was one-sided; he has no friends.
Biden's got that swagger.
Let’s goooo Biden, let’s try winning against Bernie and bringing it home in November!!!
Biden is the real progressive!
[removed]
it’s the first meme i ever made 😜
Wait that’s Joe Biden!?
It was a great touch
"first step, Be Biden"
Need to help meme bots to prep the firehose
Pete's a progressive, but that went over a ton of peoples heads for some reason.
Harris, Castro, and Booker were a progressive.   I even think Biden and Buttigieg are progressives. You'd have to go to people like Delaney,  Bullock, or Bennet so start finding actual moderates.    I hate the "true progressive thing.  You don't have to be 100% to the left on every issue to be progressive. Warren is a populist progressive.   She can also be pragmatic and is not a snake.
Joe would be more progressive on basically every issue than any president we've ever had- if he doesn't qualify as a progressive, who does?
please explain to me how sanders is not a true progressive.
I agree, but he is from Delaware.  You could argue that he is supporting his constituents.
But unironically
Yes, people age.  Well done.  Biden will be viewed as a great President who built a phenomenal coalition of anti-Trump Republicans, Independents, and moderate Democrats.  Cheers.
Still a quality meme!
Keep it up
We are slowly learning to be Biden bros.  I made my first meme for Biden this year. ;)
This is actually really well done. I make like two memes a month and have never did such a clean job with an edit.
If you sound nice you aren't allowed to be revolutionary, it's like a rule  More seriously Pete had some of the most progressive or outright "extreme" plans in the race -- 15 SCOTUS justices? SCOTUS electing its own justices?? -- it's just that he's better at explaining them without making you feel like he's going to burn down your house if things don't go his way.   And honestly I don't want to speak for him on it but that's a skill a lot of gay people I know have, as a learned survival skill. You learn how to sound agreeable, *and* how to be authentic to yourself while still sounding agreeable.
It’s a rule of modern American politics. You can’t be put together, clean cut, well spoken, make valid points, preach inclusion AND be a progressive. Duh!
[deleted]
Exactly. Joe has also gotten the same treatment as others on this. His policies are more progressive than people give him credit for.
Because the movement is actually all about him. A true progressive understands compromise and humility.
It's only okay to represent the will of your constituents when I agree with them.
I didn't like that argument when people defended Bernie's shitty gun votes & I don't like it now.     I'll take the overwhelming good that Biden's done, with the tiny bit of bad, but I'd prefer for him to reverse his stance.     Also Delaware needs to change it's damn laws corporate tax shelter laws or be reigned in by the federal government, but that's a different discussion entirely.    [Oh, and another thing](https://mobile.twitter.com/NJGov/status/1230662174823079936)
Exactly! BTW. Trump is president. If they look back with confusion.. believe me.. that because of Trump.
Cool! Yeah, we need Biden bros. with a much healthier attitude...
Biden Brothers™
yet your lates Bernie Bros meme is perfect! And thank you so so much!!! 🙏🙏
Well not if you're a man at least. I'd say Warren was all of those things and people understood she was progressive.
[Because he is.](https://i.imgur.com/DLpSzlx.jpg)  You obviously haven't tried to figure it out.  And as he said, if you cant get what youre promising done, multiplying by 0 is wait for it...0.  I mean come on. Progress is in the name.  E-did I win?

Like I said, I agree.  But if he didn't support the state's biggest industry I doubt he would have been a Senator for so long.  More a political reality than anything.
Delaware is a small state with really only two industries that employ people: chemicals and banking. Anyone representing Delaware that came down hard against credit card co's would be out on their ass in a recall election.
Wholesome memes. 🙌🏻
Fair point. But (and I say this as an admirer and someone who would likely vote for her one day) she gives me middle school substitute teacher vibes
There was nothing humble about staying in the race in 2016 after he was mathematically eliminated. There’s nothing compromising about a man so stubborn he couldn’t get any legislation passed with like minded progressive like Barney Frank (who said no one could work with him). And he’s compiled a personality cult base that adores him and doesnt even seem self aware much of the time.  Seriously, *read this sentence*:  > he is the most humble politician in America.  Okay Donald Trump, do all the best people think he’s the best too?
Not stripping people of bankruptcy protection is absolutely not coming down hard against cc companies.  And I do not think that Biden, an incumbent since the 70s, would've faced any significant backlash for not supporting that one bill
[removed]
His logic was to protect lower income families from being gouged on higher interest rates on loans, which is what lenders do what when bankruptcy protections make their business riskier

Found in r/Politics of all places - this is how you push back against the Sanders narrative
Ar-politics will soon be liberated from Bernie Brothers spam!
Funny that the billionaire narrative is still going even after he won states where he didn't spend a dime.  Voters for Joe.
Social Justice Dems: "We need to do a better job of listening to black people."  Also Social Justice Dems: "Fucking blacks are so goddamn gullible getting duped by the media! Why are they too stupid to realize that they actually prefer Bernie?"
Lol blaming billionaires for Biden’s success when he beat Bernie like a 🥁🥁🥁 without any money or organization
JOE TAKE MY ENERGY
You can actually find pretty decent comments if you head to Controversial.
/r/politics is lost. It will never be recovered, they only allow anti-american stuff.  Joe doesn't hit the front page, and nothing mildly right leaning makes it either.
And Biden got all his votes so far spending far less money than Sanders.
Probably the only way it can be liberated is if Joe Biden wins in November.
Consider this... Their mass brigading of the front page is not going to help. It annoys people.   In trees, bernie bros downvoted people like me who say "it doesn't matter who, we are voting blue in November." AND then the people who come in and say " in what reality would Trump be better than Biden?"  The mod team is trying to control it, it's a cannabis sub... they're not winning voters. They're screaming to their echo chamber.  We need to remember that the battle is fought OUT THERE where people vote. On here, we battle for hearts and minds.
Biden has spent significantly less than Bernie (and obviously isn't even in the same universe as Bloomberg). If you're concerned about the influence of money in politics you should be excited that Biden has done so well while spending so little. A candidate who knows he can win while being outspent by his opponents is a candidate who will feel less beholden to donors.
Holy shit, never read anything like this on sandersforpresident or politics. This statement that I am responding to is legitimately more biased and racist than anything I've read in othwr places.
Wow I thought Bernie supporters were supposed to the the rude ones.   Way to lump millions of people into your little straw-man. Big help.
Sort by controversial for inconvenient truths.
For the past year the top post of every pro Biden or Pete post even things like polls would have the top comment "see you in the controversial tab". That kind of became where normal discussion could happen and probably what the sub would look like without astroturfing.
Malarkey
> It will never be recovered  Naw. *Every* primary cycle since creation it's been taken over (or nearly so) by the supporters of one candidate, and then when that candidate loses, the sub gets back to normal quite rapidly.  But yeah, that "normal" includes the firm rejection of anything right-leaning.
Nah, once Bernie's campaign is officially suspended (so, the convention), it will get dramatically better. Our Revolution astroturfs the fuck out of r/politics. There was a day last year where it was like a switch flipped on reddit. Overnight, r/politics went from just being a slightly hysterical but reasonable-ish lefty board, to suddenly being all Sanders all the time, with pro-Sanders posts suddenly going from a few thousand points for the biggest ones, to tens of thousands for every single one, but no increase in comments. Once the money shuts off for that garbage, the spam will subside dramatically.
Nah, wait for next Tuesday lol. Recent polls show Biden leading in Missouri and Michigan.... *before* Amy, Pete, Bloomy & Warren dropped out, *and before* the whopping Joementum results from Super Tuesday.  The final wipeout may be on March 17, where Biden's strong support in the south would win him Arizona & Florida.  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/florida/)  for a Floridan poll example.  Illinois just needs for Biden to trumpet "Obama, Obama, Obama!" to also win; and Ohio has already shown to favour Biden in this Jan poll:  [https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/ohio/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/ohio/)  &#x200B;  By March 17, I strongly guarantee that many of the Bernie bros will go back to their caves and away from ~~Ar-BerniesBiggestSub~~ Arrrrhhhh!-politics lol.
That’s why I’m so glad we didn’t get Bloomberg, if people accused him of being the same as Trump it would be hard to argue.
This is such a great point but I feel it will still fall on a lot of deaf ears.
I thank the people who take the karma hit to post pro-Biden stuff there though.
Someone should make an r/malarkey link that just redirects to arrrgh politics
It really is.
It's not new, reddit after the strange Ron Paul debacle has fallen to what amounts to communism.  I blame the loss of tumblr, all their crazies came over here.
Our Revolution astroturfs EVERYTHING on reddit and it's extremely obvious. They also allegedly paid protestors to disrupt campaign events for Pete, and fund hit pieces in some of the trash rags like the Intercept/Current Afairs.    I look forward to the day Joe gets the effort started to overturn Citizens United and puts an end to these 501c(4) dark money groups. The irony that Bernie is the candidate benefitting the most from them is palpable.
That’s a good description of r politics during election season: thousands of upvotes for anything related to Bernie no matter how trivial or minor the source, but relatively few comments. Letter to the editor for some small town newspaper that says, “Hooray for Blurby Sanders”? Have a thousand upvotes! But no one bothers to comment.   I saw the same thing in 2016 that you mentioned: when Bernie finally suspended his campaign (and presumably stopped paying for social media manipulation), r politics went back to normal overnight. It was like when Christmas morning came to Whoville.
You can count with my Floridian vote.
Illinois representing -- I don't even need him to give the big O battle cry to get my vote. Probably wouldn't hurt, though!
[removed]
I mean, it shouldn't be that hard to argue that Bloomberg is substantially better than Donald Trump, even though a billionaire buying his way in would be infuriating.
Cheers to those of us who have hung out in r/politics long enough to remember when it was a Ron Paul circle jerk. It’s been through a few regime changes.
[removed]
Just wanna point out, there were *two* Ron Paul Debacles.   For historical evidence on the general issue, [here's a r/politics thread from 12 years ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6573n/paul_vs_kucinich_comic/).
BuT PeTe aNd jOeS bIlLIOnAiReS
You lose me when you named Our Revolution as some super-powerful PAC when they barely have raised $100k this year. Claiming they pay people to disrupt rallies is something a MAGA idiot says.  I would like to think Biden supporters aren't akin to Trump ones, but you're not really helping your case.
The switch in 2016 was downright eerie... Hillary supporters the day before would get completely dog piled and shouted down with tons of highly upvoted conspiracy theories and noise like she was the worst person alive. 1-2 days later 95% of the negativity just completely evaporated and the remaining toxicity that had been getting hundreds up upvotes the day before were suddenly going negative. It was like a huge breath of fresh air and her supporters could actually come out of hiding and advocate for their candidate again.  How quickly the switch happened really made me realize how disingenuous a lot of the anger and “Bernie or bust” bluster was. For many it’s just a negotiation to try and *force* people to vote for their preference. Then when it could no longer help anymore most dropped the facade and only a small portion were left suddenly arguing alone for a position they thought was widespread, but turned into a minority *overnight*.
I am an non-American invested in your politics, as I know that American politics will have a ripple effect onto other countries.  So out of curiosity, may I know why you are voting for Biden? Haha thanks!
Ok comrade
He has many of the same weaknesses though, not releasing taxes, racism, sexism. Obvi Id vote for him in the general over trump, but I think a larger than average number of dems would go third party or stay home.
Haha glad I'm not the only one who remembers. I was too young to really understand a lot of it, but I remember it

It's almost as if billionaires are held to the same $2800 limit as everyone else, and it's all reported on their FEC filings. The same can't be said about Our Revolition's dark money. It could come from billionaires, russian oligarchs, criminals, republicans, etc.     Publically funded elections are the only answer, but until that becomes a reality I'm fine with people taking money from billionaires to beat Donald Trump, so long as it's disclosed in the open.
You lose me when you don't realize (or you lie about the fact) that there is both an Our Revolution PAC, as well as an Our Revolution 501c(4) dark money group.  The PAC discloses *some* of their donors in an effort to obfuscate the fact that the dark money group discloses neither their donors, amounts, nor expenditures.     It's surprising to me that the people who claim to take election finance issues the most seriously are so blind to what's happening under their own nose (and what they're likely contributing to).      The reason you don't hear about it more is because the people who whine the most about donors this cycle are the ones benefitting from it.

Well, if you had to choose with a man that was vice president under our most precarious economical moment in decades and helped this country go forward while promising to unite us vs a guy who hates the party he is running in to the point that he has been saying he wants to destroy it and rebuild it on his image, someone who doesn't believe supply and demand is real and on top of that is offering populist ideas to buy votes while others magically pay for it. Tell me, for whom would you vote?
I agree that he has a lot of weaknesses, but with Trump purging anyone who's not a loyalist from the military, justice department, and various intelligence agencies, I'm just so frustrated that anyone considers staying home.  Several democracies around the world have collapsed to authoritarian right wing populists over the last decade (Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Brazil probably), and we're moving there fast.  The 'ballot box' window is closing rapidly.
Four links about the same thing, but not much substance and 1 article said Sanders even has tried to distance himself from Our Revolution for that same reason. Funny, I've never heard of Joe Biden saying the same thing.  You like to throw links at people, I can too:  [https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/486281-the-no-super-pac-oath-is-dead](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/486281-the-no-super-pac-oath-is-dead)  [https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/05/obama-operatives-biden-supporters-dark-money-grp/](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/05/obama-operatives-biden-supporters-dark-money-grp/)   [https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-says-i-didnt-change-my-opinion-after-reversing-position-on-dark-money-super-pac-cash](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-says-i-didnt-change-my-opinion-after-reversing-position-on-dark-money-super-pac-cash) (I hate that I had to use the Washington Examiner as a link but they were the only site w/o a pay wall)
Definitely Biden for sure. And I say this as someone supporting Bernie in 2016.  I guess the Super Tuesday vote was a message from Americans that the last thing you all want is to swing from one political extreme to another like a pendulum; and some form of predictable normalcy is much favoured.  FYI, I also hope Biden gets Yang as VP to secure the youth vote and Trump "swing voters" in the coming general election; as Yang is the only other Dem actively proposing modern solutions to modern problems.  Whether you agree or disagree, at least Yang is actively bringing solutions like UBI into the conversation to help deal with the impacts of the 4th industrial revolution, which is something that both Biden & Obama are also greatly concerned about.
>offering populist ideas to buy votes while others magically pay for it  I don't understand. Are you saying that free universal healthcare is magical or that is Bernie campaigning for something else that hasn't succeeded in other countries.
I’m frustrated with people who don’t vote too. Good thing Joe is a unifier, hopefully we get good turnout for him.
Cool, so we agree that Our Revolution is shady as fuck? You sending me links about another 501c(4) doesn't make Bernie less of a hypocrite, and neither does him paying lip service about a group he literally started in the first place and two of his campaign managers have been president of.     You guys see a conspiracy in every shadow, but nothing about Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver literally being presidents of OR strikes you as suspicious?  I thought Bernie hated the Citizen's United ruling so why is he putting people in charge of his campaign who exploit  it shamelessly?
Not a Yang ganger but I am really glad he ran. Thanks to him a lot of things that were being ignored are finally getting attention. We don't talk enough about what AI and automation are doing to our labor force and economy.  Yang almost single handedly brought those ideas into the limelight and he deserves all the credit for it.
> I don't understand. Are you saying that free universal healthcare is magical or that is Bernie campaigning for something else that hasn't succeeded in other countries.  I am saying that in order to succeed you need a plan to raise money for it and fixing the issues that makes medicine everyday more expensive. Sanders is the only candidate that didn't have a viable plan.
It's weird, but I always thought that countries could try to copy policies that worked in other countries before trying to invent their own solutions. In my head, I'm just comparing our issues with how I was stuck on a programming problem at work and the boss told me to just google the solution instead of trying to reinvent the wheel.

Now I have to explain an erection during a meeting... I should have listened.
We need more beards in politics
If [it worked for Abe Lincoln](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Bedell), it will work for Pete!
Keep? Has he actually grown one? I thought this particular picture is photoshopped.
We'll never know.   But maybe in 2028...haha jk......unless...?
Would have been an unfair advantage. Another example of the selfless humbleness of pete

I'm a straight man.  Or, I was.  And then, um
Same here 🔥
A man who fluently speaks 8 languages.
Lol it’s Pete Buttigieg with a Beard
I forgot about the Beto Beard and clicking on that article without a thorough understanding of what I was getting into gave \*me\* an existential crisis
Photoshopped
Trudeau now has one!
I’ll be honest, Ted Cruz’s beard is kinda growing on me. Kinda makes him look like a civil war reenactor. If he left the senate and became one I think we’d all be cool with that too.
Taft was the last President to have facial hair. I hope we get the next one within my lifetime!

I think he's grown one before.
Future former straight man?
Is it Pete Buttigieg? I thought maybe but the beard threw me. I’m awful with faces and I usually use hair to remember. If they change their hair style, there’s a very good chance I won’t recognize them.

lol remember when he had that goatee thing? i need that trudeau back
He looks older with it.
He is an idiot but yes, he looks a tonne better with it VS without

He didn't know how one word translates and you think that means he doesn't know Spanish? That's insane, Americans really have no grasp of how difficult it is to become fluent in another language.
You’re right. I’ll call all of my fellow LGBT folks and tell them to stop making beard jokes.
Speaking another language is hard. I studied French for about 5 years and was never at the level Pete was with any of his multiple languages. Speaking it to me is the hardest thing. Reading it, writing it and listening is easy.   You sometimes just get a brain block if you’re translating in your head. I remember learning techniques to help overcome that but it’s hard just knowing English and learning French. I couldn’t imagine have a bunch of other languages rattling around up there.
[removed]
I mean, that's certainly not fluency. I work with people who have learned english as a second language and they've never forgotten simple things like "this evening."  edit: why the downvotes?Are we supposed to pretend anyone who can count to 10 in a language is a fluent speaker? Speaking a language at that level takes a serious commitment, people spend years learning languages immersed in those countries and still speak with heavy accents and awkward grammar. It's not an insult to say he's not fluent, even if that was one of his "qualifications" for presidency
You should probably do that, yeah, thanks.
I don't know how instead of switching to english when he was searching for a word he didn't accidentally flip to, like, Norwegian, I feel like I'd be doing that constantly if I knew multiple other languages
[removed]
It's not fluency, but there are nuances between not knowing a language and being fluent in it. The people you work with are likely at a very high level of english if they're able to have it as their working language. They're also living in an English-speaking context. Most people who learn English never get to that level.   Lots of people know English and have studied it for many many years in school but wouldn't be able to come up with what a specific word is on the spot. Americans seriously have no idea of how difficult it is to learn a second language.
Life’s a lot more fun if you lighten up, you know. Go to a drag brunch and have a mimosa, just try not to get too offended, sweetie
I can’t say for sure how it works knowing multiples since I’m very much a novice in French especially since I’ve stopped studying it and that is the only other language I’ve studied. I do know some swear words in Spanish that have come in handy over the years lol.  But I remember having to do oral exams in college and there’s that moment where your brain is trying to catch up with your mouth and your mouth is trying to catch up with your brain and it all of a sudden just blue screens and the only word you can think of in that language is definitely not the word you need. I imagine it’s like that for him sometimes but it’s like multiple blue screens at once.
I mean, I would call them functionally fluent. My point was learning a language is very hard as you say, especially as an adult. I studied Russian for years, I would never say I'm fluent in it though, I speak it like a little baby. Buttigieg and is proponents would be better severed if they didn't insult the sophistication of languages by saying he was fluent in every language he can count to 10 in
You need to check your behavior and the way you interact with people. Have a good night.
I've seen quite a few interviews and whatnot and I don't believe he claims to be 100% fluent in his secondary languages.  He is honest and humble when he describes his proficiency level from what I've seen.  The legendary "fluent in 38474838 languages" exageration is a bit out of his control, granted he doesn't go around making a huge effort to dispell it.
Warren supporter joining Team Joe
Help yourself to some malarkey-free soft serve.
Welcome.  Pragmatism is driving a lot of us.  A Bernie nomination is a guaranteed loss of Florida in November.
I'm a recent Pete refugee (about a zillion of us are).  My sympathies for having to give up on a great candidate, and hats off to you for picking yourself right away up and turning around to ask how *else* the good can prevail.  I (obviously) think you're calling this one right.  There are tons of voters disgusted with Trump who are ripe for the harvest by a candidate who welcomes them in instead of scaring them off.  Here's hoping to see a ton of Warren-written legislation passing a new, McConnell-free Senate!  > I hope that Joe can weather Burisma   "but her emails" shows how the other side will harp endlessly on some BS accusation no matter who's nominated.  Hopefully the media will cooperate a bit less this time in signal-boosting it!
Welcome! Former Pete supporter who is in the same boat. Bernie may be closer to me politically, but him and his supporters frustrate me and he will lose to Trump.  I wasn’t excited for Biden initially but I’ve come to love this campaign in the short amount of time I’ve been here. You’ll love it too!
Welcome! I’m also significantly more left of Biden but am with him for all the reasons you outlined. Senate majority leader Warren sounds pretty good if you ask me!
You speak for me. All of these reasons are why I started lurking around this forum last week. Still deeply into Senator Professor Warren's vision, but oddly, I think Joe will get us there quicker than Bernie. It will be incremental, but we'll get there. Add to that Joe's heart and humanity and optimism, and I think we can bring this country together, 'heal the country's soul', and end this national nightmare.
Please remember it was the Obama/Biden admin that embraces the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Glad to have you join, former Warren and Buttigieg supporter here
Former Betomaniac here. What I love about Joe's camp is he doesn't ask you to stop loving Liz to belong. Your in the right place.
Honestly, the majority of people who have ever even heard the word Burisma and paid any attention are rabid Trump supporters anyway. There’s a reason Trump nearly impeached himself trying to get some dirt on Biden: he knows Joe rebuilding the Obama coalition is the worst news for him.
Next year is a census year (more gerrymandering), probably a supreme court justice (Ginsburg, a lib could be replaced by Trump, it’s like 3 libs, 5 cons, 1 moderate now), this will set dems back 10-15 years even more. In truth if bernie wins we gotta get behind him. although I dont think switching one mega conservative with a mega left will work with senate races also in November. the moderates republicans that dislike trump could give dems a lead in the senate.
Welcome! I'm a Team Pete refugee and find Team Joe very friendly!
I see no malarkey in this post
Team Pete here to say hi and welcome to our new home. Glad you're here.
Warren voters are supposedly the most highly educated of the lot, so we shouldn't be surprised by this type of rational thinking. If Bernie voters were this rational, they would have picked Warren instead, then the party would have rallied around her instead of Biden (sorry but it's true) and we would be united already. A total lack of strategic thinking.
Sorry, I know how you must feel. I've admired Liz Warren all throughout her career and agree, she has many many good ideas. Of course Joe Biden will listen to her, he's already got a long career of working side by side with her. Once all the hullabaloo of the nomination process is over, when Joe beats Drumpf like a drum, he will work with everyone. I've worked in federal government for the majority of my career and know leaders need to hear all the voices. Joe's center-left and Liz might be more to the left but that's normal under the big Democratic tent. They'll know how to get their wins together. Welcome, welcome, welcome!!
Welcome!  I liked the thought Warren put into her policies and her plans to pay for them.  When talking about her plans she always linked specific taxes with specific programs, so that people could actually see the good work taxes could do.  She wanted to tax the rich not because they were immoral, but because they could afford it.  I'm sure she will still accomplish great things in either the Senate or in somebody's administration.
1. Your support matters.  2. Warren was too far to the left for me, BUT I think she had a lot of important plans that Biden lacks. I particularly believe very firmly in co-termination as a solution to the disconnect corporate boards have from their company’s best interests, and was ecstatic when she entered the campaign with that. Everyone should read her plans and learn from them.
Bernie-supporter here, i really hope Biden can fend off the Ukraine-smears coming his way too, at the end of the day we all want Trump gone.
Warren and her supporters are key to winning the Senate back, IMO.  The blue wave was fueled by flipping traditionally Red suburban districts by soccer moms.  I think the most astute voters might be Warren voters.  I really hope they jump in and help, Kick Mitch out.    Amy Army member.
From one former Warren fan to another, welcome to Team Joe. I support him now for many of the same reasons as you, and the people here have been nothing but kind and welcoming.
Hello fellow Warren supporter!  I hope you find this sub as welcoming and good natured as I have.
Welcome!
Welcome, we are glad you are here!  I bet Liz has a great plan to end Malarkey!
You’re seeing a lot of the same things as so many of the rest of us, OP. I love Elizabeth. Ideal world, she would be our nominee. Real world, I love Joe and I’m very happy to fight alongside him, and her. ❤️👍🏼🇺🇸
I like the ideas of greatly discounted or even free college, and the idea of reformed health care. Other nations have it. But I am doubtful of Bernie being able to get anything passed. There's no evidence yet that he will have a majority of any kind in Congress, or even close to it, and that's probably what it would take. He's seen as too far left.  But the number one priority to me above anything is beating Trump. I think the "socialist" label that Fox and Republicans are drilling into voters minds will keep him from winning. In the USA, it's just not going to win. We've been yelling about Russia for the past 4 years, especially Democrats, and now a candidate labeled a socialist is going to win? Average voters don't understand "democratic socialist". They hear socialist, they think of Russia. They don't think of FDR. He'll have to spend time during the debates repeatedly explaining the difference, and it won't sink in.
Welcome aboard! I supported Warren from January to February 2015 when I defected to Julián Castro due to concerns about her electability, then I defected back to her in September, and supported her until November when I defected to Biden over her opaque responses vis a vis medicare for all and her lack of detailed plans on foreign policy, as contrasted with Joe’s straightfoward approach, foreign policy plans, and inspirational rhetoric about what America is supposed to be, which no other candidate on the stage said anything like. I like a lot of Warren’s policies, but I think Biden would be a better commander-in-chief for the reasons I mentioned. Warren is uniquely great on a lot of issues, and I too hope that she has an influential role in the administration or a continued sucessful Senate career.
This day sucks and I'm sorry. Joe isn't my first choice either but imagine President Biden signing one of Warren's signature pieces of legislation in 2021!  Or... Warren taking over after accepting a VP spot...? 🤔
Hi From a Team Pete member who is lucky to have her as a Senator. Lets go win this thing!
Welcome! I came from Team Pete and have found a new home over here.   Never lose your love for Liz... Make sure it gets lived out in Joe's campaign!
Welcome from this TeamPete turned TeamJoe Floridian
I really hope she can pressure Joe into taking up her zoning/housing/infrastructure and anti-corruption initiatives. She was my close number 2 for those reasons.
I didn't start with Joe, either. But I want to work with our institutions, and maybe even make them work better. Nothing's getting through the Senate with McConnell as leader, and nobody good will replace RBG if Trump stays in office. The path to demoting McConnell runs through Biden, not Sanders. We can talk about specific legislation later, once we've taken that first step.
Another Warren voter who will be supporting Joe. Let's win in November!

Welcome to the Biden Bidet! No malarkey allowed, let's all get aboard the hype train. WOO WOO lol. and remember, biden does no diddle kids!
Joe fought for segregation while Bernie fought against it. How can you be so hypocritical
As the most cliche saying ever goes, "the definition of insanity  is **repeating** the same actions over and over again and expecting different results." Sadly, that is exactly what what Biden's ideas, policy, and positions promise.   I understand change can be uncomfortable and appear idealistic. But these same, persistent, tired attempts are what convinced enough of the American public in 2016 to believe, that of all f\*\*\*ing people, that He Who Must Not Be Named is at lease worth a shot!   Please, I beg you, open your eyes and see this once in a lifetime moment that is upon us and realize that Joe Biden will only perpetuate the same sad state of affairs that profited by bringing us to these desperate set of circumstances. Or else, get ready for Don. Jr. 2024!

The Bernie vs Biden Polls in FL tells us all we need to know.
Florida would be a landslide for Trump with Sanders on the ticket and probably lose the House seats we flipped in FL in 2018.
How many people do you think have genuinely always supported Joe and his plans on face value?
Hopefully the GOP has cried wolf so many times, between Benghazi and the emails, that the public won’t buy it this time.  And it’s unfortunate that this is a factor at all, but Biden won’t be hurt by sexism against his candidacy like Clinton was.
Ugh, you're so right on the media. They can't help but repeat every stupid thing Trump says into the megaphone because it generates clicks and makes them money. He makes himself look bad enough, I hope Joe focuses on his positive vision for America instead.
Thank you!  I wasn’t, either. At certain points already in the campaign, Joe has said things about issues that actually made me pretty upset.  But as the Super Tuesday results rolled in, and I thought about who I’d support next, a peace washed over me and I knew. Joe is the one to end this long national nightmare.
Another Pete supporter chiming in:   I really respect how the Biden campaign has not just given lip service to the Pete/Amy/Beto campaigns since the Super Tuesday endorsements.   he didn't just give a "thanks for all the fish" statement...I've seen multiple acknowledgements that "Super Tuesday victories were because of you!" messages.   Tells me he wants to lead a TEAM, not just be a megalomaniac.    Gives me hope that the best of our candidates' ideas will find a home with Uncle Joe.

Thank you!  And can you imagine??? There’ll be no malarkey there anymore if she becomes the Majority Leader.
Wheeeeee!!! Liz would school those old boys something fiersome!!
Bingo. Glad we’re both here and are working in the same direction.
I find neither point surprising at all! :) Thank you!
Thank you. That’s another thing. I believe Joe will listen. He’s shown far more capacity to do so than Bernie has.
Thanks for being upfront.  I think he can for several reasons:  1) I think the GOP has cried wolf too many times with Clinton on Benghazi and the emails. Not sure voters will buy it this time.  2) I think the House has the power to investigate the Trump kids in response. That might make Trump & the Senate GOP think twice.  3) Sexism played a huge role in the way the investigations of Clinton were conducted and the way they were covered. Biden won’t be subject to that.
Welcome! I'm not worried about the Ukraine thing. It's been beaten to death already, and I don't think it will gain traction among voters.
Hi! I have. It’s sparked some good discussion!  Let’s keep fighting for big structural change!
Biden signing Warren's bankruptcy law reform bill into law would be poetry. You could make a HBO series about that in a couple of decades.
From your lips to God’s ears.
Will. Absolutely. Do. Thank you!
Me too. I’m an urban planning masters candidate.
Bingo.
I voted for Bernie in the Oregon Primary in 2016. Don’t fucking tell me what I am and what I am not.  Bernie will set the Progressive cause back decades if he continues to refuse to work with people, to listen, to reach out, and to drive voter turnout.  Biden wants the public option. Warren floated it as a stepped approach to M4A. Even AOC said they’d settle for it if they don’t get the votes for M4A.  And I think Biden will listen to Warren more than Sanders has proved any willingness to listen to the majority of Black voters. He didn’t talk to Clyburn. He didn’t go to Selma. He can’t articulate how his plans will specifically address structural racism against Black people.  I am listening, however. That’s a big part of why I’m shifting to Biden.
This may shock you, but:  1) People change 2) The overwhelming majority of Black voters know about this from 45 years ago and support him now because they’ve seen him change.
1) It seems like you are committed to only looking at things from what matters to you and your perspective. A whole, massive host of people don’t pick their candidates based on a policy checklist, but on a ton of factors both tangible and intangible.  2) Biden is not fighting sexism or 3 decades of right-wing conspiracy theories for the nomination like Clinton was.  3) Biden is as good as or better than Sanders at attracting white working class voters to his cause. Especially union voters in the midwest. That’s a HUGE difference between himself and Clinton.  4) Trump is now a known commodity with consistently low approval ratings rather than the plucky outsider upstart that might have new ideas to change our circumstances. He’s shown a great deal of the country that he had no ideas and is completely incompetent. He’s fucked over farmers, folks on Obamacare, and so many others.  5) Bernie seems content to throw giant states like Florida away with his Castro comments, content to ignore central pillars of the Black community in South Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi - who we’ll need to turn out in November to beat Graham and Hyde-Smith, and re-elect Jones.  6) Bernie’s revolution is great in terms of policy. But he isn’t building a big enough coalition to get young people and disaffected voters to the goddamn polls in big enough numbers to win in states he carried handily 4 years ago!  7) Political change comes about through coalition-building, and Bernie, his campaign, and many of his supporters turn their noses up at doing that work if they perceive the people they might court to be even slightly “impure,” however they define that. So even if he wins, it’s going to be hard to see how he’ll get anything done with Congress while in office.  2020 is not 2016. The electorate is different, the political climate is different, the power structure is different, and Biden is not Clinton, and widespread public perception of the two is different.  Stick your head outside the echo chamber here or there and listen to what other people value. I think you may be surprised that the world is a bigger place than you’ve known thus far.
Read my post and comment history.  Either that or stock up on more tinfoil for that hat of yours.
And PA. An anti-fracking stance is a stance against the state's largest industry.
I also think that, at least last time, the media kept cycling through this:  "Hmm, it's the daily new atrocious and stupid thing Trump said or did.  OK, but we have to be balanced, so we have to say something bad about Hillary.  Mention the emails again, I guess."  And the effect was voters thinking, "I guess I've heard some bad things about Trump, but I can't remember them very well.  But I've heard a whole lot about those emails, so that must have been something REALLY, REALLY BAD.  I guess Trump isn't as bad as Hillary."
I used to be ambivalent about him (also on team Warren), but watching some videos in the past few days, such as him comforting Meghan McCain about her father's cancer diagnosis, I'd be really proud to have him as a candidate. He's more compassionate and empathetic than almost any other politician, and I think he'll draw a stark contrast with the bully in office. The country needs some comfort and stability after Trump, and I think he'll make progress on the issues as well.
I flitted between several candidates (including Warren)...ended up on Joe because of some of my older relatives...the types you are paying attention to.  He does have quite a few legitimately good policies that twitter "snarkers" tend to overlook...and some are surprisingly progressive. If you are interested, read up on his plans on HBCUS...He wants to implement Bobby Scott's SAFE act, too, and even expand on it. .  Another thing that does make me feel good about Joe is he doesn't hold grudges...and he's willing to build coalitions and listen to other people and admit when he's fucked up. I know he and Warren have had their beefs in the past, but allegedly (and I wish I could find the link) back in 2015 when he was thinking of running he even asked her to a meeting and approached her for ideas and offered  VP.  So I wouldn't be shocked if he listened to her seriously, not just as an olive branch sort of thing, and offered her a cabinet position...although I want her as Senate Majority Leader myself (fuck Schumer).   I'm not sure if you are aware of her, but you may want to check out Gwen Moore..I've seen some connected political people floating around her name, along with Val Demings,  as possible VP picks. Moore is very progressive, and I feel like more late to Joe voters who were in Warren's camp would be happy with her (and probably fine with Demings, too....she's center left and more progressive than most FL politicians).
Take heart from the fact that historically, progressive policies typically get enacted when an "establishment" figure is helped/pushed by a grassroots swell of momentum. When we've been at our best, both work in concert. Give Biden a Senate majority at his back - and then make sure he uses it!
I’m not going to speak on their behalf, but for me, what I like about Joe is that he will listen to people who don’t agree with him about certain issues and include those people in the policy-making process. I don’t think Biden’s policies are perfect—they aren’t. But I am confident that he will work with the breadth of our party to reach a point where the vast majority of people in the party—from moderate to liberal to leftist—can be satisfied with his platform. I don’t have the same confidence that Sanders can reach that consensus within the party.
Believe it. Look at my posting and comment history.  Bernie can’t build a coalition and his inability to reach out to Clyburn, show up to Bloody Sunday in Selma, or turn out young voters in enough numbers to support his revolution, give me great pause.  I’m a Warren supporter who believes wholeheartedly that we need to move toward M4A and thought her stepped approach starting with the public option, was ideal. As opposed to Bernie’s “wave a magic wand” approach.  At least Biden wants the public option. They are agreed on that front. And Biden knows how things work from both the Executive and Legislative branches of government.  It’s not a position I take without reservations. Biden is my 4th choice out of the field we had. But he’s the highest ranked choice still in the running.  And I will vote for him with a smile on my face in May and then November.
Hi I’m a conservative. I’m here for Biden (from Pete) and specifically not here for sanders. He’s too far. And I know I’m not the only one. I’ve seen others like me.
I haven't personally seen any moderate democrats say they'll stay home or vote for Trump over Bernie (although I've heard a lot of Bernie supporters say that), I think moderates are rightly worried that Bernie wouldn't grab enough independents and republicans to win swing states. Bernie's only path would be through energizing the base, and his base is young voters. I would love it if young voter turnout increased, but we're not seeing it so far in the primary, whereas Joe has been increasing turnout in many states. When asked recently if he should expand his base to suburban voters Bernie said he doesn't have to. That kind of attitude is worrying.
The day after Pete dropped out this sub doubled in size. A very significant chunk of that is refugees from Pete's sub.
Another Warren supporter here. I'll be knocking on doors for Biden come fall. I agree with both of you. I want Warren's policies passed, and it makes sense that can happen in a Biden presidency.
Agree! Listening ... ridiculously under-rated skill set.
I do hope you are right, but then again, millions of people believe that Hillary ran a pedo-ring from a basement in a restaurant that didnt even have a basement, people can be made to believe the wildest things.
Dream big. Fight hard.
Wow good on ya!
What a well-reasoned and thorough response. Glad to have you on Team Joe.

Shouldn't we be anti fracking? Given horrible it is for the environment hopefully our next president will look to transition those workers into a different field
Yeah, I think a significant number of Trump supporters feel guilty supporting someone so immoral, so if he puts something out saying "the other candidate is corrupt too!", even if it's not very plausible, it gives them cover. They can think "well, it's all a wash, our candidate is corrupt and so is the other one, so I'm allowed to just vote on the single issue that matters to me" (tax cuts or conservative judges or whatever).
Joe Biden knows what it's like to have your kids deployed in a combat zone. He knows what it's like to grow up middle class. Joe Biden knows what it's like to grow up with a physical disability and to be relentlessly mocked for it. And sadly, he also knows what it's like to bury your children. Life has dealt Joe a shitty hand at several points, so much so that it would break a lesser man, but he instead poured his grief and frustration in to helping people.  This is why it infuriates me when people say Joe Biden doesn't inspire people. When I watch Joe Biden talk about his first wife and his daughter, or his son Beau, or how his parents raised him, he inspires me to try to be better. Of course he has his angry old man moments; everyone does. And of course he gets really passionate about some things, everyone does. But over the course of his career, Joe Biden has helped more people than everyone else in the field combined, both legislatively with things like the Violence Against Women Act, and personally, such as when he gives his personal phone number to a kid with a stutter to call when he's feeling down and needs a little help. And I'm not knocking the other candidates here, I'm just trying to explain why Joe Biden IS inspiring, at least to me, in a way none of the others are. And to be told by some he's "boring" or what have you, it's just so mind-numbingly irritating.

>Bernie can’t build a coalition and his inability to reach out to Clyburn, show up to Bloody Sunday in Selma, or turn out young voters in enough numbers to support his revolution, give me great pause.  If Bernie supporters want a one sentence reason why we are where we are right now, this is pretty much it.
READ MY POST HISTORY.  I believe Biden will be more effective getting half of what I want done (e.g., the public option) than Bernie will be getting any of what I want done (M4A).
Sure we should. We should be at 100% renewable energy and not releasing any greenhouse gases at all, but we're not even close to there yet. If you like low gas prices then you should be at least a little ok with it for now. We've become the world's leading supplier of natural gas after fighting wars over oil the past two decades.   Fracking has put a lot of Pennsylvanians to work and they vote.
He knows what it’s like to have kids deployed in combat, yet he’s a man who voted in favour of the Iraq War, who was therefore directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people, and has literal blood on his hands ?   I honestly cannot understand how people let this stuff slide so easily. It’s nothing short of disgusting.   Biden losing his son is a tragedy and genuinely I feel great sympathy for him for that, however literally thousands of people have faced exactly the same fate because of a war he voted for. Yet because they’re brown and far away, people don’t seem to care. That’s what’s infuriating
Nope. But, not coincidentally, Biden has also been endorsed by Conor Lamb, a PA rep who ran specifically on strengthening background checks instead of introducing new gun laws. That phenomenon is the magic of Biden. He can unite pro-gun politicians with anti-gun politicians, and they can find a solution together. That’s exactly the type of collaboration and unity our party needs on that issue and on many others.   Also, the implication that Biden will be too liberal for conservative voters when the other option in the primary is running on free college, socialized medicine, and *stringent gun control* is ridiculous.
The Sanders theory of politics has been shown to not work. He cannot deliver the youth turnout he claims he can. Biden has been shown to deliver the moderate suburban and rural voters that he's talked about.   That makes Biden the more electable one IMO.

I like low gas prices, but I hate the destruction of our environment far far more
Beau went to war after his dad voted for it.

Here's the funny thing. I think Sanders could have made this work had he built an inclusive culture rather than a divisive one. One of the Pod Save America guys had a great point about this, paraphrasing what he said:  >If your supporters spend the entire campaign calling supporters of other candidates rat fuck, snake, and traitor, don't be surprised when they don't gravitate to your revolution when their candidate drops out
It is this exact kind of willfully ignorant, “everything I don’t understand is stupid,” condescending, judgmental posturing that is keeping the Bernie campaign from growing its base and drawing in the kind of coalition needed to govern so far.  I have seen Bernie supporters characterize Black voters as “low information” with the same dismissive, and in that case, particularly racist, “logic.”  It may be feel good as the masturbatory form self-congratulation it is, but it is not an effective way to martial support to run a democracy full of people who believe and support different things.  Believing the right things isn’t enough. Building a coalition to achieve them is every bit as important. And a HUGE part of that is a willingness to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Then, to stay in the fight and achieve more at the next opportunity.
I'm with you, I hear you, and I respect you, but the industry is going to speak for itself and these blue collar workers in coal country WHERE BIDEN IS FROM will always vote to keep their jobs.
Conor Lamb currently represents the PA-17 in the Pittsburgh suburbs. However, he won his first election in the old PA-18, which was formerly held by [Tim Murphy,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Murphy_(American_politician))a Republican who, if you scroll to the “electoral history” section of the article, routinely won the district by double digits. It was a solid R district, and Conor Lamb won it. He won it by winning the voters Democrats need to win in 2020, and Biden receiving his endorsement is a signal that Biden can win those same voters. I have confidence in Lamb’s ability to know the voters who made him a rising star; if Biden is good enough for him, Biden is good enough for me  I can’t speak to every concern you have about gun control and Biden’s gun policy. All I can say is that Biden is a man who will listen to a variety of opinions and interest groups. He’s going to listen to people like Beto, he’s going to listen to people like Lamb, and he will undertake policy with both of those groups in mind. That’s good enough for me, and even if it isn’t enough for you or other pro-gun liberals, I hope you respect that there are people who feel very differently from you about this issue and that they deserve to have their interests represented as well.
Exactly. But I'd argue that a populist campaign inevitably results in this sort of toxicity. Populism itself is part of the problem and Sanders did not do enough to understand or counter that effect when he was first running in 2016. Now it's out if control and his attempts to put a lid on it is too little, too late.  Edit : when you act like the consolidation of moderates is a "coup" as Marrianne Williamson said or is a plot from "the DNC" instead of a legitimate exercise of ideological unification, you sow the ground for this sort of toxicity. It's somewhat Trumpian as you blast any organized resistance to you as illegitimate, immoral, and dangerous to "the people" while demanding absolute fealty from allies. And any Ally that does step out of line and disagree with you is now branded a traitorous snake/rat/etc and part of the enemy.

Joe: ". @MikeBloomberg , I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it."
This is how you expand your base of support.
People keep saying Bloomberg wasted so much money on his ads. Disagree, he attacked Trump with those ads, a huge plus in my book.
I am so happy with the coalition of moderates that has gotten behind Biden.  I definitely am not a huge fan of Bloomberg but I am happy we have the endorsement.
I don’t particularly like Bloomberg but if he wants to keep running ads attacking Trump that’d be great.
That is why Joe Biden will win in November
I would like to thank Mike Bloomberg for running a campaign without smearing anybody.
I respect Bloomberg for making this decision so quickly after Super Tuesday.
Mike filled an important role in the primary. Trump was basically the only one spending $$ on adds nationally/online with any real volume. Mike at least got *someone* with a D next to compete on the airwaves and drown out Trump.  &#x200B;  I look forward to seeing him direct those efforts to beating Trump.

Big Tent Joe
Personally, I hope that B’berg pretty much stays in the background and just pumps out the money. He isn’t a compelling speaker or campaign surrogate at all.
This is why Joe.
Inject his money straight into this campaign's veins.
I can post Bloomberg crap now without the political warning?!? Sweetness. That was a bit odd to have around.
His campaign guy on msnbc was awesome and I’m fascinated to learn more on their data game. Having done some Obama work and seeing the Hillary campaign basically ignore the David Ploufe playbook, I hope Biden gets in the Bloomberg data team to combat the GOP
He's going to launch Biden to space on his money hose
He better spend a billion bucks.
In no way did I want Bloomberg to win but as much as I dislike him on issues of racial justice, Bloomberg has the right eye for a lot of other policies I agree with him on.
He’s awesome and he went to Syracuse!!!

Hello all, I'm from the EU and I've been focusing a lot on how a Biden or Bernie vs Trump clash would look like, and this is what I've found:  Now, since this is /r/JoeBiden I get that this will come off as off-putting, and it sure is:  Trump vs Biden would go something like this:  Trump will point out that Hunter is under investigation for burisma, straight to Joe's face.  (This is true, Hunter is currently under investigation.)Biden  will try to divert, and defend, and would be right in doing so,  but this will not sway Trump voters who's heard this over and over, becoming immune to it. This is a loss for Biden.  Trump can also point to Biden's constant attempts to cut social security, even airing ads showing it. He also opposes Medicare For All, the #1 most popular issue.    He'd be right to do so as Biden's been terrible on that in the past.  Here, Biden can't do much at all. The proof is undeniable, and may well bring over potential voters.  He  can also attack Biden on his past records on segregation versus african-americans and his anti-lgbt rhetorics, along with his stance on being anti-women's rights.  This, will crush Biden. The reason is that Biden's records shows this as being the case.  Yet another thing Trump will do, because he is who he is, is to point out that Hunter Biden had sexual intercourse with his dead brother's wife. -  Tasteless, but something I definitely see Trump bringing up. - This, to an intelligent people, would not work. That said, this will work very well and will make Trump appear to be strong to his already committed voters.  Another thing is the wars. While hypocritical, it is nontheless true that Joe Biden voted FOR the disastrous oil-war (let's face it) in Iraq. Trump vocally opposed the Iraq war, calling it a "big fat mistake". - This is a loss for Biden.  Lastly, he can point to Biden's failing cognitive ability.  Biden's brain is not what it used to be. He forgets things, a lot.  He falters in his speech worse, and more often than Trump, and seems to go on complete nonsense rants out of nowhere about whatever comes to mind. The "I like when children stroke my hairy legs" ramble comes to mind, as well as the "I was arrested with Nelson Mandela" nonsense.  What Biden can say in response to these points is... quite frankly not much.  He can't point to medicare for all nor social security, because he doesn't support it, and has actively opposed these. He can't point to being against segregation, because as Kamala Harris pointed out, he even orchestrated bussing.  He  can't point to the climate, because he has consistently voted against  safety precautions to suppress climate change, and has taken fossil fuel $.  My assessment is that Trump will obliterate Biden.  \-  As for Bernie Sanders, I can't think of a single issue Bernie won't be able to handle.  Here, due to his near-flawless record, and his outrageous honesty - I have Bernie as a Strong, with a capital S - winner. He indeed fights for the people and is insanely consistent on the issues and has a humane policy overall. He favors the working class and poor, the environment, the disabled, the veterans, the homeless, the wrongfully convicted drug offenders (weed etc) and is against interventionist wars. He favors diplomacy, not needless bloodshed.  If you want to take down Trump, Bernie Sanders is the way to go.

Wait, calling people names and demeaning supports of opposing candidates because they have different ideas on getting similar things done isn’t the way?!
Are you honestly suggesting that spending a week trying to explain to everyone that "actually Castro did some cool things too" *isn't* a good way to win over voters?
In the wise words of Clay Davis: "I'll take any motherfucker's money if he givin' it away"
Wait I thought cyberbullying was the answer
And evidently, if I’m understanding correctly, the field offices he opened and people he hired will stay open to support Joe.
Both him and Steyer and to a certain extent Joe trained their fire on Trump, making sure he didn't have uncontested months to spread a positive message about himself.
Spending over half a billion on attacking Trump is worth? Ok then.
Yeah man, I bet trump supporters are only trump supporters because they’ve never heard him attacked before, I bet Bloomberg converted billions of voters.
And the money!!  I heard Biden raised over 10 million in 24 hours after SC.
And I on the other hand am a huge Bloomberg fan but Biden is so many miles ahead of Sanders I'm happy to switch over to Biden.  Wonder twins power, activate! Form of... Bliduttengerg!

Unity over division.
Me too. He’s got his drift, for sure.. but he’s gonna be on the right side of history for this fight
This. Bloomberg could do a great service to the Democratic Party, and one that I think would right all the wrongs. He could throw more money into national ads than Donald Trump's net worth (and based on rumblings, that net worth could be almost equivalent to what Bloomberg has already spent) specifically targeting Trump and helping the nominee, whoever that ends up being. Drown out the noise so to speak.
Glad to see the Trump bots out in full force in that Twitter thread.
Exactly. What a great week
But he said no to Comeys endorsement

This is the unexpected talking point for me. I'm suddenly hearing that Bloomberg had some advanced data and analytics teams. I'll be honest I didn't pay a lot of attention to him at any point, so this is a fascinating point.
>Bloomberg has the right eye for a lot of other policies I agree with him on.  Especially gun control

Taxes.  That's all Trump needs 2 win. He'll just say that Bernie is coming for 50% of your paycheck and the government will take away your rights.  Then it's the end.   Just taxes.
Nope, not a dime thus far. We may be fools, but we're winning fools.
(1) The dems haven't done anything 2 the progressives. Coming together is called tactics. Bernie and his people should've known this and been ready for it.   (b) Bernie should've changed his message to be much broader and friendlier in order to gain more followers and have access to Warren's total voters. They didn't. Bernie called her a liar and then his supporters are attacking her supporters.  That's called failure. Complete and utter lost of tactics and command.  Joe played it well and smooth and used his very solid mental capabilities to put together a group of moderates. It's the smart play.   Joe succeeded and Bernie didn't.  I'm sorry that you got hurt in the process, but that's politics and that's the kinda thing we're going to need to fight the republicans. So be a bit more forgiving and kind. Honey will unlock many doors, vinegar not so much.
1/10 troll, you can do better than this.
C'mon man, don't you have anything better to do?
Who would've thought!
It also doesn't help to complain about a candidate who should be an ally and blame her for any loss you may suffer, possibly alienating voters who might agree with you.
BTW, great username.
>"actually Castro did some cool things too"  He was really good at jailing political dissidents! World-class, even.
I like how you guys are doing the same thing you’re accusing Bernie supporters of doing.

Love this! Lmao
Some seem to think so. Glad Biden adopted Pete’s Rules of the Road.
Is it too late to earn that sweet sweet Bloomberg check for someone like me looking for work?  I guess it is, womp womp.
I wonder if there is something he/the party can do about polling offices around the country to make it more accessible to voters.  Maybe even ads about voting early to prevent these enormous wait times.
Yep
It's his money. If he wants to spend it that way, power to him.
K
And we are happy to have you!
Lmaoooooo
Troll alert. Reporting to mods...
Well you definitely live up to your username. I’ll give you that.
If you really believe that every moderate is a racist I think we have a lot we would disagree with my friend.  I believe racism is certainly an issue the candidate will have to handle whoever they end up being.
Jack Dorsey seems to truly, profoundly, wholly not give a shit about bots manipulating Twitter. I hope my perception is wrong but Twitter makes it nigh impossible not to be cynical.
Bad juju.
Iirc, decriminalize and expunge records, but he’s not on board yet for straight legalization (wants more research).  A bit of an old man stance there, but I’m sure he can be lobbied, he’s just playing it safe (which is understandable, you don’t want to cause a substance abuse problem in your country).
He also is ceding all his ground game operation to Biden which is HUGE
Bernie's politics are a bottomless pit of expenses and Republicans know it.  Bernie's M4A bill alone could cost $60 trillion (to reiterate: $60,000 billion) over 10 years, that's like 25% of entire our gross domestic product. We could rob the 1% until they're homeless and it still wouldn't pay a bill that large. And forget about "free college".  Bernie promises to lower most people's taxes in year one. Then, if he passes all of his plans, he'll bankrupt us all.
Also, don’t lose a primary and then attempt to hold the party hostage by threatening to stay home in the general if they don’t select your guy.   I’m not going to attack Sanders or his supporters, because I know most of them will end up on our team and they’re good people.  But it’s the few extremists that really make me angry.   This whole “If we don’t nominate Bernie then all the young people will stay home and hand the election to Trump...”-mentality is extremely anti-democratic.  Considering Bernie couldn’t mobilize the youth vote last night, it looks like they’re staying home anyway.  So you might as well get behind the guy that doesn’t turn off the rest of liberal America.
Are they though?
Recognizing that we shouldn't praise oppressive communist dictators?
Same. Really liked Pete's candidacy and had nothing but amazing interactions with his volunteers, online and off.
It’s still Bloomberg money, just a Biden campaign.

I love joe but it's really hard for me to get past this. And voting for don't ask dont tell. Tho with the endorsements of the other candidates I'm sure they will push him
Speaking of a few extremists...   Last night there was someone asking how this could have happened, when Bernie's reddit is so much more active than Bidens. It reminded me of the reaction in the Brexit reddit after the second vote solidly failed to stop Brexit. They just couldn't understand, when the subreddit was so active and very against Brexit. Then one guy chimes in saying he realizes now how maybe most people don't read reddit, and how echo chambers can give a false impression.   It's been really interesting to watch.
Yeah, the whole I'LL DRIVE THIS BUS OFF THE CLIFF AND KILL US ALL IF I DON'T GET MY WAY this is infuriating and incredibly counterproductive if they want to do anything but burn things Trump-style. Implementing a lot of Bernie's agenda will require years and democratic control of both chambers during that time (and like many things, like the voting rights act, could be gutted if their guard ever goes down), and people are just going to get off the bus ASAP.
Yes.
There were a lot more than just that being said. I don’t agree with everything Bernie says (I was a die hard Yang supporter). But I’d much rather have someone who I feel actually cares and will bring in new ideas. Biden and Trump agree on 75% of things. I know people always say “nothing will change with this new politician”. And that could be true with either Biden or Bernie, but at least Bernie is trying. I don’t know why democrats always try and get the moderate that no one is excited about and won’t actually attempt to make progressive change, and they wonder why they always loose? But my main point is that people here were calling out “Bernie bro’s” and then literally made a whole thread trying to use Fox News talking points to roast Bernie.
I’m no fan of Bloomberg. But I can appreciate the fact that he cares so deeply about gun violence, climate change and defeating the authoritarian wannabe in the White House. I can applaud Biden for recognizing those qualities and for putting his money where his mouth is.   At the same time come back to me when bernie turns away joe Rogans endorsement. A dude who has given a platform to racists, misogynists, and even oligarch wannabes that you claim to hate.
And how many new Bernie fans did you win today acting like this?
The UK election one can be partially explained by labour’s inexplicable strategy of being neutral on Brexit. Even if the majority of Britain was against Brexit, there wasn’t an against party other than libdem who weren’t really viable.
He cares so much about gun violence and climate change that he supported Republicans until 2019 🧐🧐🧐
Believe it or not he was a key factor in flipping the house in 2018. 18 of the 21 seats he helped including Lucy mcbath, cite his aid as a major contributing factor to the defeat of republican incumbents.   Which red to blue seats have given Bernie any credit for their seat?
>Which red to blue seats have given Bernie any credit for their seat?  Uh, the entire Squad.  Im sure Bloomberg helped many conservative Democrats won seats. Pardon my lack of enthusiasm
the 'squad' that infamously turned exactly 0 red seats lol
>Squad  >Red to blue  ????

Great picture.

omg.  This is incredible.  I just need Claire from the BA test kitchen to endorse and I'll be good
I mean, was there any doubt? If there's one thing in heaven or on earth I think we can trust in, it's that Texans don't fuck around when it comes to Whataburger.
Awesome 👍
This is just so wholesome.
Imagine you decide to go get fast food at 10 PM and JOE FUCKING BIDEN sits down in the booth next to you with BETO.
Beto looks like the definition of a older-still-fratty white Texas guy.  Don't attack me, lots of those guys are my friends. Beto here basically looks like my friend John in exactly 15 years.
Whataburger is fucking great for a fastfood burger
Holy shit Beto is tall
This does it.  I’m all in for Joe.  My #1,2,4,5th candidates have all endorsed him.
Somehow I'm loving the fact that even the VP and O'rourke have to wait in line, get a ticket, and go sit down and wait.
No one's asking the tough question: what did they order? We must know!
As a Texan, this warms my heart.
BIDEN HAS HUGE HANDS!!!  Like freaking oven mitts. I know this because he brought us pizzas in 2012.

Joe Biden tops Bernie Sanders in Washington presidential primary
Up until Tuesday I said Biden's weakest areas were the West, but that's not true anymore.
I like this:  "The primary was a big hit with Washington voters. A total of 1,333,780 votes had been counted in the Democrats' primary Thursday night. Just 230,000 people participated in the party's 2016 precinct caucuses, dominated by Sanders supporters."
A 2% margin in Washington is insanely strong.    My projections of this state had maybe a 0.5% margin as a stretch with it likely falling to Bernie.  While the turnout is also nice, realistically, the state is going Democrat no matter who wins.
This will be completely ignored on r/politics and most of Bernie’s supporters will go through life thinking he won Washington state.
> Ex-Vice President Joe Biden has finished first over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Washington's Tuesday presidential primary, after putting on virtually no campaign here. >  > Statewide totals tallied Thursday night show Biden with 491,749 votes, or 36.87%, to 464,767 votes, or 34.85%, for Sanders. >  >    Candidate | # votes | % ---|---|---- Biden | 491,749 | 36.87% Sanders | 464,767 | 34.85%  Current vote spread: 26,982  Current spread: **Biden +2.02**  The results within the article match those currently on the WA SOS site:  * https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20200310/President-Democratic-Party.html  *WA SOS site timestamp: Last updated on 03/12/2020 6:07 PM*  Edit:  [From another article:](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/primary-update-thursdays-vote-count-shows-biden-steadily-pulling-away-of-sanders/)  >A couple hundred thousand ballots remain to be counted statewide, according to estimates from the Secretary of State’s office. But barring a late reversal, Biden will wind up winning a state that many had pegged as favorable for Sanders.
Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
Of course he did
Tick...tick...tick...Bernie...
Washington state, welcome to the Anti-Malarkey Revolution 💎🐊😎🍦
Me, an American in Europe, can't read this. I fucking hate the GDPR laws those idiots in Brussels came up with.
“Joe Biden tops Bernie Sanders” is a questionable way to phrase it....
[removed]
If it was a two man race I don't think Biden would of lost California
Biden is probably favored pretty well in Oregon at this point.
I wonder if Hillary would have won WA had there been a primary that year.
Question, are caucus used in the general elections in some states? Primaries are just flat put better, with mail in ballots. All we need to do is add ranked voting.
Sanders has rowdy supporters and do everything to be heard, no wonder they do good on caucuses.
Well, it does matter for both the house and our state legislature.  We need to defend Kim Schrier's seat in the Seattle suburbs and also can flip one of the final GOP seats touching the Pacific ocean in Southwest WA in Portland's WA suburbs.   Our state legislature is still pretty narrow in the Senate and has been a big holdup to more aggressive legislation on issue alike climate change. Winning another 2 or 3 seats in the Senate will really unblock Dems from passing just about anything they want even allowing for defections.
Yep. Its swing states that matter, sadly.
Just like they still do with Iowa?

So brave.
we all know bernouts are geniuses
Especially if you look at early voting vs. same day voting. Biden won pretty all of the people who voted after Buttigieg and Klobuchar dropped out pretty easily.
It's clear he wouldn't.  He's picked up most of Pete's, half of Warren's, and nearly all of both Klobuchar and Bloomberg voters.
Especially if Harris endorsed him a week earlier, but I guess they were saving her for Michigan
She did actually
No, caucuses are not used in the general. They're dumb, for sure.   Sanders supporters spend all this time crying over how working class people work too hard, long hours with no time off, and childcare is impossible to navigate. Then demand these same people spend 2-6 hours in the middle of the day at a school gym on a Tuesday playing musical chairs while campaign surrogates yell at them.
No. Caucus is only an option for internal party business like primaries. It is not used in the general election anywhere in the US.
No. Voters always go to the polls in a general election.
I'd wager Sanders supporters are statistically more likely to be more politically active than Biden supporters making them more likely to participate in weird convoluted ways to vote.
yeah, but half of American websites don't want to comply so I have to use a VPN, it's silly. Like jeez, it's on every single website in Europe now. "What cookie settings do you want?" And sometimes these things are so buggy I can't read them after all, because I can't confirm my selection on my phone. It's pissing me off. It's not like I'm looking for things to make a bomb or something...
To be fair I'm not banned as I expected, so props to the mods. Or maybe they just havent seen it yet
Doesnt take a genius to know a thing or two about what you're voting for
He picked up all of the 5 Bloomberg supporters
Wikipedia says Bernie won 74/27.
Thanks for the clearity.
But in Washington State it’s mail in for that too
If bernouts studied what they are voting for, they would vote biden
Typo, you mean 593k.
[deleted]
Sorry I should have been more clear. She won the PRIMARY but Bernie won the caucus(which is what counted). Unfortunately the delegate totals had already been allocated https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/wash-primary1/  I was just saying that she *did* win the primary but it didn’t count.
Yes, I should have been more precise by saying “cast ballots” vs. going to the polls (which is one way to cast a ballot). The point is that no general election is decided by caucusing.
Really? Then why has biden run a limited presence campaign? The more he talks the more people dislike him. Before moderates all coalesced to stop bernie, biden was in a free fall in the polls. Then there's his record...
Ah, ok.  Very odd, but certainly answers the question!
Why did some states have both but count only one?  Politics is weird.
Right okay good point. Either way glad we are mail in especially now.
Do you have data that every time he speaks people dislike him or are you going to throw talking points you learned from some dumb fuck socialist like a good sheeple?  Why would he rally so much when he is leading the race and winning by a huge margin?   >biden was in free fall   Another talking point. Biden was leading the national polls since the election started. He dropped below bernie when Bloomberg entered the race. >moderates stopping bernie   Who would have thought calling everyone you are running against an establishment shill and shaming them based on your arbitrary purity tests would lead them to hate you and not endorse you. Even the closest candidate to bernie and who agrees with him 99% of the time didn't endorse him.
Yeah it's odd. Even though the caucuses only counted, the primary got higher turnout
Not really. The state runs the primary and that happens regardless of whether the parties use them or not. The GOP used the primary results.
It's even weirder. In Texas we had both a primary and caucus that counted for delegates in 2008. Clinton won the primary but Obama won the caucus
Calling him a socialist is all I needed to hear lmao if you dont even know definitions of ideologies why should anyone trust what you have to say on the matter  Also, warren took super pac money and backed off of m4a, while embracing wokeness and trying to smear bernie. Not an ally at all  Another thing, bernie never says the shit his supporters say, which only shows that everyone who dislikes bernie based off of some snowflakey entitlement laden sense of being offended hasn't actually looked into him at all, and has only read facebook comments. American electorate is ignorant, disengaged and unwilling to do the slightest bit of research before casting a vote- if they vote at all.
I mean it's way easier to vote by mail than waiting hours at a caucus so it's not at all surprising a primary has higher turnout.
I do know the definition. Read about democratic socialism.  >Democratic socialism is a political philosophy supporting political democracy within a socially owned economy, with a particular emphasis on workers' self-management and democratic control of economic institutions within a market socialist economy or some form of a decentralised planned socialist economy.  You are the one who doesn't understand terms.  Warren didn't back off anything. This is another purity test. Bernie Sanders took super PAC money btw. Also who gives a shit. >American electorates are ignorant   Like I said, the electores actually know the american system and how to pass policies unlike you
If YOU actually knew the terms, you would know he is no democratic socialist, as his policies more closely align with social Democracy, which is very much so still capitalist. He is essentially a moderate in better countries, that being western europe. His plan doesnt even go as far as Britain's, otherwise known as "Europe's america" for their conservatism. Meaning, hospitals would not be entirely govt owned and operated, it would merely be a single payer system towards still private hospitals.  Super pac money is bribe money. You take it, you're playing the game, and no longer representing the people, in favor of corporations. That being said, show me proof sanders took that money and I would be grateful
He literally calls himself a democratic socialist... wtf   >He is essentially a moderate in better countries   No he isn't. His M4A plan goes beyond britian and other european countries.

Another talking point from bernout without evidence. Do you just repeat what they say? see point above   > Super pac money is bribe money.

Biden Defends Archbishop Desmond Tutu and denounces Apartheid in the 1980s.
I love that Biden’s been doing the   “That’s number 1, number 2....”  for 30 years.
Yeah I saw this video recently. I remember hearing years back that he was considered to be a bit of a firebrand when he spoke.  But nowadays I think his approach is something people respond better to, although it's interesting how public perceptions change over time.
hes defiantly not racist which is pretty cool
Whenever I see a young Joe, I also see Beau.  💔
Damn, this is a good video. Biden showed a lot of passion.
But r/politics told me that Joe Biden was a segregation proponent racist
Where the hell did this Joe Biden go?  I’d love to see that fire again.  I’m used to seeing video of him being wrong for decades on things like drugs, Iraq, banking policy, etc.   I’m expecting Sanders to lose the nomination, and videos like this will help to bring folks like me (a progressive union activist) on board.
He’s always been a snack.   Yeah, I said it.
I first heard about this when people used this to claim him as a racist.  It just blew my mind, the new PC just doesn't make sense to me.
No no no....  this doesn’t fit the BernieBro narrative....   I guess I could show them this and then when they dismiss it at being old and therefore irrelevant (which I’m sure they will...) - I could say well wait? Which way does it work? We can only bring up footage that fits your confirmation bias... ?🧐
He was so well spoken, full of passion and solid argument. His anger is well focused and directed. He's got no stutter either. This 1980s Joe Biden can take on Trump in the debates. 2012 Joe Biden could do it with Paul Ryan as well. I hope our 2020 Joe Biden can pull this off. Trump and the republicans aren't going to be nice.
bUt bIdEn wAs nEvEr oN tHe rIgHt sIdE oF hIsToRy
R-politics also told me that Sanders was going to win by a landslide and revolutionize America too! How could that be a lie!
No 1 here thinks joe Biden is perfect. And he’s definitely made mistakes. Buts he’s always done what he, and the state of Delaware, believed to be best. And since he was the always poorest man in congress his entire congressional career,(yes even poorer than Bernie) he didn’t do it for personal enrichment.   Here are some things he also did that a certain group of people don’t like to think about.    -sponsored the first climate bill in 1987 back when almost no1 recognized it as an issue   -fought for gun control and against an out of control NRA(the same nra that helped Bernie get elected to Congress)  -landmark legislation in the violence against women act, significantly increasing recourse for women who were the victim of domestic abuse and sexual assault.  -helped lead the defeat of anti abortion activist judge Bork in the senate    He isn’t perfect. But neither is Bernie. Right now perfect isn’t what we need.
YUP.
Sploosh.
I mean, in this clip you see him slur some words, abandon thoughts and jump from thought to thought, and forget the name of the person he's talking to. It has nothing to do with mental acuity. Biden today is the same Biden as back then. He's not as polished as, say, Pete Buttigieg, but he's got the passion necessary.
It doesn’t matter though...Donald Trump is in office now, and we need him out. I don’t even care about the debates. All Trump does is get on stage and lie and inflate his own ego. Why should I care what he has to say in a debate? Why should I care what Fox News says? They destroyed Hillary with that email bs that means nothing now. They will stop at nothing to try to get people to vote for Trump...I’m just going to ignore the noise. I would approach any other election differently, but this election is a special case.  Biden isn’t going to be an amazing speaker, but he will help piece the country back together and will prevent more dangerous decisions from being made. Biden and Bernie would’ve both only served one term. This will be a re-building term to recover our alliances...and with the stock market as it is I guess we’ll be recovering from a recession as well which Biden has already helped us do once before. This is old hat stuff for Biden. He’s been doing this most of his life. Learning new things can get more difficult with age...doing old things that you’re an “expert” at tends to remain much more stable. Just because Joe doesn’t have the clearest diction in his speeches doesn’t mean he’s not capable and doesn’t mean the words themselves are meaningless.
Oh, he’ll stomp Trump in the debates just like he stomped Paul Ryan.  Probably even more.  Because he’s got years of experience to back him up.
He definitely has always stumbled over words. He speaks clearer when it’s from the heart vs. prepared
I heard we're bringing back BidenBro
I look forward to the return of BidenBro memes
I loved these memes in late 2016.  Made the pain a bit easier.
Honestly biden needs these. His support with young people could definitely improve and I'm sure bringing these back would help.
GOD DAMNIT LOTS  Wait, you’re not fucking Lots  WHERE IS u/Lots42 AND MY TERRIBLE YET AMAZING BIDEN BRO MEMES?
A Bernie-Obama Commercial...WTF.
I'm just riding along waiting for the Joe&Pete memes to start tbh
I, for one, approve of this blaitent karma whoring.
Unfortunately that sub is dominated by former Obama Biden fans turned Bernie bro’s who see Biden as fucking Mitch McConnell

The Onion also needs to pull its head out of Bernie‘s ass and start giving us Diamond Joe carving his initials in tables again, smoking fatties and riding loud hogs.  ETA: we should start a petition to those MFers.

I'd like to get the anti Biden crap out of this sub
I’m a 21 year old Biden supporter who still thinks that social media is “new fangled”. Maybe that has something to do with why I’m supporting Biden lol.
It might, but it's only partly his attitude towards young people that pushes us away. Most of my generation (I'm 23) don't like his policy positions. I wouldn't expect him to do much about it until maybe the general election.

Time to make a new one?
Whatever happened over there, it’s not cool. Hopefully they get on board when it’s Diamond Joe versus the dumpster fire come summer.
Nate Silver: Based on most indicators, Biden is the most popular candidate among working-class Democratic voters.
But Bernie fights for the working class or some bull like that yadda yadda
whaaaaat you mean working class voters aren't a hivemind and we aren't universally desperate to charge to the left?? shocking
Thank you for this. I am so sick and tired of reading how “billionaires and corporations” are the reason Biden is winning, and not voters like me who have to work for a living. Do I not have a voice, too?
Biden's support among the working class grew a lot yesterday
But that’s not possible because I’ve been hearing Bernie is the champion of the working class.
When I comment, I make sure to see I am not in r/politics haha.   By all definitions, I fit into what people tell me is Bernie’s demographic so it kills me when people say “the people want Bernie!!!”  Not this person.
Sanders' sycophants won't like this one
Will be very interesting to see who wins Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Penn.  I think both have appeal to working class voters.   Question. Where do we draw the line at what classified as “working class”?
Don't tell Bernie.
And among children!!!

Dude I’m so tired of the revisionist bullshit the likes of S4P and others are pushing. I saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/msmelchen/status/1234552872215490560?s=21) today from someone who dislikes sanders but hates Biden, claiming that the primary process selects the worst candidate. The actual fuck? The primary process literally selects who *the most people want* to be the candidate. Just because you don’t like the candidate doesn’t mean you get to spout off that the process is broken, it’s Democracy at work, people having their say. Joe was my second choice, but the primary process is much more than just personal choice, it’s about who can garner the largest coalition and become the most successful in making progress, even if that means putting aside your first choice. And I’m more than happy to stand behind him now.   That fact of the matter is the extremist sanders type has little appeal outside of the 18-34 bracket or so, and people can see from a mile away he’d likely lose to trump, and if he did manage to win, nothing would get done.
Bernie may spout a lot of crap against billionaires and corporations, but he sure has no problem living like one. One example is how much the guy loves to fly  ridiculously expensive Gulfstream airplanes.
Of course you have a voice! And when the Revolution comes you will be re educated all your voice can praise Dear Leader like a good subject. :-)
~~Replied to the wrong comment. Sorry.~~
He's the champion of young politically lost college aged people with no bearing on how progress is actually made and just figured out who Trotsky is or something
I think that they base it on income levels, probably. Working class is probably "Above the poverty line but less than 60K per year"
[removed]
This is why Bernie has no friends
I was going to give you a sarcastic response, but I'll take a step back and #BeLikePete.  What I think is that Donald Trump not being president is beneficial to the working class.
He was telling them that they don't need to be afraid. His policies are going to raise their taxes, but his goal isn't to upend their lives or lifestyles.  We can do good by the working class without bringing up about a huge class revolution in a span of four years.
It’s not necessarily beneficial to the working class but you miss the point that the working class is not sitting there thinking about Wall Street. They are thinking about their own interests, and those interests are not monolithic.
I mean Sanders could probably get a lot done if Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress, but thats very unlikely with him as the candidate- progressives r better off in the legislature sponsoring bills and getting them passed to the presidents desk.  With Biden down-ballot dems do very well from what i've seen

That’s some mighty fine projecting sir.

Unfortunately you seem to be an exception and not the rule on that ideology though. The quote from *Justified* rings true of /r/politics (and their subsidiaries) these days with anyone who dissents in the slightest on Bernie:  > If you run into an asshole in the morning, you ran into an asshole. If you run into assholes all day, you’re the asshole.  I voted for him in my primary, but his reddit zealots are occasionally making me have buyers remorse.
Sorry, Biden Bros? Did you just make that up?
That was my honest insight. Biden is good for the working class -- of which I am a part -- because Trump is bad for the working class. You got your answer, sorry it's not the one you wanted.
[deleted]
Interesting. I've been for Joe since he announced his candidacy. I guess I might recall its use once or twice but it sounds weird.
[deleted]
Yeah, but was Biden Bros a thing back then too? Isn't it a play on Bernie Bros?
The hatred on reddit for Democrats that do not align with Democratic Socialism disgusts me. The rest of the party matters. Stand strong, democrats!

This awful atmosphere and the key endorsements of Buttigieg and Klobuchar have gone a long way to sway their voters. It’s hard to back sanders after the way his supporters have treated all of us
I was really surprised to see Warren's Bernie-esque 'establishment' statement yesterday. She's been my top choice, though I'll vote for Joe in May when my primary rolls around and she's no longer in. Joe had an extraordinary day, demonstrating his ability to unify the party. It's **insulting** to really smart, hardworking people like Pete, Amy & Beto to dismiss their endorsements of Joe as "Washington insiders."
At this point I will only vote for Sanders to prevent Trump from getting re-elected.  It will very much be a hold my nose vote.  I really hope we can get Joe past the finish line so I won't have to worry about Sanders.
From South Bend with love, baby!
It was my best day as a Democrat in a long while. Hopefully today goes well.
It’s fun to have hope again.   But, there is still work to be done.
You are far from alone. Keep fighting the good fight!
Most Roses aren't Democrats. They're just trying to coopt the infrastructure for their own ends.
While true, let's cease and desist posting anything about what other campaigns are doing. We all know r/politics gets nutty every four years. And we're all aware of the Sanders campaign. But let's not flog a dead horse so to speak.   This sub is about Joe Biden and Friends campaign going forward. Positive attitude about our candidates success, endorsements, etc.   I say this because I've noticed a lot of new posts focusing on the hate. That is **SO** not us. Let's be the change we want to see sorta thing. Thanks!
It's mostly r/politics that operates as a shilling spot for bernie.. about half of the top post on that sub are very pro-bernie..   Anything pro-bernie is heavily up-voted to the point where you realize that its manipulated.
OP: "Proud to be a democrat"  Also OP:  ["DAE: Black people are uneducated monkeys?!?"](https://i.imgur.com/zJvyIfZ.jpg)   Democrats are being astroturfed hard people. And it's coming from all angles.
As recently as a couple days ago, I was a die hard Pete supporter. Him dropping out was, of course, crushing, but I’m glad that there seems to be a fellowship of people who share the same system of beliefs and unity
It’s so disheartening to see the 180 many Sanders supporters have done on Beto since his endorsement - like 0 respect for his opinion despite loving him yesterday morning
If you're wondering what the FBI meant by the Russians trying to sow discord, this is it. Some of the stuff that's been on the front page since December wouldn't be given the time of day in an non-election year.
Same here. I was really let down when Pete got out, but the beautiful (and yes, strategic) coming together of the party yesterday really has me on fire!
The weird part is me being perfectly fine with a lot of Sanders policies but being attacked for thinking it's more efficient to work within the existing framework rather than try to overhaul everything again. Like am I the only person that remembers how much lifting went into getting the ACA passed?
Remember there’s a pro-Bernie influence campaign from Russia gong on as we speak. Do not believe for a second that anyone on reddit (even here, even me) is an honest actor.
Can we point out that we ALL align with Democratic Socialism? That's what really pisses me off about Sanders supporters, but to an extent even some moderates. There is so much more that unites us than divides us.  We ALL want expanded healthcare. Just...Biden and moderates do not believe in going so radical with it, that even Europe would be like "yeah..um.. no thanks"  We ALL want reductions in college tuition and believe it's out of whack. It's just making outlandish promises that'll never pass the smell test helps no one.  We ALL want infrastructure reforms to boost alternative energy.  We just don't believe that somehow cutting off all natural gas consumption is realistic like flipping a light switch like Bernie believes.     Etc etc.  We all believe in Democratic Socialism. The foundations of social programs IS just this!  The problem is the term has been perverted by right minded people as Communism while those on the far left use it to try and moderate the fact that they have unrealistic radical goals.
I think we should be careful about what may seem like personal attacks on the Sanders supporters.  We'll need them if Biden wins the nomination.  There's more that unites us than divides us.  I realize people view attacks as responding in kind (and thus fair game), but we're better than that.  Besides, division is exactly what Russia wants, in general and within the Democratic Party in particular.  The most stridently anti-establishment Sanders people online may in some cases be being paid in rubles to post from Moscow, and I wouldn't be shocked if they had a few fake Biden supporters on these type of sites as well to go after Sanders people in ways intended to cause divisions that could last into the general election.  Another thing worth keeping in mind is that while we might intend a broadside at the "Bernie Bros" to be interpreted narrowly as an attack against only the folks who are sending hate emails or threats to other candidates, it's going to be *interpreted* by folks sitting at home who love Bernie because they favor Medicare to All or something but have no connection the campaign or to a few of the more toxic Internet people, as being aimed at them, and that increases Sanders' ability to push the narrative that the establishment is holding him down (A narrative that Trump has picked up on already to try to separate Sanders supporters from the eventual nominee in advance if it turns out to be Biden or anyone other than Sanders.).  I think we need to keep our eyes on the prize and make a case for our preferred candidates in a positive way.  At minimum, I would try to avoid attacking *supporters* of a candidate even if it's felt we have to go after a candidate's record, agenda, or priorities to present a clear contrast for primary voters.

You beat hate with love.   Don't need to engage fully but correct facts and kill them with kindness or just disengage.   You do need to pop echochambers though. That is why we are in this mess when narratives from social media run unopposed.
I took a look at r/politics last night and it has a strong bias towards Sanders, and a strong bias against Biden.
It was all fun and games when it was Trump but now that’s it’s “your guy”, it a problem.   Free speech for everyone!
I got yelled at for 15 minutes yesterday for saying that a 25% House Flipping Tax is bullshit.
Bernie isn't a Democrat.
Just imagine the situation if Bernie actually wins the election. There is no going back. We can undo Trump (because no one likes him), but can not undo Bernie (because his policy looks good from outside, and incentivize people not to work or generate wealth).

Former Pete supporter now on the Biden train. There was a time I was intrigued by Bernie Sanders. After watching his campaign and they way they treated the other dems - no way, Jose. Happy to be with Joe now.
How were you treated
OP: "Proud to be a democrat"  Also OP:  ["DAE: Black people are uneducated monkeys?!?"](https://i.imgur.com/zJvyIfZ.jpg)   Democrats are being astroturfed hard people. And it's coming from all angles.   Your song and dance are similar to what I’ve been spotting these last couple of weeks.
Having a man who has repeatedly called black and hispanic peoples “poor” while doing next to nothing besides swordwiggle a “I’m electable,” moniquer, while also not being willing to fix the incredible wealth desparity in this country is insulting...  I have a reason to not like the man, and why you all support him is frankly baffling to me given how the man thought he was running for senator earlier this month...

I LOLed hard at that remark of hers...  Because Pete, who's never served in Washington, is now apparently a "Washington insider". But Warren, a US Senator herself who does work in DC is apparently not a "Washington insider".  She's my senator in MA, and I feel she's really unrecognizable right now. It's bizarre. Who is giving her such *terrible* political advice. It looks like she's not even going to win MA today, her home state. Her whole campaign has been full of missed good opportunities. Trying to run exactly in Sanders lane was always going to backfire, because he always was going to ratfuck her in the end (there can only be one in that lane and I remember his 2016 antics showcasing that he isn't above ratfucking). And then while trying to be in that same lane, was totally passive about showing how she's different than Sanders. At the beginning she proudly said she's a capitalist. I thought because of that, she was going to be a top two contender come super tuesday. She could have gone that way and carved a good sweet spot away from Bernie and into the area Hillary was super successful in deciding the primaries. And then at the last 2 debates, only focused on murdering Bloomberg and not focusing on who was beating her in the MA polls....it was all *such a poor display of political instincts*.  Some people have that "thing" that makes a good executive branch candidate. And other times they instead shine better as a legislator. And there's nothing wrong with being a legislator! Look at Nancy Pelosi, trying to help stave off disaster. And she was instrumental in getting the ACA passed. She's also 2nd in line for POTUS. Being a legislator has lots of real power. I think Warren shines as a legislator, simple as that. She's one of the people to keep up being like Ted Kennedy...the "democrat lion" of the Senate. She's in Kennedy's old office... I'd love to see her as like a Senate majority leader. Be this generation's senate Kennedy. I want Warren and Kamala to be the leaders of the Senate. Least that's my two cents.
I actually laughed out loud when I saw that comment from her. On what planet is Buttigieg or Beto "Washington insiders" lmao. Warren and Sanders are literally senators. I fail to see how that's not being a washington insider.
It's sometimes sad and telling what various people do when their backs are against the wall.
Warren has disappointed me and she would have to earn my vote if someone primaried her
My view is that Senator Warren *may* be positioning herself to be a consensus nominee at a potential brokered convention.  Imagine Biden and Sanders both come into Milwaukee (Site of this summer's national convention) with substantial delegate counts under the 50% threshold.  In theory, if balloting stale mates into rounds 2, 3, 4, and beyond, the party may need to find someone acceptable to both camps with an active campaign organization and national profile who can claim to have some sort of a chance to win in November (Almost no one could do that from a standing start).    Warren is close enough to Sanders on policy that she might hold his supporters in a contested convention scenario, and is a self-declared capitalist who hasn't alienated Biden delegates enough to make her unpalatable for the majority of them if it's clear that neither Biden or Sanders will get 50%.  Imagine watching her take on Trump in debates the way she's demolished Bloomberg (I am not advocating for her- I'm voting for Biden- I'm just saying that a good case could be made that she could compete if put forward as a compromise candidate in a brokered convention *if* we got several ballots in and it became clear that the Biden and Sanders delegates were never going to vote for the other guy and needed to in order for either to get the nomination).  One might even see a strategic move by Warren delegates to vote with Sanders delegates to block Bloomberg, Buttigeg, and Klobachar delegates from putting Biden over the top, trying to force a scenario that would favor Warren eventually.  It's an unlikely scenario for several reasons- first and foremost that she won't be able to raise enough funding to stay in this race if she doesn't at least win her home state tonight and of course secondly that we haven't have a brokered convention since 1952 (Which shows you how unlikely it must be given that it's talked about every 4 years. :) ).  However, I don't see why else she'd be in the race right now.  At minimum, she must be hoping to use her delegates to influence the party platform or something.  I don't think winning the nomination by getting 50% of the delegates obtained via primaries or caucuses is realistic for her at this point in the campaign, barring a tremendous showing tonight, of course.
Same here but I hate that Bernie is driving so much division in our party. This is the perfect example of Trumpism for the Democrats.
And that's fine!  If Biden gets the nod, I will hold my nose and vote for Biden.  In the general, Democratic Solidarity is what matters.   Disregard any commenter from either side encouraging a protest vote or no vote in the general. Bad actors abound, never forget that.  Remember that a primary conservative strategy in 2016 was to discourage voting. Do not let it happen again!
I'd vote for anyone except Trump or Sanders. Both are demagogues and terrible.
I think now as well as part summer that Bernie would make the worst president of any of the democrats running with the exception of Gabbard and maybe somw of the people who dropped out way before the primaries began that i didnt look into
I honestly would rather have trump than bernie
Would you rather they divide the vote into two parties and ensure no dem or left party wins higher office again?
As AOC put it, they don't belong in our party. Of course, I'm welcoming, but if they don't want to be part of the party, then they can fuck right off.
Good call!
This is the way
Or the reddit demographic is heavily in favour of Sanders? Not everything is a conspiracy.
Lmao ridiculous. Why did u cross off his username?
Yikes, OP
Ugh.
They've done this to everyone who's dropped out and endorsed Biden (i.e....everyone)
Sanders will not get healthcare done. Obama did all the intellectual heavy lifting that Sanders is not capable of.
Fuck me, why must you people continually conflate democratic socialism with social democracy?  They aren't the same thing.  Democratic socialism means seizing the means of production and abolishing private property and enterprise.  We do not "all align" with this.  >Social democracy is a political, social and economic philosophy that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented economy.  vs  >Democratic socialism is a political philosophy supporting political democracy within a socially owned economy, with a particular emphasis on workers' self-management and democratic control of economic institutions within a market socialist economy or some form of a decentralised planned socialist economy.  Not. The. Same. Thing.
I do agree with most of your points here, but you are a little off-target with Europe not wanting Sander's Medicare For All. Most of Europe already has similar and/or more extensive healthcare plans than Medicare For All.  [This article](https://www.verywellhealth.com/difference-between-universal-coverage-and-single-payer-system-1738546#:~:text=Health%20Coverage%20Around%20the%20World&text=Today%2C%2018%20countries%20offer%20true,Switzerland%2C%20and%20the%20United%20Kingdom) goes into great detail about it.
Most of Europe is already on Bernie’s platform. Doesn’t mean it’s right, but why do you say Europe would say no to it?  Every other developed nation has single payer healthcare. A public option is just “let’s let the private insurance companies extort is just a little bit”.
Yes, tax people for making makers more efficient. That's productive!
Nice one, Bernie Bro.
Lol
Ad hominem attacks, refusing to discuss serious concerns with how Bernie's plans will get passed in good faith, ALWAYS met with a condescending tone, etc. Also, being told  afterward to ignore that shitty behavior and pay attention to the policy. The onus is on a candidate's supporters to act as good surrogates for that candidate, not on undecided voters to look past that. I'm still not 100% decided myself, but the seeming culture of "we're morally righteous, so either get on board or you clearly hate poor people" is not an attractive one. If that is the kind of movement Bernie is leading, I'm not sure I want it to be the one leading this country.
[Like this](https://i.redd.it/7dhvphwaiak41.jpg).
/u/nwordcountbot
Why are you in here brigading when it's clear you prefer a different candidate (let me guess who...)? This is why that campaign turns people away.
I see this used by Bernie supporters a lot. I think it's a wonderful way to absolve yourselves of any responsibility regarding shitty behavior. Basically, your argument is that Bernie's supporters can be super awful to people and that doesn't matter - it's on the undecided voters to look past that. The issue is that human nature doesn't work that way. If your whole candidacy is staked on a revolution and the only experience many people have with that revolution is being targeted and bullied online, they're (understandably) not going to have a positive view of that campaign. So the morally righteous argument doesn't hold much water, sorry.
Past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour.
The media and DNC has done nothing but cater to Biden despite his polling and performance but the story of course is Bernie voters are mean to us because they resent the clear bias, Hilarious!    Next time Joe lies about being arrested in support of a civil rights movement (and he will) It will entertaining watching you all everyone blink wildly while trying pretend it was just one of his many charms while not calling him on it.  Let the party pearl clutching begin when Joe continues his losing streak even with the big win in South Carolina lol.  Let's be clear trying to relive Obama through Joe Biden is pathetic and backwards thinking in it's finest

It's been super wild to see the unfolding of what turned out to be really terrible political instincts from her. I have been genuinely surprised.
Well put. I thought she was going to ride in that "progressive who favors responsible capitalism" lane, which I think she could have done well in.
> And then at the last 2 debates, only focused on murdering Bloomberg and not focusing on who was beating her in the MA polls....it was all such a poor display of political instincts.  TBF, confronting him in the 1st debate was a great decision. It set her apart and as a defender of Democrats. However, she should have let someone else take the reigns in the 2nd debate.
It just means people who aren't disliked.    Pete and Beto are liked by a lot of people and their ideas are relatively popular, that puts them on the inside compared to polarizing figures with divisive policy ideas.
Beto was a House Rep, so I can see a valid claim there, but not how spending 3 decades in DC doesn't make Bernie an insider.
Of all the candidates still in the race, Warren has the supporters who are most likely to go to sanders, so let her stay in as long as she wants lol
It absolutely is and if its Bernie v Trump it is once again the lesser of two evils.  The only reason I voted for Clinton last time.

What a shitty fucking timeline we live in.
Roses aren't liberals. They're authoritarians more likely to find common ground with MAGA than with liberals.   That's why so many Bros voted MAGA in 2016 and put Trump over the top in the Midwest, and it is why many Bros have no problem with another MAGA win in 2020 if they aren't crowned and handed absolute unquestioning dictatorial control over our party.
Because AOC is the gatekeeper that none of us asked for, but that we all need. 🤣
Thanks - I completely understand the bizarre nature of hate on social media but I've found this sub miraculously free of it.
Having dealt extensively with the moderators (been banned on multiple occasions for relatively innocent infractions) there is more going on there than nature just taking it's course.     Dark money groups like Our Revoltion can literally pay agitators, mods, whoever and we'd know nothing about it because of the Citizens United ruling they're exploiting. There's also been a lot of mod turnover resulting in homogeneous views from the plurality of mods.     I really wish reddit would just turn that into a sanders sub and create a new political default. Many of rhe alternatives that currently exist are boring or dead, so you have to go to specific candidates subreddits or something like r/neoliberal to have actually intriguing engagements.
> reddit demographic is heavily in favour of Sanders?     Probably...     But you can see how the "upvote" process is not genuine during our political process.     it was the same in 2016...  r/politics was plastered with pro bernie media and Hillary slamming...       2016 passed and r/politics went back to its normal posting or news articles about various political issues.
posterity, reddit has doxxing rules and I don't want to break that. Feel free to follow through on their account. I already have the links and screenshots for once they delete information though
I agree it's very similar. But Europe doesn't explicitly ban private insurance. In the Bernie Sanders plan, he'll basically shut down the private insurance industry in the U.S.  Beyond that not being realistic, it's something not even Europe and countries like Australia touch.   [https://www.vox.com/health-care/2019/2/12/18215430/single-payer-private-health-insurance-harris-sanders](https://www.vox.com/health-care/2019/2/12/18215430/single-payer-private-health-insurance-harris-sanders)
>Every other developed nation has single payer healthcare.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care#Funding_models  Please do a modicum of research before you vote. Multipayer and public option are very prevalent among "developed" countries.
I just posted this above, but European systems still involve the private insurance industry. If you were to listen to Bernie, he intends to shut it all down the moment he steps foot in the White House.  &#x200B;   [https://www.vox.com/health-care/2019/2/12/18215430/single-payer-private-health-insurance-harris-sanders](https://www.vox.com/health-care/2019/2/12/18215430/single-payer-private-health-insurance-harris-sanders)

>  It’s hard to back sanders after the way his supporters have treated all of us   > The onus is on a candidate's supporters to act as good surrogates for that candidate  I really, really don't think that is the point of voting for a candidate. How political debates transpire on social media is not a good indication of a politician's own demeanor or judgment, and it is definitely not an indication of their policy. You're voting for a candidate, not their supporters. I know it feels natural to want to vote (or withhold a vote) as a way of spiting a seemingly hostile demographic, as politics is inherently tribal, but that's not a very logical course of action. At least, it shouldn't be logical if you see voting as a way of enacting societal change (as opposed to something purely social).   Full disclosure: I would vote for Bernie or Warren over Biden in the primary, but I wouldn't hesitate to vote for Biden in the general, even if my progressive friends screamed obscenities at me for it. The differences among Democratic platforms are relatively nothing compared to those of a Democratic nominee vs. the current GOP platform. If we devolve into holding grudges toward candidates for what their early supporters say flippantly over social media arguments, we're doomed. That's equivalent to the red hats who remark "This is why Trump won" every time their egos are bruised, which is inane.
I'm sorry that happened to you. That is unacceptable.  I'm a Bernie supporter. I think the present state of our country is broken and needs to be radically changed and I think people have a right to be angry, but at the end of the day we're all Americans just trying to make our country a better place. You deserve better.
Thank you for the request, comrade.  ozoning has not said the N-word yet.
Lmao, ok 👍🏽  That’s in 7 years too, if you’re wondering
one person is not a brigade.
I know...after years of her showing exceptional democratic instincts.   This is why I believe her exceptional spark shines by being a senator.
She would excelled in that lane. And probably been #1 right now.  I'm not even a professional political strategist, but I could easily see how your situation would be a winning strategy. Why I'm really wondering *who* the heck is giving her such bad advice.

Very sad to see Pete go but happy to vote for Biden tomorrow!
Member of Team Pete here, still mourning, but happy to be here. Joe's a good man.
I just want to say that I'm thrilled with the lib unity I'm seeing.  Joe is a bridge builder, and it's great to see that you're taking his cues.  Thank you.
Can we please credit team Pete on the ROTR section. It was a big part of our campaign and sub so I’d love to see it credited while being spread to everyone else.
The 🎪 just got 3x bigger!
Now that's a classy move I wasn't expecting.
I’m Team Pete sashaying over to Team Joe because we’ve got work to do to save our democracy. Respect, belonging, truth, teamwork, boldness, responsibility, substance, discipline, excellence & joy is how we’re going to get this done.
Hi guys. Team Pete here. Just wanted to thank you all for adopting our mods but especially the Rules of the Road. I’m leaning Biden but not 100% yet, luckily I’ve got a few weeks before voting in GA.
Adding the ROTR is such a nice touch. So happy to support Biden with my man Pete
Just seeing the rules of the road adopted by the Joe team speaks volumes. Thanks for creating an environment that feels welcoming instead of just giving it lip service.
Yang supporter here, then Buttigieg supporter, now a proud Biden supporter!!
Can we credit Pete's campaign for the ROTR on the sidebar, please?
Thank you for being so welcoming!
Thank you for adopting ROTR. Maybe Joe will adopt some of Pete's message of belonging down the road here....
Hi guys, Just wanted to let you know I will be supporting Joe since my man Pete is no longer in the running. Will be casting my ballot tomorrow in NC!
Hi everyone, Pete supporter here! I was absolutely devastated when Pete suspended his campaign, partially because I wasn't sure I would find another environment as positive and hopeful as Team Pete. So far, Team Joe has been nothing but welcoming, and Joe himself has mentioned wanting Pete as part of his administration. I am so excited to get our guys elected!
I gotta say, I was leaning Bernie when Pete dropped, despite the attacks that we've endured.       But Joe's sincere words tonight about passing the torch put his candidacy in a whole new light for me. He has the humility to follow through with being a springboard for the new generation of Democrats like Pete. To mentor and excell their prospects so that their vision for our future has a path to reality.     And your willingness to genuinely adopt the RoTR sealed the deal for me. Very classy, very presidential.
I know most people joining this campaign are coming from Pete and Amy, but I am a Bernie supporter coming to Joe. I love Bernie and will always feel the Bern, but Joe has the momentum and the unity to defeat trump. Let’s go Joe!
Pete supporter since last March : (  Feeling gutted currently. Mod for BootEdgeEdge, Pete’s meme sub. Created one for Joe tonight that I’ll share with the group soon. r/MalarkeyBus (Need a minute to heal). There’s nothing there yet. Just got the placeholder ready.   Always had respect for Joe. Just wanted someone younger and fell in love with Pete the first time I heard him. Joe made his way to my 2nd choice after his last debate & recent talk on gun reform. I will follow Pete wherever he goes & he went to Biden, so here I am!  My candidate fell on a sword for the team as far as I’m concerned & I’ll do whatever I need to in order to make sure that was worth something.   I promise to be more uplifting in the future. Today is just too soon.
Wow I love this. Awesome to see everyone unifying like this. Just joined over from team Pete and already feel welcome here!
Big ol' Team Pete stan here, I am still in mourning. Hope to *bee like Pete* and commit to unifying the party and the nation. Lets go beat Trump!
+1 for deploying the ROTR! Let's win the era and beat Trump like a drum!!!
Adopting the Rules of the Road means a lot to us over at r/Pete_Buttigieg. Thanks, guys and gals. 🙏🏻
Oh I am so happy to see some of these Mods! Thanks for welcoming us.
Pete supporter here, not loving the options, but Biden is by far the best still around and I'll be voting for him tomorrow.
The flair options are making me emotional. Thank you for welcoming all of us. We're good folks, I promise.   Also, this thread is such a testament to what not treating your fellow competitors like garbage will do, huh? So much positivity and unity and I'm here for it. Let's do this.
Wow, seeing y’all adopt ROTR really made my night. I was already a fan of the holy trinity team up, but thanks for being so welcoming!
I love this. This subreddit has been so positive and empathetic. Great spirit.  Thanks for being so warm to us /r/Pete_Buttigieg folks
After Pete’s announcements yesterday I was reluctantly going to vote for Joe on March 10 (Michigan here). After watching Pete’s endorsement and Biden’s comments to him I can say that Biden has now won me over completely. Let’s get this done!
I was a Biden supporter before Iowa. Went to Pete. Tomorrow I vote for Joe. It was circuitous, but I found a home.
This unity rally is so damn awesome. Let's go Super Tuesday.
Hi, Pete supporter that has come on board. I am consoled in the warm welcome that we’ve received here, and the adoption of the RoTR is FANTASTIC, and inspires hope that the positivity we created on team Pete is possible here as well. Thank you again and let’s win this together.
Former Amy supporter here until this last week. Donating to Biden now
Pete supporter here.  Didn't know who to vote for tomorrow until this happened:  [https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/beau-biden-pete-buttigieg/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/beau-biden-pete-buttigieg/index.html)  "I don't think I've ever done this before, but he reminds me of my son, Beau... I know that may not mean much to most people, but to me, it's the highest compliment I can give any man or woman," - Biden
Are there any new mods that were from the original Biden team?  Also, thanks for the new flairs!
I was Yang Gang and have been waiting for someone to jump behind, Biden now has my full support.
Hi Amy people  (couldn't resist), hi Pete people.  Love all the Dem candidates this year and am sadder than I expected to be now that Pete and Amy have ended their campaigns.  I'm glad we are all rallying,  Onward Together, the way it should be done in the Democratic party.
Hi, Pete supporter here and I'm following Pete's marching orders so here I am! ;)  If I want to phone bank, but ease into it where I'm only inviting people to events (because I'm not familiar with Joe's policies yet), is there a way to do that? Oh - and how do I get a Pete Supporter for Joe flair?!
Another midwestern millenial Pete refugee here, I suppose my username isn't relevant for this year anymore, but I'm happy to be voting for Diamond Joe this St Paddy's day!  Shout out for adopting some of the mod team and ROTR. I thought that was a special part of the sub and an important facet the movement in general. I'm fired up for a tone of belonging, an inclusive victory, and No Malarkey!
Hi, I'm a Bernie supporter and voted for him in the primary.  I just wanted to say I'd be fine with Joe and will support him if he is the nominee.  I'll donate money, buy merch, make calls, send texts, whatever I can do to help.  We are all united in a common adversary and we need to Dump Trump in November.
Hi all. UT Buttigieg supporter and political junkie here, now backing Biden.  Thanks for welcoming us and embracing ROTR.
Excited to stand behind Joe. He was my original choice until I discovered Pete. It feels good to come home.
Hello! Pete supporter here! Thank you for welcoming us with open arms! It means so much right now. Let’s win this thing together!
I couldn't decide between Warren and Biden after Pete dropped out.  I ended up voting for Warren and my wife for Biden.  I originally had Biden at the bottom of my list but in the December debate (I think it was December, but might have been November) I felt he spoke to issues in a way I agreed to and had good solutions that were well reasoned.  This brought him up to number three for me and when I filled out my ballot last night (CA voter) after Pete withdrew I just didn't know who to go with.  I hope Biden keeps gaining momentum and fills his administration with educated and passionate people who can use data to bring us some great solutions that can be enacted!
Pete sent me. Donated $60 to Joe!
Here from Team Pete! It's still raw and fresh, but I'm thrilled to see Pete getting right to it and teaming up with the VP ❤
The /r/neoliberal -> Pete -> Joe pipeline is real
Was a huge day today for #TeamJoe.  So glad to have everyone on board.   Let's take back this country and restore the soul of the nation!  Go Team Joe and thank you to Team Amy, Team Pete, and Team Beto!
I'm not quite ready to say I'm Team Pete for Joe yet, even though I'm likely voting for Joe tomorrow. Joe and Pete's speech today helped a lot.   Also, very happy that this sub adopted the RotR <3
Pete person reporting for duty. Love Joe, love y'all.
5,306!!! Let's keep it up people! Warm welcomes to all.
This is really sweet. It's nice to feel included, heard, and incorporated, not just needed for votes. Thanks for that.
Wait, is the confetti tosser here? Please tell me our favorite confetti tosser is here :)
Pete refugee checking in.  I'm not 100% on board yet because I'm still a little down about Pete leaving but I'm leaning hard toward VP Biden thanks to the Pete endorsement this evening.  I vote in April and will support anyone who ends up winning the nomination.     Also thanks for adopting the ROTR.  It's a nice gesture and good grounds rules to build the broad coalition we will need to win in November.
Fellow Pete refugee here, but always been a Biden fan. Donated to his campaign a few minutes ago... let’s do this!
Another Pete refugee here.  I have tears in my eyes, but they are tears of joy after watching Biden compare Pete with his son Beau.  Joe is a man of immense integrity and has a well calibrated moral compass. I'll be proud to support him.  If flairs are being handed out, I'd love a Pete Supporter for Joe as well.
Hi. Thanks for the kind welcome.
Hope people know that while this sub isn't close to the Sanders sub, we're all scattered among different subs
Thanks for the warm welcome for everyone. Regular donator to Pete’s campaign that just donated to Biden after their speeches.
New here from the Buttigieg gang! Thanks for the welcome! Need to spruce the place up and watch it grow a bit more. Can’t wait!
I’m newbie here but it makes me very happy to see all these supporters from different candidates come together like this! It really feels like the message of unity is coming through. Welcome everyone!
Big fan of Pete here, big fan of ROTR, and big fan of the way Pete and Joe have treated each other throughout the race. I like Joe a lot and will likely vote for him when it’s my state’s turn. One thing that’d make me entirely Joe-gung-ho would be for him to own up to the Anita Hill debacle and give a meaningful apology about it publicly. He seems to deflect it when it’s come up, talking about it in only very specific ways. Any thoughts on this here? I’d like to hear him talk about it as one of his biggest regrets and ask for her forgiveness. I think this would be a meaningful step to take and I think it’d feel good to him afterward too.
former and current Pete stan here! just mailed out my WA ballet for Biden.  very excited to join this movement
Nice to be here.
So happy to see Pete's ROTR here!
I’ve been crying for the past couple of days pretty badly about Pete dropping. Not because he lost the race, but because I’m so scared to lose what has meant so much to me over the past year. Pete’s campaign is the first I’ve ever donated to, that I’ve volunteered irl for, that I’ve felt artistically inspired by and emotionally connected to. If Pete’s messaging lives on through his endorsement of Biden, I’m here to help it thrive.   please welcome me to team biden.
Rules of the road lives on! The rules of the road cannot be killed. It will always return, more disciplined and more respectful than before...   Happy to be here!
Watching at least two cultures come together is hilarious.  Pete fans: What's with the diamond and alligator? oooh I wanna say No Malarkey!  Longtime Joe fans: what's with the cat? Who is Lis? Merge the RoTR! Let's Win the Era!   Amy fans..let's bring you into this! What were your symbols and slogans?
Thanks for adopting ROTR I am hoping we could credit Pete tho. Either way I am pumped to go canvas for Biden in April when we get closer to the PA primary.
Thanks for having us! I was a Pete supporter with Biden as my second choice, so I’m excited to vote for a compassionate candidate who will put our country back on the right path.
Rules of the Road (RoTR) ❤️
The upvoting US-Flags turned me complete Biden a few hours ago.
Thank you and Welcome to all Pete and Amy supporters that came over to the Joe Biden Camp!   I was here when there were a mere 1,300 subs now were up to 5k, keep on with the Biden Surge!  We can and will do it! Vice President Biden is the one to beat Trump and get the heart and soul of our great Nation back 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  We need to keep this great vibe and excitement going!
Team Pete following my man to Team Biden. Is this the official sub for Joe?
also here from camp pete.  looking forward to working together to take our party and country back ... with dignity and respect.
EYY u/PU18 its damn good to see a familiar face.
Welp, I learned my lesson about voting too early by mailing my March 10 ballot for Pete already. But you have my support for Joe in other ways. Thank you for being so welcoming.
Been somebody who's been supporting Pete since January (quietly online but more active in real life), VP Biden's words about him and his campaign were deeply touching after his race. Can't wait to vote and throw my support for him, donating tonight.
Im in.
I was originally on the Biden train before he announced he was running, because i was hoping so much that he would run. But then Pete came along, and I just knew he was my candidate. If he can’t be the nominee this time around, I am proud to support Biden now and hope to vote for him again in November.
Yay ROTR!!  Thanks for being so welcoming ya'll! 💙💛  also, can I get a Pete supporter for Joe flair? pretty please?
I was leaning Pete, but I’m all in on Joe now. Anyone but Bernie or Bloomberg for me.
Where can i get a buttigang for biden flair?
Thanks
Can we get a subreddit specific donation tracker? Also some flairs would be nice
Welcome all, let's get moving.
How many states today can Joe afford to lose to Bernie? Yalllll I have major Super Tuesday anxiety.
Minnesota here,  waiting to vote. All the primary candidates endorsing Joe gave me hope for the first time in years.
🚂💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎 Choo choo!
I like to look at betting markets for the discussions they have, even though I don't take them very seriously. In the past few days, it has been beautiful to watch Biden's turquoise slowly spread from a handful of southern states to half of the country in  [https://www.predictit.org/](https://www.predictit.org/)
I was yuge for Bernie in 2016, and this year I was all in for Pete starting about a year ago.    If Bernie had explained to me, with evidence, why M4A is better than a public option, why his implementation would be better, why it would he smarter from a fiscal perspective, or anything like that I would have listened. The problem is that his plan is overly simplified in it's current state, it doesnt line up with what other countries have seen be successful,  and he feels no obligation to explain how it nor any of his plans will be paid for.     That lack of explanation and intellectual dishonesty with voters is what turned me off to him and drove me to Pete. Then Pete drops out, would make sense that I go back to my preference from last time, right? Wrong.    Instead of focusing on policy differences, Bernie decides to be petty and attack out in the open fundraising while collaborating with a dark money group in Our Revoltion.  He puffs his chest and claims to be more pure than everyone, while not answering the substantive questions posed to him. His supporters lash out with vitriol and hate online, and it bleeds into real life far too often in the case of how they attacked Pete. They acted like awful people, ugly on the inside and misinformed. They acted like Trump supporters.     Bernie could have had my vote back, and part of me is sad that he won't, but running a one-note campaign fueled by pettiness, misinformation, and toxic rhetoric is not going to win you any friends or influence people.     Never in a million years did I think I'd be in the diamond Joe gang, but here I fucking am.
Recent Biden supporter here. Loving the unity and inclusivity, I was very indicisive for a while but I'm feeling better and better about my choice the more I see. It's such a nice contrast to, uh, some other groups
Hello everyone!  👋🏼 Just want to thank you all again for being so inclusive and friendly. I really like Pete, was sad to see him drop out but happy he’s teamed up with Joe. Joe seems like such a decent and honest man, and his comparing Pete to Beau really made me tear up last night!
Here’s what got me: what does Joe Biden get out of running for President at this stage in his life? Hell I’m in my mid 40s and I’m already freaking tired and ready to retire if I could get away with it. I only have a granddog not any grandkids to go plant bulbs in the garden with and make sugar cookies and shit but even still I don’t see the appeal of being President at ALL, Joe sure doesn’t need the money and he can’t care about the power, the man is literally sacrificing the last peaceful years of his life to save the Democrats.
MAGA turned Yang supporter. Still waiting for Joe to confirm Yang will be in the admin.
Biden on January 29: I am concerned that the Trump‘s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic
Damn, maybe we should call him money joe because he was ON THE FUCKING MONEY
This guy got it 6 weeks early, which in epidemic time can be counted in millions of lives.
Wow, no way this is possible. I just heard from Trump that "nobody even thought about the virus a month ago." (citation: [https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-falsely-claims-nobody-ever-thought-about-virus-month-ago-n1161416](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-falsely-claims-nobody-ever-thought-about-virus-month-ago-n1161416))  Most logical explanation is that evil genius (but pretending to be senile) Biden has secretly controlled the media and got USAToday to backdate this article.
Well, he ain't wrong.
Yes, Biden is right !! And let’s face it ,we have no leader!! Call on your Senators, mayors and local officials to get Universities and research hospitals to develop and or use mass testing now!! We will be unable to control this for months on out if we do not know who has disease and who are asymptomatic carriers!!  Don’t listen to our news media outlets “ saying Covid 19 is spread all over now “ too late for testing”” the Media brought us President Trump, they will support President even as we the people are dying in the streets !!   I believe Trump has made grave and sociopathic decisions regarding this pandemic !! This President and his criminal friends are not in a position to tackle this calamity, so the next thing if we want to survive is self isolate!!  Sadly That is the only to do at this point!!  I told my whole family even if we lose our home and jobs at least we and the others around us stay safe and we are alive and did not cause a death!!   Believe me corporate America wont look out for you !! do what your gut feeling is telling you!! natural selection will take out those who just can’t or won’t .  Horrible times, i know I cry for those at the grocery stores, pharmacies ,Nurses and Doctors, at the frontline !! We must shut down everything!! Do it folks do it NOW!!
Oh you think, Joe?
Hey mods how about a new flair?   💰JOE MONEY💰
He's far from the only one to bring up this point.
*The Deep State would like to know your location*
Well, he said this in late January right... As far as I remember, not many people were talking about the possibility of an emergency/epidemic at the time since they thought that containment would prove effective and mitigate any influx of infection.  I'm glad Joe was tuned in, it's a good quality in a presidential candidate.
💎💰Diamond Joe Money 💰💎
He’s the only presidential candidate who brought it up.
*new message from Hillary Clinton*: Stay there.
Sorry; didn't see this was a quote from January.
Joe Biden is the only presidential candidate who's said that Trump's reaction to COVID has left us unprepared?
Not a problem, it's easy to miss a few words now and then.
The only one who said it in January.
Only candidate with over a 1% chance of winning, yes.
That's a different statement then. Why be disingenuous? Is this how we're going to beat Trump?
I'm quite sure that will be less than 1% when he has to square off with Trump on stage.
I would have hoped that the title of this post beginning with, “Biden on January 29” might have meant the timing was understood.   Misunderstanding insignificant details is not how we’re going to beat Trump.
> Why be disingenuous?  Why do you call a minor distinction being "disingenuous? When you asume bad faith on the part of other people as the basis for discussion, you come across as less interested in discussion and more interested in provoking people. Try to be better.
Yeah because Trump has such a way with words.
That would be why I was responding to your statement directly.
Maybe in my opinion it wasnt a minor distinction? Maybe there's a (big) difference between "never" and "not in January".
Well, he beat out the last democratic contender didnt he? You expect Joe to bumble to victory then?
He beat the most hated woman in America.  Furthermore, he lost the debates and it didn’t mean squat.  Also: Biden is far from bumbling.
Tonight in a Nutshell
Texas was the big excitement to wake up to.
What Bernie Supporters were doing last night.
But Sanders won California, which has the most delegates - arr/politics. In all seriousness congrats team Biden! I had lost hope for the election this year, but Im feeling much better about the future of this great country!
awesome!
I picked joe winning 10 states.. He got 9..   I was happy..
Now do a Joe wins California
[removed]
I'm a fan of socialist economic policies, but the people spoke clearly. Congrats on the win.
Did you just seriously re-purpose a Trump 2016 election meme? Why not make your own instead of working off of some Trumper's creativity?
A bunch sent death threats to warren (look at s4p) and complained that the establishment rigged it
He would if 72% had not voted early! Glad people are finally realizing what is at stake.

It's just a general meme.  DW, I see it everywhere.
I find it interesting how many of them are fixated on Warren's delegates, but are ignoring the fact that all of the other candidates with delegates have endorsed Biden.  So if we assume that all of warren's delegates went to Sanders, wouldn't we also assume that Bloomberg's, Buttigieg's, and Klobuchar's went to Biden?  Which would just give him an even bigger lead.
Voted early and for Joe!
One day difference and my Pete vote would have been a Biden vote.
Mega Nut
Want to win big tomorrow? Help us make calls now into Washington, Idaho, Michigan and more. Post any questions you have here.
Lots of people are afraid to phonebank because they think people are mean. Most people are nice ... or they hang up.
I am also a giant hypocrite because I call other people but I never pick up my phone. I was kind of surprised to see that lots of people pick up the phone, even when they don’t recognize the number.

I wonder how coronavirus might affect the primary. It primarily affects older people, which I worry might scare a lot of people away from voting, disproportionately Biden voters. Bernie voters are fewer in number, but they would walk across broken syringes full of AIDS if it was necessary to vote for him.
It’s actually pretty simple once you get it set up.
Been doing it and it’s much simpler than people think, sign up and take charge of this election 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I don’t think corona virus will affect tomorrow’s primary. Of the 6 states voting tomorrow, only Washington has a significant amount of coronavirus cases (only 136). If the virus does affect any state tomorrow, it’ll be Washington, but even then it won’t be significant
I'm interested in helping but yeah I've never volunteered for that...
how did you put b symbol in title?
can confirm... friends and family for Joe
he's already won 11 states! Let's win more , 😎😎😎
I signed up a week ago but never heard back
I've been Ridin with Biden since before I got my sticker.   I donated before won big and I donated what I could the day we won too.   Let's get it folks.
We should get future President Biden to do an AMA

Perhaps you may be suffering from it because I was asking a serious question.

I don't know what you mean. What's a boo vote

Saw a poll that had Biden up 24 in Michigan. Crazy. Gonna be wild to see trump vs Biden debate
Idaho isn’t a real place
Are there certain times I’m allowed to call?  I tend to stay up late.  What’s the earliest time I can call?
Get it done!   Go Joe Go!
Go Joe
I’m starting to feel bad for Sanders supporters — I pretty much agree with all of them on principle but disagree on how to get there. It’s disheartening to see how broken many of the seem.
I’m really shy but I called two numbers. The First didn’t answer. The second was an older woman who seemed upset I was calling and then said she doesn’t discuss politics with anyone. I politely said thank you and ended the call. I don’t think phone calling is for me. I need something different.
What to do when you get a voicemail? I just left short messages reminding them to vote. But the app doesn't say.
IT BAFFLES ME THAT PEOPLE DO THIS
You can either do a training or join the slack and read PDFs.
"Make sure other candidates hate you so much that the won't vote for yours?" Nice try troll, go back to worshipping the monstrous practices of the NCAA on cult college athletic page.
Yup. That’s definitely a worry. One more reason to call people. I’ve talked to a few Biden supporters who thought it was going to cut social security because Bernie said so. People have all kinds of worried about voting and who to vote for.
Washington votes by mail only. Ballots have already arrived, and Covid-19 isn't bad enough that people can't make it to a mailbox.
I can send you the link.
you literally just sign up and start making calls
It sounds like you might be suffering from some kind of comprehension issue. Maybe check with your doctor?
> making on life TV.   On "life" tv? Surely it was a mistake. What's the deal with that?
He’s got a stutter. I know that Bernie people are salty right now but attacking people for well documented disabilities that they have had from childhood doesn’t make you look better.
You guys couldn't even win the primary. How are you going to win the general?  Hillary beat Bernie too. She was the better candidate and she beat your boy, just like Joe. Get a better candidate.
LOL, don’t boo vote. 👻
It was Obama’s advice to young people seeking change. Get off the internet and organize yourselves. Stop blaming other people when you don’t vote.
OK Trump Supporter
Nope. Obama has the highest turnout among younger voters in modern history. Much much better than Bernie.
9:00 to 9:00 in the time zone you are calling.
There is also a texting app.
It can be a little awkward. I focus on the idea of getting the data and try to be nice but don’t worry too much about it.
You can leave short messages asking for their vote.
Ok, zoomer ;)
Can you clarify Joe's position on Social Security? I saw a video of him talking about cutting but have also heard talk of expanding it? So hard to get a clear understanding on policy with all the misinformation...
Ah I see. Thanks for the info
I wasn’t aware of said documented disabilities, which is why I asked the question above. Thanks for the answer, but it woulda been better if you put that the first time.
I haven’t heard about the texting app but I would prefer it
idk what that means. I'm 35, does that mean I'm too old or too young? fuck. Am I just an idiot? Also possible lol
He has said that he will protect and expand it. The fake video that Sanders made was of him debating Paul Ryan and saying that it shouldn’t be cut. Bernie’s team cut out words so it sounded like he was saying the opposite. They have done that at least five times this year.
I checked your post history. You have no idea how many Sanders supporters come over here every day ranting about people with disabilities and how they shouldn’t be allowed to participate in society.
It would have been better if you didn't imply that people with speech disorders are stupid and incompetent. It's really hateful and cruel. I have never heard so much cruelty.  As someone who struggled with a speech impediment as a child and who managed to do well in life later, I really wish that you wouldn't jump to conclusions about us and make hateful statements. We don't owe you anything.

Bad joke on my part. Zoomer = young version of Boomer. Just trying to get people to answer their damn phones lol
Gotcha! Thanks for the reply!
I wasn’t trying to convey any salt in my question. And if by my post history you noticed a picture of Bernie, that’s because I came across that on a meme page that used to be funny but now just posts shitty right wing meme attempts, which is why that was on r/therightcantmeme
You must have me mistaken, because not once did I imply that people with speech disorders are stupid and incompetent.
Thanks!
LOL I reflexively avoid it because for so many years the only people who called me were debt collectors... even my parents texted or emailed me lol

Okay, you are also referencing a bunch of videos about Biden that Bernie made, which are mostly doctored and some of them show him stuttering.   I feel like the Biden and Warren supporters and others on here have explained to Bernie supporters at length that it's not okay to make hateful statements and that you just keep doing it. I myself have explained that racism is bad and sexism is bad and discrimination against people with disabilities is bad at least 25 times a day to Bernie supporters and you guys just keep doing it. I don't think understanding that discrimination is bad is that hard. Just don't assume that people who are different than you are inferior and you will have an easier time of it.
You should read your own posts.
It's time.
Welcome
Welcome from a Warren Democrat. It’s a tough thing to take the L and jump on another train. I had to do that a couple weeks ago and it wasn’t easy.  Much respect.  I think you’ll see that Biden is a bit more progressive than he’s been cast. And he’s shown a willingness to listen, learn, and adapt. That gives me comfort. I hope it will for you, too.  Whatever the case may be, we need to all be on the same team if we are going to defeat the march of fascism in this country that a second Trump term threatens. Solidarity in that fight is important.  We can push Biden on the progressive agenda within the growing tent now. It seems to be working already.
 Welcome! https://joebiden.com/ is Joe’s website. You can sign up to call or text bank there as well as donate.
Welcome brother. Neither one of us will have our original candidate choice become the nominee, but for the sake of the country, we’re all in for the one who did.
Welcome from Team Pete! Spread the word! :)
Welcome.  We came from every Democratic campaign, but we are united in the goal of kicking Trump to the curb.  Go to the website.  Sign up.  Then it's donations, door knocking, and phone calls.
Bernie Brothers may not like it, but this is the ideal Bernie supporter.
Welcome, help us bring the rest of the Sanders camp into the fold. The only way we win in 2020 is by uniting. If we are divided come November, we will have four more years of this...
Greetings and welcome!
Welcome to the club
Welcome!
welcome, friend. Let's kick Trump's ass together.
Same here. I started out supporting Bernie, but now that his path to the nomination is finished, it's clear that there are more pressing issues: The issue of defeating Trump.
Welcome Bernie supporters!  Let's UNITE and defeat that insane monster Donald Trump in November!!!  Keep bringing people in!!
Welcome
Welcome friend! We have fun here and we’re excited to have you!
Welcome!
I love you. Just sayin’.
Glad to have you!
Welcome !
>I live in Tennessee, so there's not much i can do to sway the vote here  Joe isn't the only one running in November, down ballot Democrats need help too.  Just remember Tennessee use to have Al Gore as it's Senator, we need to work on getting  states back into the hands of Democrats over the long term, and we do that by getting them to win county, and state legislatures seats first.
Yep, I voted for Bernie in Texas too. Was truly hopeful he would excite the younger voters, but didn’t turn out like I was hoping. All in for Joe, now, hoping for a return to some sense of normalcy, and allowing RBG to retire next term when she’s ready. Joe will be a step in the right direction, if nothing else.
Thanks for joining. I'm an old Warren supporter helping out. Even if TN goes red in the presidential election, there is a lot of work to be done locally or regionally. Don't forget about down ballot races that can swing the House, Senate, or local government. The more blue in areas in TN (some of my family is near Loudon County) is a plus.
Honestly? Look at his website. Read through his platform on a lot of issues. Take note of things that surprised you, and talk about *those* things. You'll find a lot of policies that you'd have no idea Biden supported if you've been stuck in an environment that screams "He's basically a republican" in your ear constantly.  For starters:  * Universal healthcare via expanding free access to government-funded healthcare  * Federal decriminalization of marijuana for all purposes, federal legalization for medical purposes, rescheduling for research purposes, encouraging states to fully legalize if wanted  * $15 federal minimum wage  * Eliminating private prisons  * Eliminating mandatory minimum sentences, and any jail time for drug use  * Ending cash bail  * Pro-nuclear energy with a plan for net-zero emissions by 2050  The biggest lie out there about Joe Biden right now is that he's going to be "more of the same" or "status quo", when in actual reality, this is the most progressive platform from a presidential nominee, ever. Talk about that stuff.
You can sign up to phone or text bank on Joe's website--looks like someone linked it above.  :)  I've done both several times now.  I spent about three hours texting Illinois and Arizona voters yesterday!  Welcome aboard.
Glad you’re here! Let’s go save democracy!  On top of phone banking (or instead of it) is it possible for you to knock doors in a battleground state? Are you close to any populated areas in North Carolina or Ohio or Texas?
Blue is blue. Orange is orange.
I voted for Bernie in 2016 and I was planning on it for 2020. I’ve been convinced that we need Joe Biden. My concern is not only defeating Trump but just returning to some normalcy. All I want in my president is someone who is intelligent, calm, a leader, someone with experience and most importantly, someone who truly cares about all of us. That’s Joe Biden. He wasn’t always in the right but he is now and that’s what matters. Go Joe!
Welcome.
Checking in from Team Pete. We are going to need all of Bernies supporters enthusiasm, passion, and energy that we can get. Thank you so much for coming to visit here. What I would say we need from you is help reaching out to other sanders supporters and helping us convince them that while their candidate may not have won, we all have a common enemy in trump. Most of us don’t have “our guy” in it anymore, but we know the existential threat that 4 more years of trump poses. As someone who understands your fellow Bernie fans, help Joes message reach them now.
Here’s some ideas to help:  - Start a Democratic or progressive group in your area or join one  - Help register young people for the fall. (Tennessee has one of the earliest voter registration deadlines and lots of people don’t know about it.)  - if you want, join the Biden campaign or a local campaign that won the primary and get some campaign experience. Even if it’s not your favorite candidate, the mechanics of campaigning are similar and you can learn skills for future campaigns.  - encourage people to vote in the fall and find reasons and issues that matter to younger people locally. One problem with politics today is that it’s so focused on the president that people feel powerless even when they can impact local elections more. The VoteBlue subreddit has lots of ideas and info for that.  Whatever you are doing doesn’t have to be pro-Biden or pro-Boomer or whatever. Get out and advocate for student loan forgiveness and free college and universal healthcare. Promote Biden when he agrees with you and disagree with him when you disagree with him.  Keep that sticker on your laptop and wear your Bernie gear when you register voters! The future of the Democratic Party so with you.
> take the L and jump on another train.  I read that as like taking the Chicago L lol.
I was so impressed my his speech yesterday. That's what leadership sounds like!
As a person typing on a laptop with Pete stickers on it, welcome as well.
Probably still going to need to do a lot of convincing to get those independent voters Bernie had.  They're the type to value principle rather than the lesser evil.
Is this what peak performance looks like?
Hey, another Bernie supporter here too! I've actually gone from Pete - Yang - Bernie - Biden so I've had my share of switching campaigns lmao. I will GLADLY vote Biden over our current Fuck Face-in-Chief any day of the week.
Oh? ;)
I hear you! God... seems crazy that in 20 years we went from Al Gore to Blackburn and Alexander. I specifically live in east Tennessee, where i drive by an anti abortion sign every day. Middle and west tennessee still have hope!!
Less progressive is better than anti progressive
Blue no matter who.
People are forgetting that the "status quo" is a president who grabs women by the pussy. Joe couldn't be further from the status quo!
I live about 2 hours from Asheville, NC!
And we will get 4 more years of Trump with a mild offering like Biden.  That's why so many are Bernie or Bust.  I am yet to be convinced otherwise considering Biden's desire to keep things the same.
I love that team Pete has been so forward in supporting the front runner for the Democratic party. Solidarity 🤜🤛  Saying this as a Betomaniac.
If principles like getting kids out of cages and taking actionable steps against climate change don’t do anything for them, it’s hard to know where to go
Perfect! In either September or October, spend a couple Saturdays knocking on doors there! You'll find that in-person canvassing is usually much more effective than phone calls. (caveat: social distancing protocols may make people more hesitant to answer the door for strangers in campaign shirts, so be on alert)
😎🍦lol k
I don't think you fully understand the meaning of principles.  Bernie's millions of independent voters believe in the general common good and that's helping everyone live a better life period. This already includes immigrant kids at the border... and a nearly 17 trillion new green deal compared to Biden's 1 trillion.   You're absolutely right, I don't think it's hard to know at all where their votes will be going. We know they'll vote for Bernie regardless even if he's not the nominee. Why? Because Biden has very little of the principles Bernie runs on and that’s helping everyone live a better life period, not just kids at the border who shouldn’t be in cages to begin with or the greatest threat to the US being climate change but only spending a trillion on it.  Biden will likely lose without these independents. If Biden wants to win he needs to start thinking about how he's going to win these voters. They want to change and Biden is offering very little of that. Honestly, at this point, progressives are basically an entirely different party of their own and would rather see the DNC/Biden lose than reinforce the status quo for another 4 years.
I think a lot of progressives, while not thrilled about Biden, will happily vote for him, myself included.  I think those that won’t are more of the contrarian, independent type who may have voted for Trump last election because they wanted an outsider, didn’t matter the politics. Plus the extreme left wing of the party.  But Biden will definitely capture some moderate conservatives who dislike Trump but never would have voted for Bernie, and I think that type is much more common.
I disagree. The path to election isn't to pander to those who'd write in Bernie in the GE. The path to being elected sits on moderate never Trumper Republicans and independents. And you won't get those by making big promises, being hyperpartisan and alienating people.   And if those "progressives" would rather have four more years of Trump than Joe, they can't call themselves progressives anymore. If you pick regress over slight progress, you're entiteled and probabaly not even a progressive for the betterment of the country but personal gains.
Exactly! Biden needs some of the moderate GOP vote and LOTs of the Bernie vote.  Exit polls showed that 80% to 90% of Bernie voters were already convinced to vote for Biden in the general When they voted  so there are *way* more Bernie voters who will vote for Biden then there are Republicans.  A lot of Bernie supporters on Reddit are extremists. Most Bernie voters are not. Most of them are already reluctantly ready to support Biden and lots more will come around by November.
> And if those "progressives" would rather have four more years of Trump than Joe, they can't call themselves progressives anymore.  I’d call them left-leaning populists.
I agree. It gets to the point where some people seem to just really want to feel relevant. They think they can hold the election hostage because their candidate didn't win the nomination. I'm getting whiplash watching the transitions from "basic rights for everyone" to "fuck poor people and women". Maybe part of the reason the movement isn't catching momentum is that they do a ideological 180 whenever they're questioned? (And by "they" I mean the entitled white males, I know the majority of Bernie supporters are NOT like that)
They are the minority in real life even if there are a lot of then on Reddit.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker endorses Joe Biden
Unironically a billionaire. And a damn good governor.
Surprised he hadn’t done this already, honestly.
I live in southern IL but had no idea who my governor was until my mom came home cursing this guy for shutting down all restaurants in IL because she things the virus is overblown
I really disliked Pritzker getting elected, so much so that I ended up voting 3rd party, but he has impressed me with his leadership skills. This is another win for Joe.
Pritzker gave off a bit of a slimeball vibe to me during his campaign, but I’m happy to say I couldn’t have been more wrong about the man. What a great governor he’s been for that state.
One of the best young Governors in the country, and a future star of the party for sure.
When he said "The federal government needs to get its shit together. NOW." He meant it!
He’s already doing more than Rauner or Blago would’ve done during this crisis.
Idk man. Illinois and “good governor” don't go well together in a sentence.
Speaking from an Illinois resident it is about god damn time we have a governor who actually cares about its citizens and has the nuts to enforce policies
Bu- bu- I was told all billionaires are bad!!!
one upside to billionaire politicians (assuming they are morally good) is that they're mostly immune to special interest money
His response to Trump’s malarkey the other night was everything:  https://twitter.com/govpritzker/status/1239021033191018497?s=21  This is one vote I don’t think I will ever regret. He has been wonderful, informative and *there* during the entire COVID-19 crisis so far. He has helped calm my nerves knowing that Illinois’ local government is competent, at the very least.
Kinda cool he did it after getting good press the last few days after railing against the Trump admin.
He’s just trying to protect people like your mom from getting sick.
That's the weird thing about governing a state like Illinois, where something like 2/3 of the state's population is in a six-county area in the northeast corner of the state. You then have a few smaller metro areas in the central state (Peoria, Springfield, Cham-bana, etc.), but the southern third is either totally small-town/rural, or much more connected with St. Louis.
How was Quinn? I keep hearing him referred to as "the forgotten one". If he lost to Rauner - even in 2014 - he couldn't have been all that amazing.
First time for everything
lol, he's the exception to the rule in IL.
You’re right lol but he’s actually been pretty good so far? But I don’t know if the governor’s mansion attracts crooks or turns people into crooks🤔. Only time will tell.
It helps the expectations are so low after the last two (not counting Quinn.)
Every billionaire is literally the devil
Governor Teddy Bear
True. As an Illinois resident myself, he’s gained a lot of support from me these last couple days.
I've never heard of Urbana-Champaign referred to as Cham-bana and I'm now going to only refer to it as that so thank you
Yea everyone from around where I am identifies more with STL than anything else
Ok I guess. Probably unforgettable lol. I was living in another state for college during his run so I didn’t pay much attention unfortunately. Illinois has never had great leadership. we are taxed for everything- I’m surprised there’s no breathable air tax - and we are still in a huge deficit. No clue where my money goes.
I don't think Quinn ever really wanted to be governor - Blagojevich tagged him as Lt. Gov. to basically be his Mike Pence; someone much less corrupt in case shit went down. Before that, Quinn was better known as a public advocate for things like utility prices. Good guy, ineffective governor.
Quinn was terrible. He is the reason we ended up with Rauner.
Quinn was Lt gov to blagojevich.  I think that was the main reason he lost.  Blag just got a pardon from trump
By our standards, not going to prison makes you among the best governors.
Smh why haven't we crusified all the billionaires yet...
It's just down the road from Blormal
But Bruce Rauner never went to prison and he was a meh governor at best?
As someone who went school in Bloomington, we call it Blo-No
I went to school in both areas, so this is a fascinating exchange (but, you are right about blo-no).
yeah i've heard that one too.  I lived there from about 2003-07. Had my bachelor party at Circle Lanes, Ozark House, and Kappa Kabanna, and stayed at that Holiday Inn on the north end of Normal. I think KK is the only one of those still open?
Biden spent $4,000 on advertising in California and still gets 24%
And a good chunk of the vote (at least 40% I think) came from early voting so a lot of people voted before Joe’s current momentum started.
Biden: $4k  Bernie: $7M  Bloomberg: $71M
People ignore how much Bernie buys his votes.
Essentially Biden had gained 2 voters per 1 cent spent in California.
Biden took money out of politics, mainly because the establishment was ready to toss him to the curb three days ago.
Most people probably won't care about this, but it's important to me that people pay their staff fair wages.   [Biden's largest expense is his staff's salaries at 35%](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/expenditures?id=N00001669)   [Sander's largest expensive is Media, at 30%. His salary expense is 26.9%](https://www.opensecrets.org/2020-presidential-race/expenditures?id=N00000528)   I really appreciate a candidate who prioritizes paying his staff first.
I was just praying he was viable (15%) cuz 538 was not his friend leading up the vote.
Who needs money and organizing when you have *Joementum*
Name recognition and common sense is an incredible asset.
Can someone explain to me why Biden didn't seem to spend much time or money in the ST states? I'm thrilled he did so well, but why was he so absent from those states?
I hope Biden’s campaign can get better for the general tbh
Crazy now its beneficial to Joe if Bloomberg gets to 15%
What a night! Thank you all!
I was one of the CA votes for Joe. Strong showing and really shows that money (Bloomberg) cannot buy CA.
Sanders lead will go down another couple percentage points. His lead will probably be around 5%. Give or take 1%.
Who watches ads anymore? I seriously haven’t seen a ad in years with DVR and streaming services.
Unbelievable
So he is doing better than expected in California?   Imagine if Kamala joined Beto, Pete and Amy Monday night
Truly amazing what the American voter is saying right now, given Joe hasn’t spent a fraction of what Sanders has spent. Joe reminds us it’s up to all of us. No hero bullshit or king worship like 45. Democracy and fight for the soul of this nation is on all of us. Go Joe and go America!!
I am a registered republican but I don't like Trump so Biden I can support but Bernie is a bit much for me.
Left-leaning democrats : Get money out out of politics!(Not that i disagree, btw) Joe : Ok.
My small, four-person small business spends more money than that per month on digital ads. That's nothing. Holy cow.
This is how you get money out of politics...
Wow, total annihilation. I'm so relieved that America won't be going down the same Socialism street that has killed countless millions.
Don’t need to spend money on ads when you get hundreds of millions of dollars in free, positive media coverage.
I literally only saw one Biden commercial this cycle and it was on Monday night.
https://youtu.be/DwXweiRjckI
Practically at 25% now.
Thrifty Joe!
It’s because Pete was hovering near viability in CA.
I’m just glad I never have to see another Mike Will Get it Done ad.
Biden had eight years of free and positive advertising from 2008-2016.
How much did super pacs spend?
This is an important point. It will take a while to count the vote. There were a couple million early votes. That's mostly what has been reported. A lot of us held on to our ballots until yesterday and were able to switch from Pete, or Amy, or Tom. I still think Bernie will "win" Ca, but it's going to be closer.
I’m one of those votes. Absentee ballot for Pete that would have been a Joe if I voted yesterday. And there were a lot of us. Maybe enough to give him the state if we voted later.
Bloomberg:  $173 per vote  Sanders: $7.77 per vote  Biden: $0.006 per vote.  Now, if Bloomberg spent $77 million on ads for Joe, by my calculations, Joe would have won 12 billion, 833 million votes in California.
Please, all ya'll talented people, please start making info graphics on the spending.       Biden is about to be hit **hard** about having billionaires funding his campaign, we need shareable info graphics that highlight how **little** Joe spent on these ST states compared to Bernie.
Including with all the "free" shit he offers to his voters.
How does he buy his votes ? Most of his campaign contributions are from MILLIONS of Americans donating their own money. I am sure most of the people who have donated to him are going to vote for him. So how does he "buy his votes" ?
Someone who's that efficient with money should probably have a really important job!
I wonder how much of Sanders' "media" expenditures include social media manipulation...?
538 didn't account for Joementum.
and carefully cultivated relationships
And a decades long career of helping people.
Joe keeping his powder dry for the General.
[deleted]
They had no money-- they're gonna have it now!
Hopefully saving up cash for the general. Hopefully everyone starts injecting cash into Biden and down ballot Dem’s campaign.
They need to hire those geniuses who helped win Iowa and almost won NH. That will help A LOT.
Older people who still religiously watch television and the news, I'm guessing? Also the same old people who actually show up to vote in large numbers.
Biden is doing basically exactly how he was predicted to, less than 9% behind Sanders. Bloomberg however is majorly underperforming and likely won't be viable statewide to Biden's advantage
Even if Bernie became president (and I think he's in reality much further left than he and his more moderate proponents are inclined to admit), this was never going to happen.  Most likely case was a Carteresque mess.
Nah, don't fear monger.
Big if true.
TheyDidTheMath
Biden has the type of broad support that money just can't buy.
3750% Margin of victory is something that not even Putin could pull off!
We’ll work on something.
I know that’s more a criticism of his messaging, but that “free shit” sounds pretty close to denigrating the real anxieties and needs of the poor. Bernie is tapping into something real and Biden needs to step up to the plate to speak on it too.
I'ts not free shit. It's a way of life that can sustain the majority who are in poverty, or uninsured, or homeless, or just struggling in any way. It is not free shit if it is paid for.
You buy vote by spending money on ads. Only couple of million people have donated to bernie but a lot more will vote for him. Money does buy votes, but it is not the only thing.
It’s all spending on ads asking for more money.
and people feeling the Cly-burn
Well that explains the ads, but is that the reason he didn't travel there as well?  Now I feel bad for waiting so long to donate. I had been waiting for him to be the nominee, but after lost big in IA and dropped in the polls I knew Biden was in trouble, and I donated immediately after his win in SC.
Yep, they were being wise with where they put their resources.
Agreed on this: it also sounds too much like the sort of line the republican party has used for decades to refer to pretty much any social safety net.
Yes, but it’s hinting at something real. His spending proposals are so ridiculous that a lot of middle class and upper middle class folks can look at them and think that they’ll better better off with Bernie in charge.   Only issue is they’ll never be feasible without reducing the well being of the middle class in some other ways (Taxes, deficit, broken promises, or tanking the economy through capital flight).
For us to read all over Reddit, despite the fact that we prefer another candidate.
He spent his time in the first 4 states.
I'm voting Blue No Matter Who (although I strongly dislike Bernie). I suspect many people (like myself) wanted to be sure Biden survived Super Tuesday and actually was viable before committing money to his campaign.  The real fight is in the general election against Trump, and the Democrats absolutely must win this. Now that he clearly is the frontrunner, I'll be donating to Biden as much as I can spare.
He traveled there strategically. Like he wasn't in VA every other weekend, but last fall when we had elections for off-year state legislatures, he was there rallying support. People remember that, and they appreciate that and it paid off clearly by how large of a margin he won Virginia by. Biden was here, Bernie was not.
His time was already maxed out in other states - it was a strategic gamble, and it paid off big time.
[deleted]
Yup.  I'm always hesitant to donate in primaries because I care way more about the general and feel like it's burning money to donate to the loser.  If the candidate loses the general, fine: I'll go down swinging, but not against other democrats.  My vote was always going to be for whoever was polling better in swing states because getting Trump, Barr, and Miller out dwarfs any policy concerns; Biden and Bernie weren't polling that differently, but I like Biden a lot more and now that he's the frontrunner without burning a ton of money attacking other democrats, I'm comfortable setting up a recurring contribution.
Well whatever he did it worked like a charm
Yeah he had good nationwide polling. He just needed to stem the bleeding caused by low placings in early contests. Getting 2nd in Nevada accomplished that.
They'll call it the Clyburn gambit
Forgot where I found this, but credit to the OP.
Hey! Pete beat him in Iowa lol
I'm almost certain this originated in the Neoliberal subreddit.
So, Biden will defeat Sanders in the primaries, but will destroy the world afterwards while Buttigieg will be the president of the remaining handful of people before Thanos shows up to kill them in the next movie?
Why did the Bernie camp feel that they are entitled to win. They won 2 out of 4 and all of a sudden they think they are the voice of people, the unstoppable candidate? What was that about, he barely edge out Pete in N.H. And there are a lot more moderate candidates in the competition to divide the support!

Yah!!!
Beat him in Iowa, tied in New Hampshire.

Nate Silver on Twitter: Per our poll with Ipsos, Democratic voters rated Biden's debate performance more highly than Sanders's.
[Key points:](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-sanders-debate-poll/)  * The debate doesn’t seem to have been much of a game-changer. * Biden picked up a little over 3 points in potential support while Sanders experienced a 2 point decrease, but neither change was particularly big, unlike some of the gains and drops we saw in previous debates. * Going into the debate, voters thought Biden was the most likely to win in the general election. That was true after the debate as well.
The [wrap-it-up box](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-GCLDpvGStw/maxresdefault.jpg) in the comments cracked me up.
tfw you spend a month telling everyone Biden has dementia then your candidate loses a debate to him.
But did you take into account that they are low info shills? You have to take like 50 points away for each of those and you see Biden is worse than Trump.  /s
Because Biden actually addressed the issues at hand while Sanders always reverted to attacks or his two talking points of "corporations are bad" and "why are we the only nation that doesn't provide healthcare" while not actually answering the question.
Sanders needed to crush Biden in this debate to get anything out of it, which clearly didn’t happen either way.

What is that from? It looks like Guillermo from Weeds.
It's almost like the Bernie bros spreading Russian smears were unwittingly setting themselves up for disappointment. *You hate to see it!*
I think he said no fracking on Federal Lands?
Chapelle's Show
I think it is him lol
Jesus, not everything negative is Russian smear...
Ah 2003.
I've been around this shit for a long while, even was on the mod team of r/EnoughTrumpSpam since they went to "war" with The_Donald and admins censored ETS. I can tell 2 things are definitely being pushed:  1. "Biden has dementia"   1. Bernie or Bust movement   Again, I'm not saying it originates from Moscow, just saying it clearly fits their cyber ops disinformation agenda. They are here. This has been proven by both federal agencies and admitted to by Reddit administrators. We just don't know how widespread it is.

It's more than a "feeling": filed under *national security* - [Bernie Sanders briefed by U.S. officials that Russia is trying to help his presidential campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/bernie-sanders-briefed-by-us-officials-that-russia-is-trying-to-help-his-presidential-campaign/2020/02/21/5ad396a6-54bd-11ea-929a-64efa7482a77_story.html)  Worth reiterating: Bernie isn't a bad person. But the flames amongst his die-hard, cult of personality fans are being fanned.
[deleted]
TYT and The Hill are what I call the "Purity Test Left." They are bad faith actors using intellectually dishonest rhetoric to gain a modicum of power. They reject any progressive idea if it didn't come from their cult leader. In this case Sanders. The attacks on Yang once he did what he said he would do (support the nominee) were particularly vicious. The attacks on Warren were incredible. The smug entitlement they project because they have a couple hundred thousand views on "The YouTube" is disturbing.   Fortunately, voters are rejecting these sycophants. Just look to Cenk Uygur's congressional campaign. An absolute disaster. Even Bernie withdrew his endorsement because of Cenk's hideous reputation.  Krystal Ball is being called out for using populism to pander while forming a PAC funded by a billionaire. And regular voters are rejecting Kyle Kulinski calling everyone who didn't vote the way he did "normie democrats" or "low information" voters.   There is a vacuum on the left that needs to be filled with good faith actors. Populism is a fine ideology to start, but co-oping populism to run hate campaigns will only set the movement back decades.
Populism has an odd penchant for morphing into hideous final forms.

Yang is good people
Damn Yang is really pushing hard against Bernie lately
I wish CNN would stream his segments somewhere.
I think my preferred Biden-led ticket would be with Andrew Yang. I think they would complement each other very well.
Joe's heart and humanity is why he's always been my favorite politician. I'm for Warren now, but she'll drop out next week, I think, and then I'm all in for Joe. She and Joe are the only ones in this thing that can actually accomplish something. Joe's probably the only one who can actually beat trump at the voting booth.
Wow, thanks Yang. Those are supportive words.
I've always liked that Yang fellow. I think his ideas need a bit more time to percolate, but he brought a new welcome perspective to the race.
How have you say someone has caring and empathy if they do not support public healthcare?
Yes he is !
I think Yang really became disillusioned with Bernie when he realized how much of an anti-intellectual Bernie is.
"anger & revolution" isn't necessarily a negative characterization for bernie.
What else has he said?
[Here you are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb_3Og7XlLs)  That channel tends to post his full segments
Me too. Biden 2020 would restore this country and get it going in the right direction. Yang will help biden with the tech side of policies, and the economics of it  Then yang 2024, where he can boost the country into the future after a strong biden leadership
Do you think Yang UBI thing would prevent people from voting blue?
Beto has been working his literal ass off helping down ballot races. Pretty unfair to attack him tbh, considering how important those races are.
Me too. I think  2024/2028 will be the time to adopt his policies. Maybe a biden 2020 with a yang vp, then yang 2024?
Ya he has a plan for how to pay for none it what he's promising! Pie in the sky promises!
He really should have said hatred instead of anger, and sedition instead of revolution.  His movement really sunk from "hey let's shake up the status quo" to "the whole system is rigged against me!"
Maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but you may have heard a lot about his 160+ policies, but maybe not how he threaded them together into policy "whitepapers": https://yang2020.com/blog/category/policy
Thank you!
Source?
I think he's being the same as he always has been, and everyone who wasn't apart of his campaign just started listening.
Maybe try looking on his website. Big brain genius you are.
It is rigged against him but mostly because a ton of people don’t agree with him, especially those in power
I am on his email list and they have been emailing and texting me for three months. https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2020/1/21/1912269/-Beto-O-Rourke-s-Powered-by-People-Knocks-25K-Doors-for-Eliz-Markowitz-s-Special-Election-Runoff  Edit: also if you follow his Facebook page he updates it regularly with videos https://m.facebook.com/betoorourke/
Thank you. I’m happy to see this. I always got a celebrity vibe from him but clearly he cares about the whole party. Please accept my apology.
No worries. He was my first choice because I believe he truly cares about people and the future of our country. I believe the media’s “celebrity” spin was the downfall of his campaign, which sucks because that’s not at all who he is. I really hope he can help make Texas blue!
Me too. And your prolly right about media spin!
Joe Biden maintains lead over Bernie Sanders in Friday ballot counts in Washington primary
> Former Vice President Joe Biden maintained a lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a count of ballots Friday in Washington’s presidential primary. >  > As of Friday evening, Biden led with nearly 38% of the statewide vote, compared to about 36% for Sanders. >  >     Candidate | # votes | % ---|---|---- Biden | 544,978 | 37.70% (38%) Sanders | 515,411 | 35.65% (36%)  Current vote spread: 29,567  Current spread: **Biden +2.05**  Results from the WA SOS site:  * https://results.vote.wa.gov/results/20200310/President-Democratic-Party.html  *WA SOS site timestamp: Last updated on 03/13/2020 5:45 PM*  Biden flipped Pacific, Skagit, and Chelan Counties.   There's a chance Biden might flip Grant and Adams Counties. The difference in votes in Grant County is 9 votes and in Adams County it's 4 votes.
This primary is all but a waste of time at this point.   Can we end this and focus on the main election already?
if he sweeps on tuesday again, i think bern will finally be burnt
I’ve seen enough
My ballot was finally counted for Joe on Friday :)
Bernie needs to concede. He's only helping Trump and helping covid 19 spread.
Let's go Pacific County had one of the longest Democratic streaks going blue from 1956 to 2012.
Thanks for this report.  I wonder if the state’s Coronavirus spike has something to do with how slow the results have come in.  Regardless it looks like its gonna be a big win for Joe.
We'd all love to but as long as Bernie insists on still running we have to worry about uniting the party first.  Hopefully after Joe wins 4/4 states on Tuesday Bernie will bow out, I think Bernie just wants a chance for a 1 on 1 debate, and a vote after, before he drops out, which isn't that unreasonable in my opinion.  If he stays in after Tuesday then he's actively helping Trump though, and posing a health risk considering the virus.
At this point it's even a public health risk getting people to come out. Bernie has no path to the nomination so this is an unnecessary risk.
If Bernie can’t win Washington outright then no he’s not more electable than Trump. I personally like Bernie. I admire the energy he created and awareness of income inequality, something important me me. But this over.
Don't like half the states still have to vote? If the primaries ended before I got to vote I probably wouldn't vote in November
no he's not helping Trump?  Why you think that.  If Biden is nominee, then that is going to stop the covid19?  How?
I'm not sure if they will count any ballots over the weekend.  This is what the [WA SOS site says:](https://www.sos.wa.gov/office/covid-19-response.aspx)  >Starting Monday, March 16, all Secretary of State offices and divisions around the state will be closed to the public until further notice, with the exception of the executive office in the Legislative Building in Olympia.

I hope that Bernie uses the debate as a chance to allow Biden to unite the party
Sanders opened several campaign offices in PA this week. The PA primary isn't until April 28th.  Bernie's going scorched earth. He's going to drag this on until the convention, win or lose. It's what he does. Not Us, Me.
I think the race is over at this point. Poll wise.
At this point, I’ll believe it when it happens. SMH, at the real amount of dislike for this guy, the country should come first.
He’s staffing and opening new new offices in Pennsylvania as we speak, so I wouldn’t plan on him leaving anytime soon.
Well better to give up when your still fighting your way in the race?  I know you can still fight and maybe learn a thing or two throughout the race.
Yeah, but look at the delegates. It's not close anymore. I am not a Bernie bro but like Bernie a lot, I admire Warren too. But there's no path for Bernie at this point.   We should focus on November General election.
If Bernie concedes now then thousands to potentially millions of people won't need to go out in public and stand in line and vote. The virus spreads when people who don't have it come in contact with those who DO have it.  Every time Bernie says something negative about Biden, it helps Trump. It's like writing a campaign ad for him.
Biden has already done everything he can to unite the party. Virtually every Democrat has endorsed him, Sanders is the only person preventing unity now.
No, what if Biden shows up with a stroke, or something, or in worse condition.  Better to fight until the end to have DNC make up their minds.
If Biden performs as well or even close to as well as polls are showing in Florida, it’s over. My belief, as a former Bernie supporter, is that Sanders hopefully understands the stakes of this election and is just trying to land this plane and bring in as many of his supporters as possible behind the nominee
If people think the primary is "rigged" in anyway then Biden doesn't beat Trump in November
Maybe instead of endorsements it shouldn’t exists.  It sways away votes.
I think Bernie is holding out for tomorrow's debate.  Where he will attempt to convince Biden on live TV, to adopt some elements of his policies.  Then after the Tuesday states, he will dropout and endorse Biden. And can better convince his Berners to support Biden if Biden adopts some of elements of his policies. (Emphasis on "elements", and not the policies themselves. E.g. the universal aspect of M4A, but not the whole M4A and its Bernie proposed funding mechanism.)
It's over even if Biden severely underperforms his polling. Put it this way, if the polls end up being way off or Bernie has an incredible debate and it causes a 40 point swing in his favor and Bernie wins Florida by 8 points, his chances of winning the primary have gone down. He needs to win every state by at least 12-14 points in order to gain ground because Biden has such a big lead and the proportional allocation of delegates still involves him getting some amount of delegates.
Well, I don't think anyone can make that accusation because Biden's win is projected to be more prominent and decisive compared to Hillary's win over Sanders.  But either way I doubt that the progressives or the left will participate much in November.  Progressive wing is not a group big enough to win a party's nomination on their own, but they are indeed a significant group that cannot be ignored. Without the help of the left the moderates will struggle to win against Trump. Because Trump base is strong and motivated, whereas, moderates usually run a very standardized style campaign. Hillary's failure supports this.
Unfortunately, I doubt this is true. Bernie has opened 5 new campaign offices in Pennsylvania, which votes on April 28th.  [https://billypenn.com/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-is-opening-five-campaign-offices-in-joe-bidens-native-pa/](https://billypenn.com/2020/03/13/bernie-sanders-is-opening-five-campaign-offices-in-joe-bidens-native-pa/)   He is in it to divide the party, for ego reasons, or he is surrounded by sycophants. Or all of the above.
I agree, except I view it more as Bernie giving Biden the opportunity to present his platform, which actually is very progressive even if it isn’t as bold as Bernie’s. If Bernie does stay in after this week, my opinion of him will forever be changed. These are sobering times and we just don’t have the room for political games
> Well, I don't think anyone can make that accusation because Biden's win is projected to be more prominent and decisive  Well yeah right now it's not rigged, my point was more, if you try and shut down the primary it'll look shady and make people start to doubt the Democratic party. Trump has already been tweeting stuff trying to make Bernie people not vote for Biden
Exactly. Fool me once Bernie... I almost started to buy the idea of him backing out gracefully but a field office in PA?? He's taking it all the way to the convention, his ego won't allow anything less.
No, Bernie is not Ego.  What I think was Ego was when Buttigieg and Kolchubar dropped out just before Super Tuesday to endorse Biden.  Buttigieg was doing well except in one state then dropped out?  I smell it's dirty money!
I doubt Bernie people would vote for Trump. Most Bernie people voted Hillary in 16, which is why Trump lost the popular vote.  The real problem is, as Michael Moore often states, Bernie people won't door knock for Biden, or volunteer on election Day. And without the help of the left at the grassroots level, Biden could very well struggle to compete against Trump campaign.  Hillary clearly struggle on her own and lost the election without participation from the left. That to me is the biggest threat.  I hope I'm wrong, maybe Biden can start a  'moderate' movement that can give Trump a run for his money.
It's interesting that you suggest this is about ego rather than ideas.  Joe Biden was an also-ran just 16 days ago according to the polls.  Now his lead seems unassailable, but so did Sanders' at that time.
Is this sarcastic? Dropping out to support a friendly candidate is the opposite of egotistical.
Most Bernie people don't even vote. Trump won last time because white working class people hated Hillary's guts. The progressives are a minority among minorities.
Lmao Biden at no point (even when he was an "also ran") needed +65% of the remaining vote to reach a plurality of delegates. Bernie currently does, meanwhile he might lose Florida by 65%. He is done.
Not when your doing well. It didn’t make sense unless he was paid to do so.
White working class didn't just hate Hillary, the narrative at that time as I remember was they felt let down by the Democrats, they also hated Obama, and may very well punish the party all over again.  There is no realistic path to nomination for Bernie at this point, but to say 'the progressives are a minority among minority' is a statement completely out of touch with reality.  Bernie won 1800+ delegates, and 13 million+ (43%),  and he is well en route to replicate a similar results.  Progressives are certainly not a group big enough to take over a party, but to say they are a minority of minority is just wishful thinking. And this type of miscalculation may very well cost the Democrats all over again as it did in 2016.
I mean, confidence is good - I am just pointing out that political fortunes built on polling numbers are won and lost without a lot of warning.
Pete Buttigieg mulling endorsement of Joe Biden after talking with Obama

Only a matter of time. Pete is good people. I believe we're going to see Democratic unity long before the convention and it will be powerful. People who drink the koolaid say Joe is passive, What they don't get is Biden is the anti-Drumpf, he is power and strength without bluster. What a sad world we live in that so many Americans believe *might is right*.   Joe and friends 2020!!
Oh the histrionics from the Bros will be glorious. Glorious!
I can’t wait. I need salt for my fries.
I think he’s going to do it but it might be best to hold and do it tomorrow with Biden’s speech.   If Bernie wins most states we would still have big momentum going forward and the media would play Buttigiegs endorsement + Biden’s speech. Maybe doing it today wouldn’t have a big impact as most people wouldn’t be aware by tomorrow and I’m not sure how Pete’s endorsement would impact in just 24hrs Texas and California for example.   I’d be happy either way - but just putting out there that if he doesn’t endorse today it could still be a good play.
Sorry but there is no chance that Pete endorses Bernie. No fucking way. I hope we get the endorsement before Super Tuesday.
I'm a die-hard Pete supporter. My wife often accuses me of being more into Pete than her. I sincerely hope Pete continues to do what's best for the country and endorse Joe Biden, and that President Biden in turn nurtures Pete's experience and fully supports him in the future. This is what leadership truly is, on both counts.
OHHH THE HOLY TRIFECTA.  This would be huge.
I saw this coming. When Pete made his speech, he made one thing clear: he is not going to endorse Bernie Sanders.  Edit: clarity
Oh my, that’s a proxy endorsement from barack   Nice
Dooooo Itttttttttt!!!!!!
Gotta do it today to make any difference
It’s the only move that makes sense. Pete’s brand is center-left, and endorsing Bernie helps him far less, and hurts him more (especially in Indiana, should he decide in the future to run for a State office) than endorsing Joe Biden.
I just got chills thinking of the amount of class and professionalism that must have been colliding in that conversation...
I supported Buttigieg and would have no problem going to Biden.  His rhetoric isn't looking to divide America.
Mayor Pete just booked a private jet from South Abend to Dallas. Seems like he’s going to endorse Joe at his rally tonight together with Amy.
I was on #TeamPete for the past year, but now I'm fully on board with Biden2020! I've already setup a recurring donation.
The real question is will they back us if Joe is the nominee or claim its a rigged conspiracy to stop Bernie? I think I know the answer. We cannot afford to go into the general election divided Obama is really gonna have his hands full helping joe unite everyone.
He also chatted with Jimmy Carter.
I can't believe I am here. Pete endorsed, and so I am. Voting for Joe tomorrow in Mass.
Pete is a hell of a man.   Early on, at first I was wondering what is this guy doing in the election, I pitted him as someone just in it for some publicity so he can pad his resume and sell a memo. After reading a little about him and his background, seeing more of him, wow.. a hell of a man,  Please make him Secretary of State. It would be so proud to see him represent US on the international stage.
Good for Pete. I wasn't and am not a huge Joe Biden supporter but at this point he's the only option to prevent any of the 2 radical extremes. He's also a lot preferrable to Hilary Clinton so moderates like myself are very happy to see Klobuchar and hopefully Buttigieg (both of who I really liked) support Biden because this is not a drill we could have a far left socialist up vs. whatever the hell Trump is and 2 extremes is not what the country needs. Continuing the legacy of Obamacare and creating a medicare like option for those who want it is fine. Bankrupting the country trying to afford a ton of seemingly good social safety net benefits that we simply cannot afford is not. Neither is demonizing the capitalistic social democracy that is fundamental to the success and foundation of our country.
Can we get a source other than NYDN?  Edit: https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/pete-buttigieg-endorsement-obama-biden-calls/index.html
I was (and remain) a HUGE Pete guy. I think the vision he created and the plans he had were amazing. But one of the things that really stuck with me was his emphasis on *unity*, *truth* and *healing*.  Joe is the only remaining candidate that I feel truly represents a desire for unity, and not only within our side of the aisle. Joe is a good man through and through, and even if I don’t feel his policies are *as* progressive as I would like, I trust him wholeheartedly to follow through on what he’s proposing, and to begin the process of mending our broken country.  I think Pete felt that too - every interaction between the two, even when they were at odds with one another, was primarily policy or experience based. Joe stood up for Pete and Pete stood up for Joe, even as they competed against one another. Their criticisms of one another were honest and based in reality, rather than fabricated out of a desire to appear more “pure.” I’d be *shocked* if Pete did anything except endorse Biden, and I’m more than happy to cast my vote with Joe 💎
The ones on my Facebook timeline have been saying for months that Pete is just a pro-Joe DNC plant, so yeah. I'm sure they're fastening their tin foil hats right now.
I wonder when Obama will endorse?
I think he should do it today. The post-Super Tuesday states are already heavily Biden favored, and any bump he gets from Pete would be more effective now.
Picture this... it's a Bernie rally. After some long hard thought, Pete has decided to make a surprise appearance and endorse. He takes a deep breath a walks out on the stage, only to be met with chants of "rat" and "Wall Street Pete".....  Yeah, no... that's why you don't shit on other candidates so hard in the primary *of your own damn party*. Even if he wanted to endorse Bernie they burned that bridge.
Biden and pelvis need to nurture genXers and Millenial Democrats into government and leadership positions. I say this as a gay Latino left handed GenXer
not bragging or anything, but I'm a huge pete guy too 😂  but seriously, I'm right there with you
A "pro-Joe plant" who could have taken the nomination if Bloomberg and Iowa's incompetence hadn't sucked all of the oxygen out of his win in Iowa.  Hardly. Mayor Pete and Vice President Biden are ideological allies and are both decent people. But their rivalry was real.
*lightning flashes over DNC HQ*  Tom Perez: Greetings fellow neoliberal corporate shills. How will we prevent the succs from raising the red banner over DC this election cycle!  Evil DNC member: Let's divide up our vote across multiple non-commies. The Bernie Bros will make flaming gaping horse's asses of themselves, infuriating all the other campaigns, which will then drive them all to support The Establishment once more!  Tom Perez: Brilliant!  But how do we find the other candidates who will drop out at the last minute?  Evil DNC member 2: I have it! There's this mayor in a town in Indiana... And isn't Amy Klobuchar having a slow year?  Tom Perez: Brilliant! BRILLIANT!  *zoom out of the scene as the entire DNC cackles with evil glee*
While calling him a Pro-Joe plant is absurd, you can’t deny that dropping out just before Super Tuesday points towards a more tactical motivation; even if Pete had rough odds going into Super Tuesday, it’s absolutely not out of the realm of possibility that *at this stage of the game*, either Biden’s campaign or the DNC struck some form of a deal with him to step down and funnel more support to(presumably) Biden.  I really don’t think that’s a tin foil hat theory. That would just be the DNC/Biden playing the election game. Again, calling Pete a pro-Joe plant is a ridiculous assertion. It’s clear he had every intention of winning the nom. But let’s be careful of taking the converse too far; throwing in the towel right before Super Tuesday doesn’t make a lot of sense in Pete’s position. Otherwise, why the hell is Gabbard still in?
I’d like to make a point that every candidate has a portion of supporters that get too intense and don’t speak for the candidate. I have lots of friends that are Bernie supporters and they disavow the “Bernie bros” and the divisiveness they are spewing online. I also think there is a fair probability that a portion of them could be trolls, perhaps financed by Russia.   I do think that if sanders is serious about getting the nom that he is going to have to make serious in roads and repairing the bridges the bro’s have been burning with all of the other candidates.
In the general, 100%
Anything that tips the scale in our favor, but I have to say I think Biden is going to sweep ST. We might lose California (mostly because of Bloomberg) but we are going win Texas. We are surging everywhere.
> in the primary of your own damn party  well akkschually, it’s not Bernie’s party
You're 100% right. The Bros have sustained such a toxic atmosphere toward anyone that is not Bernie that it would be an embarrassment for all Dems.
I'm imagining a future where Pete ends up endorsing Biden and after super Tuesday the Biden Sanders delegate is somewhat close. I can totally see an an anti Bernie add about his supporters with Pete calling out all the times he has been called a "republican rat" or "fake gay" or "cia operative", and I think a part of the Bernie crowd that isn't too extreme switching over to Biden.
I agree, as an omni-sexual libertarian-conservative Canadian who doesn't believe that people my age and Pete's age are millennials, despite that being the current consensus.   Back in the day, we used to say we (the generation after Gen X) were the echo generation (the echo to the Baby Boom) or Gen Y, and millennials were the kids that came \*after\* us. I just believe that people who came of age before social media had/have a fundamentally different upbringing than people who came of age afterwards. By came of age, I mean puberty and formative teen years leading into a -adulthood.  /soapbox
Pelvis = Pelosi
I AM bragging, I’m gonna miss Mayor Pete. Until he runs again and kicks ass
While they were vying for the same position, I wonder how much of it was personal. Like with Bernie and Hillary, it got pretty personal. Same with Amy and Pete. But I've just never gotten that vibe from Biden and Buttigieg.
LMFAO that made my afternoon 😂
Seriously like... “why don’t we rig the Iowa caucus so that the front runner and incredibly popular Vice President of our last administration wins?    “Instead... why don’t we rig it for a no name Indiana mayor polling in 4th and then make it take weeks for the results actually come out so he doesn’t get a full poll jump?”
Yeah, I think that ‘politics’ is inherently a dirty word to some folks, but everyone in the race is indeed a POLITICIAN!! Bernie, Joe, Liz, Pete, all of them. They all make strategic political choices everyday. It isn’t a bad thing to take stock and play some politics. It’s an art!
If you were in his shoes, wouldn't you have done the same thing? Staying in the race would have lead to a long primary ending in a contested convention, which would be horribly divisive for the country. He looked at his chances and decided his better option was to leverage the support he's gained for a different position. It's not conspiratorial, it's smart.
This is a bit over ambitious. We’re going to lose CO, Utah, Maine,  and Vermont for sure as well as Minnesota and Massachusetts (though hopefully Klobuchar and Warren can win their home states).  If we win TX, VA, and the rest of the south that’s a big win for us. We’ve also gotta do solidly in CA. If we end ST within 100 delegates of Sanders, I think we win this.
It currently looks to be:   **Solid Sanders**: California, Colorado, Utah, Vermont  **Likely Sanders**: Maine  **Lean Sanders**: Massachusetts   **Tossup**: American Samoa, Texas   **Solid Biden**: Arkansas, Alabama  **Likely Biden**: North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia  **Lean Biden**: Oklahoma   **Lean Klobuchar**: Minnesota   Looking good for Biden but could be better. Hopefully some Pete voters can help us out in California and a nice boost from Bloomberg's decline and SC advantages can give us Texas  **EDIT**: Nevermind Klobuchar just dropped out, RIP having any fucking clue what's happening tomorrow
I hope so. It seems to be trending that way. We need to hope Bloomberg falls off as hard as Steyer did in SC.
According to 538, if Biden sweeps the south tomorrow and is able to take Texas, he becomes the front runner for a plurality of delegates and even has about a 1/3 chance or reaching a majority even if Bernie wins everywhere else tomorrow.
lol true
Lmao tell that to the Bros
I said this in the S4P sub last night, my first and only comment before being permanently banned.. I finally couldn't help myself because their post about Pete dropping out that made it to r/all:  If I was going to migrate to Bernie now that Pete has dropped, I certainly wouldn't want to participate in their Reddit channels. Maybe I would vote for him, maybe I would donate, but I wouldn't set foot in that toxic cesspool.
The Bros are a very loud minority of Sanders' supporters. They sicken me too. Right after Pete announced he was dropping out, a bunch of Bros went on the Pete sub and started shitting all over everyone.  It makes me want to facepalm my hand through the back of my skull. That toxic divisiveness is the reason the left has such a hard time holding onto the office. Fuck the Bernie Bros.  -a normal guy who voted for Bernie in the Primary  Edit: missing words
I personally don't see that happen. Despite him having a percentage of toxic supporters, even the non-extremists tend to be rightfully passionate for his policies and integrity. No other candidate has a consistent message over their career like he does and only Warren comes close when it comes to policies.  If you can switch from Bernie to Biden before the primary is over, I'd argue that you didn't vote based on policy; the two aren't remotely similar. In my country, Bernie would be center left and Biden would be right wing.
I agree, btw I’m living in Montreal since last year. So voting tomorrow with DA
Took a moment to get it. That was a ride.
Till then, I’m all in for Joe 😤
Yeah, I think there's real mutual respect there.
I personally think him dropping out now gives Biden more of a shot, particularly in California. This looks to *increase* the odds of a contested convention, unless a MAJOR change of pace happens yesterday. That’s just my observation.  I’m not saying Pete made a bad decision, particularly if he’s looking to score a cabinet position from whoever he endorses or some other political benefit. And him dropping out definitely helps Biden and Warren more because frankly, they need it right now.
For me, personally, I’ll vote for whoever Pete endorses, because he’d endorse someone that aligns with his views and platform.  And I think many other Pete supporters see the same
Biden is taking Oklahoma! I
I think with Buttigieg dropping out both Biden and Warren may be viable in California which helps to take some major wind out of Bernie's sails. I hope enough Bloomberg voters realize he is just a worse version of Biden in every way except financially and they consolidate behind Biden to give him a boost.
Unfortunately, I already sent in my mail in for Pete.
Agreed.
As a Bernie supporter, may I suggest r/WayoftheBern as a more palatable Bernie sub?
I have so many dear friends who voted (or will vote) for Bernie, and I know most of them are regular, good people. But unfortunately the minority of toxic, cultish Bros are a real phenomenon, and if Bernie loses, that will be a big reason why.
Here's to hoping we can see you around here more going forward! Pete's a great guy, not my first choice but I was very impressed by him. I hope he's the future of the party.
Make it happen!! :-)
I personally prefer Sanders, but if people want to vote centrist, they had better vote Biden. Bloomberg has a pretty iffy track record and some policies so far to the right he'd almost make more sense as a republican.
It may not be as bad but that's a very low bar to clear. At just a glance it seems quite toxic as well, with lots of attacks against other candidates in thread titles and comments.
Agreed.  If the left loses that will be one of the biggest reasons why.  I've been following Bernie since the late 90s (CSPAN!), and I really want him to win.  I don't want him to win at the expense of unity among the left though.  Maybe he's not electable, but at least his presence is drawing attention to the issues we're now talking about.  The fact that Mayor Pete, the first openly gay presidential contender,  did so well is also a clear indication that the LBGT folks *are* electable. Even though Pete is dropping out, he'll always have my admiration for helping to open that door.  Why the Bros feel the need to attack his supporters instead of just his policies is beyond me.  :(
Speak this into existence!
Agreed. Bloomberg is not a true democrat, he's a less-horrible Republican. I think Biden will let the liberal and progressive wings of the Democratic party do their thing if he is elected president, with Bloomberg I can't say as much.

Welcome and glad to have you!  Pete has a bright future and I'm very excited to see what he can accomplish in the future. Hope you can help Joe out by donating and promoting him to your friends, family, and on social media!
This is where I am. Yang>Pete>Warren supporter in Arizona holding onto my early ballot to try to determine who is going to be best suited to knock off Sanders and Bloomberg.   Might be Biden gets it, after last night.
Bloomberg supporter here in NC. Voting Joe to help him win the state. As much as I would rather have Mike running the country, I want to stop Sanders more and hope Joe knocks Trump out in the general.
I did too! I love Pete. I think he will be my president one day, but Joe's going to demolish Trump and restore our reputation....I mean he already knows all the world leaders.
Thank you for taking Pete's words of "We don't want to wake up the day after Super Tuesday with the only viable candidates being Bernie and Bloomberg" to heart.  It's disappointing that Pete's campaign is falling so soon after his monumental win in Iowa, but I do know he has a prominent spot in the Democratic party for years to come.  Welcome to the team, man!
I still support Pete whole-heartedly, but Joe's got my vote in the primary now. Bernie already put Trump in the white house once, don't want to have him be responsible for keeping him there.
Props - I was floating between Buttigieg and Biden until super recently. Hopefully we’re part of the rumored boost!
Kinda same boat! I volunteered for both and am 100% voting for Joe now. Pete’s going to do great things in the future- I hope he gets a cabinet position! 💕
Was a Joe supporter until I heard Pete speak, and he instantly won me over. Joe dropped to my numbers 2-10.   With Mayor Pete dropping out, I will be doing everything I can to make sure Joe Biden is the nominee and President of the United States.
Bless you. We have got to stop Bernie!
I already voted Pete by mail, but I support Joe in spirit 😔
I voted for Joe this morning for the same reason. I read Pete’s book and have been following him closely, I also was a big fan of Yang and signed up for a fundraiser before he dropped out. When the Coronavirus started spreading in the US, I realized how badly I want someone in charge who has experience in the arena. After SC, the choice is now clear. Let’s go Joe!
Pete really is great, I can't wait to see where he goes next.
Now that Pete has dropped out looks like I'm supporting Biden now.  I like Bernie but I just don't think he can pull enough votes in crucial states to win.
SC Democrat here. Loved Pete as a candidate and was planning on voting for him for a while. Checked the polls before going in to vote and Pete was projecting around 8%. Voted for Biden who was my #2.  Hope to see big things out of Pete in the future, but Joe is our guy now.  With Pete and Steyer officially out, I’m hoping the Biden momentum snowballs!

WELCOME TO TEAM JOE!!  Let's defeat Trump!
Same here!  💎💎💎💎
Pete to Joe here too, checking in.
Biden/Pete 2020? I’ll vote
wy u no wan bern
Same here. I am all for Pete and will support him throughout his career. Time to support his endorsement. #petetojoe
Joe Biden can’t be trump
I was also all for Pete! Volunteered for him and everything. Gonna go with Biden now
[removed]
Yes. I'm a huge Mayor Pete fan and look forward to supporting President Pete some other year!  But right now we have to beat Trump, which means beating Bernie.
[removed]
We have to rack up as many popular votes and delegates for Biden as possible to blunt any charge that the nomination was "stolen" from Bernie.
Californian here. Held my ballot until it was clear on Wednesday/Thursday that he would win SC, then voted and mailed my ballot in for him.
Yang>Kamala>Pete>and now Biden here.
Awesome!! Thank you!
Thank you sir/ma'am. You're putting the country first,that's what matters.
[removed]
Yes, exactly!  Pete2024 or Pete2028 or Pete2032  BIDEN2020
Seriously,I respect him so muchfor practicing what he preached.
FOH with that bs. He held dozens of rallies for her. She was an abysmal candidate who represented the everything that people hated about washington. That's why she lost
no hate can someone explain how someone who is NOT the nominee is responsible. Hillary dropped the ball
Yes! Let's get Joe over 15% everywhere he can't win to rack up his popular vote and delegate totals!
I always wait because it's normal there are major last minute shifts before election day. It was rumored that Pete was considering dropping out last night but decided to stay in.
Pete is forecasted to win between 5 and 13% of the vote in CA:  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/california/  Any votes for Pete just turn into delegates for Bernie.
Thanks! For the record, I made that switch hours ago when Pete was still in the race.
I THINK for myself about politics. Hours a day. I follow everything.  But leave it to you Bernie Bros to call everyone else dumb. You cannot inspire a large enough movement with anger. And that's why Bernie isn't getting as large a youth vote as Obama did.
Where do you think we go from here if Bernie wins the nom? Does Pete try for a cabinet position or set his sights on ‘24/‘28?

I've actually seen them complaining that South Carolina was "stolen." Well the few that aren't making blatantly racist comments about how people of color didn't vote the "right way."
Well. Looks like it’s a good thing I didn’t mail in that Pete ballot
I'm not sure if this account is real? Their entire post history is divisive and vitriolic, and I don't see how any actual rational person could think this type of posting could be constructive in any way.  If you are a real person—why do this? What's the point?
Cool story bro.
Fun fact, Pete could run for President in 2060 and he'd still be younger than Sanders is now
Bernie took his sweet-ass time endorsing her and then only did so half-heartedly and did nothing about all the bullshit conspiracy theories of the DNC "rigging" it, which destroyed almost any sense of party unity and t[en percent of his bros voted for Trump as a protest](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds). Those votes could have helped in the states hillary narrowly lost.
He stayed in after he was eliminated and spent months calling Clinton unqualified and corrupted and the result was enough of his primary supporters didn't forClinton to ghost get PA MI and WI and therefore Trump won the EC with 3 million fewer votes than Clinton.
Fingers crossed for CA - tons of late voters here, so I think we’ll do well for 2nd.
[deleted]
You can just report comments like that
[removed]
Why not both?
Nyet.
The Russians are supporting Bernie because they know he'd lose to Trump.  They've probably probably got stuff on him from when he worshipped the USSR.
The only positive thing I have to say about the Bernie Bros is at least they’re consistent. Any group of people gets attacked, it was homophobia with Pete, misogyny with Warren, and now racism with the SC voters. Just crazy.
Ohio Pete supporter here - voted early, before Pete dropped out.  Biden is the last best hope.

Recent polling all him him between 15% and 19% in CA. We got this!
Sure, but we must narrow the gap between Biden's delegates and Bernie's delegates, so it can't be said the nomination was "stolen."  We CANNOT split the delegates. Sorry, Pete, Amy, Elizabeth, Mike... it's time to go home.  But I'll be on Team Pete next time around!!
I prefer they're out there to let people see what Bernie supporters are really like.
Rule 10. Try again and get banned.

Worshipped the USSR? Come on man
Enough with the Bernie Bro bullcrap. Bernie has flaws, but to blame him for people online being mean is so blatantly, stupidly ignorant of internet culture it’s embarrassing. Also, I challenge you to show me evidence of Bernie supporters attacking Pete about being gay.
I'm a Sanders supporter, you can check my comment history.  Actions like the ones you take aren't going to win the election or convince anyone. Take an honest look at what you're commenting and ask yourself if you really think it's helpful in any way.  If anything it is harmful to Sanders' reelection, and he would disavow your comments the same way he has disavowed other toxic 'supporters'.
He also said vote with your heart pretty much implying that he’d be ok with his followers not voting for the nominee.
He didn't drip out. He went to the convention having already lost. That's but dropping out. It's not called forfeiting when the game ends and your behind,that's called losing.
We want to keep the sub positive instead of letting them start catfights.
Malarkey in a no malarkey zone!
30 days.
You're right, the past tense was a mistake.
A lot of his supporters in real life are complete fucks too. It’s not just the internet. And I don’t see any other candidates supporters spreading conspiracies like Bernie’s.   > Also, I challenge you to show me evidence of Bernie supporters attacking Pete about being gay.  How about when his campaign staffer did it? Get lost. https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-staffer-mocked-elizabeth-warrens-looks-pete-buttigiegs-sexuality-on-private-twitter-account
For all the talk you guys do about “unity” you sure as heck don’t seem to care about bringing any Sanders supporters along for the ride. You can talk all you want, but you’ll need us if Joe becomes the nominee.   Hint, this isn’t the way to do it.
That doesn't mean that he caused her to lose. Derp
That totally makes sense.
Ok, fair enough. It’s worth pointing out that he was fired and disavowed by Bernie, but fair enough. I would still point out, however, that you are still talking about a very small percentage of people out of millions of supporters. To apply the “Bernie Bro” smear still seems pretty disingenuous to me, considering the overall vitriolic nature of online culture.
If I legit thought that Sanders supporters would actually vote for the dem nominee, I might. But given how they've treated us since day one in a manner surprisingly worse than Trump's little inbreds, sorry bro: sympathy file not found.
No, the fact that enough of his primary supporters either didn't vote, voted 3rd part or some other protest vote, or voted Trump to cost her PA, MI, and WI does though.
Besides, we all see their behavior everywhere else.
I know he was fired and I commend Bernie for that statement. But maybe it’s time to look at what is drawing these people to his campaign and what he can do to discourage the bad actors. If I felt that Bernie was doing a good job of that, I’d have given his campaign a look when Pete dropped.   >  To apply the “Bernie Bro” smear still seems pretty disingenuous to me, considering the overall vitriolic nature of online culture.   I’m obviously not talking about all of you guys. I have some friends that are Bernie supporters that are totally fine and can have a discussion. I also have some friends who are Bernie Bros that are great people and then flip a switch and become unhinged when they talk about Sanders. I don’t see how it’s disingenuous though, none of what I said is non-factual.   Additionally, I’ve spent time on a ton of different forums about my hobbies, even some that can be pretty toxic like college football pages and bodybuilding.com forums and I have seen nothing like the hate I’ve seen from Bernie’s supporters and it’s not close. I have seen a few snarky comments from other supporters, but Bernie’s are the only ones who are truly vitriolic.
I held my nose and voted Clinton in 16 and I’ll do the same this go around if need be. That being said, this snarky “sorry bro” attitude is the exact thing you complain about from Sanders supporters. Maybe you should recheck your files if we’re supposed to be on the same side.   If you want me to check myself, maybe you need to look in the mirror too.
I think, esp now after 4 years of Trump, there are a lot more Bernie supporters that will still come to the party and vote blue in November.   We’ve allowed the GOP to move the entire country so far to the right that Obama, a moderate, looked like a leftist and Bernie, a candidate advocating for us to essentially get on Europe’s level re: social safety nets, is treated like a lunatic.   For the record, I’m Team Warren. We really do need substantial structural changes made. And we need to remind our voters that the Democratic Party is unified around basic human dignity: including healthcare, good education, safety from gun violence, and loving who you want to love. It all centers around dignity. That should be how we brand and prioritize our goals.   This means the nominee, whoever she (here’s hoping) might be, needs to not shy away from left-leaning priorities all the way through Nov.   Swing voters are a myth and I think moderates are also polarizing more than we think. I’m blue no matter who, but it *is* foolish to cast aside “Bernie bros” as if there aren’t serious grievances or problems to address in our party.*  *blah blah he’s not *in* the party, just because he technically isn’t doesn’t mean his supporters aren’t
Lol, so much projection. You people just can't accept that Hillary Clinton was a horrible candidate, so you have to blame others.  She didn't ONCE come to Wisconsin. She deserved to lose the state
Centrist dems aren't good at self-awareness. They try and call us nazis and blame us for trump winning, and then they scream and cry and about all the "mean" Sanders supporters online. What a joke
You sound so happy Trump won, Sanders Supporter. I wonder why that is.  And if Clinton was such a bad candidate, Sanders must be really terrible since he lost to her by 4 million votes.   Oh, and she canceled her trip to WI because she went to Florida in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting. What did Sanders do? Besides voting against the kind of gun regulations that would prevent such massacres from occurring?
>You sound so happy Trump won, Sanders Supporter. I wonder why that is.  Lol, not sure where you're getting that from but ok.  >And if Clinton was such a bad candidate, Sanders must be really terrible since he lost to her by 4 million votes.   Of course she did, she was much more well known. She's still a flip-flopping corporate puppet.   >Oh, and she canceled her trip to WI because she went to Florida in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting. What did Sanders do? Besides voting against the kind of gun regulations that would prevent such massacres from occurring?  She can easily reschedule. She had no excuse. If you can't even be bothered to show up in a state, you can't get upset when they vote for the other guy. Sanders wants an assault rifles ban and common sense gun regulations. Vermont is a generally rural, pro-gun state.
CNN has projected that Joe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Virginia!
Not a good sign for Sanders. He spent a lot of time there. This is huge.
This is huge: Biden is performing MUCH  better than even in the latest positive poll.  Bloomberg is going from 20% in the polls to 8%..
Biden voter reporting from Northern VA!  Was thrilled to check "No Malarkey" on the ballot this morning
CNN exit poll  Biden is dominating Sanders among African American voters. Look at that amazing margin!  https://i.imgur.com/6I6g4f7.png  This is a huge win for Joe Biden.
yo mr joe biden im proud of u
:) Just thinking about all that malarkey that's gonna be defeated today
This is a W on the board for Joe Biden!  CNN: This is going to be a decisive win for Joe Biden in Virginia.
#Woo Hoo!  Question: Why is only projected to get at least 16 out of 99 delegates? That doesn't sound like a lot.
Lol this news came out like 4 mins after I voted. I voted at 6:59 PM :)
Final 538 poll average has him winning by 19. He won by 32%! Hopefully we'll see the same everywhere with a surge as in SC.
Yes indeed!
I'm one of those votes! Yay!
Absolute beatdown
Biden is the comeback kid! Go Joe!
Lets go Joe!
Expected AND fantastic!

Oh noooooooo, poor Bernie. Darn it.
How is it huge when 538 was forecasting Biden winning 98-2 in Virginia? They predicted the delegate split to be 52-26, which is more or less how it looks like.
Biden had one office there and Bernie outspent him 7:1.  Biden has the type of broad support that money just can't buy.
The younger generation isn’t voting. At least not in the primary. It’s a shame. I’m not much older than the 18-29 bracket, but I have voted for everything since I was 18. Don’t people understand what a mistake it is not to exercise their basic right?  Edit to add: obviously I am not for Bernie. Just disappointment in people not understanding what our ancestors fought for.
Me too!
Winning 3 to 1. This is what HRC did last time. So much for his more diverse support this time.
 Arrr politics becoming a dog whistling racist cesspool I. 3... 2...
Those are just the initial delegates that they can estimate. It'll be calculated when the votes are counted.
Also, the other candidates can still get delegates if they reach the 15% viability threshold.
That bad?
Go back to your Bernie circle jerk.
Yea, people who don't agree with you exist! You're growing up so fast!  This is why Sanders has no friends.
We don’t much care for malarkey around these parts
What do you mean?
Lol I know right?
I'm just absolutely crushed, in total shambles ^(/s)
Their final poll average had him ahead by 19% and he won by 32% [This site is a great resource for comparing final polls to actual vote totals for each state](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/virginia/).
It is so weird that my generation (am 16) is so politically active on social media, but isnt showing up to vote...
Virginia has pretty much something every year.   Our governor election is a year after a presidential, then the midterms, then state delegates the year after, and another presidential.  2017 was the last meaningful election Ive voted in because Tim Kaine was super safe in 2018 and live in a deep blue district.  Still you have to show up.
This is exactly why many of us don’t really believe the polls and think that Biden is a much stronger candidate against Trump.  Old people vote.    Biden has baggage, but it isn’t Hillary-level.
Oh absolutely. I wish purple generally we're more active in the political projprocess
I’m 21. The only election I’ve missed was a referendum on a bond issue for a new police station that I missed because I was out of town and unaware of the referendum. I have now voted in 1 midterm election, 1 midterm primary, 2 town elections, 3 annual town budget referendums, and 3 re-dos (1st year-0 2nd-2, 3rd-1), and I’m excited to vote for Joe in my first presidential primary on April 28th.
Amen, brother!  Proud to be a part of the 53.3%.
Cool. Glad to hear that. :D
How can it be a win, before the votes are counted ?
Oh yea..., that's right.
Yes, just got banned
Because Twitter isn't real life.
Where I live there are a minimum of 2 elections each year. The annual budget referendum and the general election. The odd numbered years have town elections in November. The even numbered years have more elections, as there are primaries, and presidential primaries are held on a different date from the other primaries, so there will be at least 4 elections this year, assuming there is a contested primary at some level for the non-presidential elections. The number of elections can go up if the budget referendum fails, which means they have to draft a new budget and submit it again, and occasionally there are special town referendums on bond issues or other matters of importance.
I hope so.
I’m a little late to the party, but I did my party. NoVA represent!!! ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
They make a projection based on exit polls and recent polls.   The media will say if a race is too close too call otherwise, if there's overwhelming evidence for a decisive win, they'll make an early projection. For example, no one has any reason to doubt Sanders would not win Vermont.
Dear Bernie Sanders supporter, we love you, we want you, we need you. Please join us.
The Mods back this statement of welcome.
There is so much more that unites us, help make Joe a better candidate.
"This is your campaign!" -Joe
Thanks for the positive message.   I'm still going to fight my heart out for the policies Bernie wants to roll out,  but if push comes to shove and Biden wins the primary- you got my vote in the general.
I love Elizabeth Warren's plans, passion, and persistence.  I love Bernie's vision and bold ideas.  I love Joe's ability to bring people together.  That's how my preferences have changed this primary cycle. Let's win.
We have our differences, lets use them to be better people!
❤️👏🏽👊🏽
Getting Trump out of office is **THE** most important thing. There's so much riding on this, we need a Democrat in office again. Blue no matter who
This result needs to marinate.  Folks at r/politics are not taking it well.  Which is expected.  Give them folks time to decompress.
Reaches out with a heavily sanitized hand. We will love you!
My hopes for the future are dead but I'll be voting Biden in November... I'll never be a Biden supporter but at the very least we can be united in getting Trump out...
Am 100% behind not gloating.
Too soon.  Too erotic.
Dear Joe Biden Supporter, most of us will. Only a small minority of us think Biden = Trump.
I will hold my nose and vote.  &#x200B;  I really wanted M4A and my student loans forgiven.
“If you do politics the right way, I believe, you can actually make people’s lives better. And integrity is the minimum ante to get into the game.”-- Joe Biden.  If nothing this is what we all can agree on. Thanks for joining us.
You'll have us soon enough. Russians gonna Russian though.... Accusations will fly. This Bernie voter will ROTR and vote blue no matter who.
The only reason I would ever vote for this guy is cause he’s just not trump
Bernie supporters---I get it.  I know that Joe isn't as flashy and doesn't have as many super massive structural changes.  But he has solid policies, and he can put out the fire.
My point exactly, sanders supporters are not our "enemies" ,we can come together and build a strong party and defend Trump in November.
I'll def support Joe in the general, but it's just disappointing right now, seeing who I think is the worse candidate, the one that is less likely to win against trump, winning right now, and will probably win the nomination.  I wish I could discuss with you, I'm so (perhaps too) convinced that Bernie strictly dominates Joe both in terms of policy and electability
Can someone explain some things like I'm 5?  I was reading his political website and he said something about paying 5% of your income after taxes for 20 years on student loans? That's fuckin sick. I like him already. Is this true?  How does the man feel about legalizing marijuana? I am sick of being fearful of my job because I like to partake in smoking the herb.   Will he make healthcare more affordable? I'm a relatively healthy 24 year old male so I don't have many problems at the moment, but I'd like to know I can afford a hospital visit say if I get injured somehow.   I will think of more as I get some responses, but this is the conversation Bernie / Yang supporters need to hear.
Go to Joe.
we need to take it up on ourselves to find common similarities with Bernie supporters and get behind joe as he can unite us against trump which is important for America
I think Biden could do it without the Bernie voters, but I really don't want to. So many of my friends are Bernie supporters, and I hate the divisions and antagonism. I really hope we can all unite back together, it's so important. We all have the same goals, and while Biden and Sanders have different policies, they're going in the same direction. Trump is going in the opposite direction. I really hope the Bernie votes see that.
As a Warren supporter, this really only helps after Sanders ends his campaign. Right now, Sanders supporters may be holding out for hope, and asking them this is pretty annoying. The warren sub got so many Bernie posts...
[removed]
Clearly.
I liked Warren, then Bernie, I'll vote for Biden just for the Supreme Court but just to let you guys know, I'm 25 and basically everyone I know irl or otherwise is saying they straight up won't vote for Biden in the general. He's gotta do something to get the youth vote or he's gonna lose in November
[removed]
[deleted]
I don’t mean to be troll like here. But there are two things that I can’t get past when it comes to Biden.   1. The videos of him getting too handsy with little girls.   2. The deterioration of his ability to speak properly.    As supporters of him, do these issues not bother you?
This is a hard no for me. Good luck and godspeed but count me out. Not voting period if Biden is the nominee.
[removed]
I’m not blue no matter who.  He will have a lot of maturing to do as a candidate.  He has a history of modifying his vote to keep himself relevant.  That reeks to most voters and is a serious turnoff.  My union the IAFF endorsed him and he couldn’t even say it right on one of his recent speeches.  That really turned me off.  I need authenticity.  His exchange with the union worker today was a huge turnoff.  I’m a life long democrat and I own a lot of guns.  I’m not giving them up.  Telling his aide to “shush” and telling a guy who was calm that he would take it outside was very trumpish.  We will see how he holds up against  trump.  I’m very very worried.  Regardless trump will never ever ever have my vote.
My friends will die of medical bankruptcy under Biden’s ObamaCare proposal. My children will not survive the climate Biden is now walking us into.  I have no reason left to vote in November. I hope you all understand
[removed]
Nah.
Never
As a Bernie voter, I really hope this does not get to be like 2016.  Edit: In that, I don't want the uglyness and division in the party. ROTR.
If Sanders' supporters could make Joe a better candidate, why vote for Joe instead of Bernie?
"counted out, knocked down...." Cause joe knows a thing or two about that
Yeah I'm a Bernie supporter, just coming to check out this sub. I will vote for Biden if he wins the nomination. I'm shocked by how surprised I am that this sub is filled with reasonable, chill, and kind people. I've been on Twitter way too long.   Anyway, hello. 👋 Just dropping by, you don't have to worry about this voter turning her back to voting in the GE. I do want to implore y'all: if Bernie doesn't make the nomination, please help us fight for progressive change. I think that is why emotions and passion are so high in our movement. Because there's a lot of things that need fixing in our country, and we don't want to go back to the status quo. So please, when you welcome any new Bernie supporters, let them know you're dedicated to helping, that you do care about progressive issues. (If you do care about progressive issues, not trying to put words in anyone's mouth.)   We're scared because we don't want people deported. We don't want people locked in cages on the border, freezing and starving on the streets, locked away in jail because they can't afford bail. We're so much more alike than different. and the best way to win our allegiance is to help us fight for the human rights that we're worried are slipping from our fingers. If you get behind us and are willing to work with us, you'll combat our fears a lot quicker and more effectively, I think.
I loved Amy’s ability to get the job done  I love Elizabeth’s wonkiness   Now I live Joe’s mastery of politics and ability to assemble a winning team.
After that recent argument he had with a blue collar worker I don’t think people will see Biden as someone who unites people. Its not a good look. Why won’t Biden bail out so that Bernie can win the primary?

Lots of Russian bots in /r/politics. They are just trying to cause division.
Stay safe! And keep up the good fight.
Hey bud, we are going to get through this together. Be a reluctant Biden voter - I know things will get better for all of us!
Just flipping the switch back to 2015. Business as usual. Republicans break things, Democrats restore order, only for Republicans to break things worse. Nothing ever changes.
Ditto. I'm pretty disgusted at the lack of courage by the populace. I'm not looking forward to more of the same. Trump definitely has to go tho
Joe is not for legalizing marijuana. He still considers it a gateway drug. I don't know much about his other policies.
You don't need me to tell you all of Joe Biden's positions, look them up.  Read them for yourself and make a decision.  You need to weigh the differences between Biden and Trump and decide which one of those two candidates aligns with you the most.  Compromising is not a weakness.  It's a strength.  Best of luck!
If your friends can’t  see a clear difference between Trump and Biden then I would say they are completely uninformed.

1. That is insane, Joe Biden is a decent, honest person.   2. Joe Biden is a thoughtful, intelligent, person.    Neither of these are issues and never will be.
Sure, if Bernie wins I will vote for him and work to get others to vote for him in November! Will you pledge the same if Joe wins the nom?
If Bernie gets the delegates, he's my candidate. I was a Warren girl and now I am with Biden.
Joe supports the second amendment.
For an antidote to the union thing, have a look at his SC speech to the Pastor who lost his wife in the shooting, he remembers the names of people he visited a year or two back and is careful with the details.
SCOTUS is a reason to vote in November. It’s likely that whoever wins will get to replace RBG and possibly Breyer. If that person is Trump and we end up with a 6-3 or 7-2 conservative majority, it will close the door to progressive policies for 30-40 years. How much progress do you think we’ll be able to make on healthcare or climate change if the court nullifies every law we pass?  For me, enacting Biden’s platform is a starting point to tackle our problems, not an ending point. There will still be a lot of hard work left to do. But even if SCOTUS appointments were literally the only thing he accomplished his entire term, that’s still reason enough to vote for him.
The dude who works out 5 times a week and could kick most of our asses in either a debate or an MMA match ? Ok, Sleepy it is.....
Everyone should make up their own mind about who to vote for. But the day after the election....no matter who wins...we need to continue that work to make whoever the nominee is a better person. Democracy only exists if we work to keep it.
It's because some people prefer overall platform that Joe brings. That being said, when more Bernie supporters join us, they can help push Joe to adopt some of the issues that perhaps we can all move together with.
Scottie Pippen made Michael Jordan a better basketball player.    Doesn't mean I think Scottie  was better tho.
Twitter is awful and for the most part we try to be fair to all and not to invent problems with other candidates or do the "Gotcha" on them and take a quote out of context.
Former Warren supporter and fellow progressive here. I’m ready to get in the trenches and fight shoulder to shoulder with you, and I know I’m not the only one. We share the same goals, even if we disagreed about who could best achieve them.   Joe wasn’t my first (or my second or third) choice, but he’s who we have. Now we need to hold his feet to the fire to ensure our values are represented in his administration.
One candidate to bind them, and through the primaries, unite them.
Getting shouted at about NRA lies doesn’t require thoughtful handwringing. Joe was right to put him in his place.
The Republican party is hell bent on destroying this country so until they break away from their far right extremist ideology I'll be voting against them every step of the way
Trump hasn't helped at all...things are worse, not better.
Honestly? Maybe at local/state levels this line of thinking is okay. It's super sad this isn't the case, but damn near everything is tied to party line voting, so really you are somewhat forced to decide which party is in your best interest, and vote along with that party. Yay democracy...  Also for the tail end of your comment, care to elaborate? I do not mean this sarcastically or with intend any malice, I'd simply like to know why you support Trump, since I have a hard time wrapping my head around it.
I've only heard of "Bernie Bros." It wouldn't surprise me that, if they exist, some of them were Russian agents. No blanket statements like "all are Russian agents," but definitely some. I've only heard of these bro people secondhand.
Team Biden should start informing people then
Also, my generation grew up in the Bush era, so it's like yeah, we all know Trump belongs in prison but at the end of the day he's not really anything new or shocking to a lot of young people
There are indeed videos of Joe being very inappropriately handsy. Your first point did not address or explain anything at all.
I'll vote for Joe, but I don't have to like it
I own “assault weapons”.  What part of shall not be infringed do people not get.  You can’t support the second amend any and try to currtailit.  When Anderson Cooper asked if they would take our guns his reply was “Bingo”.  No he doesn’t support the send amendment.  He supports a narrow version of it.  I don’t care what someone else’s state dos with their gun laws because that’s a choice to live there.  The federal government needs to stay out of it.  I’m fine with back ground checks that are processed in a timely manner being mandatory.  The “gun show” loophole isn’t real.  What gun owners refer to it as is face to face transactions.  I’m fine with that ending and requiring a transfer through an FFL.  Heck I’m fine with all assault weapons being transferred to rolls NFA and regulated the same way that machine guns, short barreled rifles and suppressors are.  It’s how they got illegal machines guns into a form a control on the 60’s or 70’s via amnesty.  But no Joe doesn’t support the second amendment.  The second amendment wasn’t put their to hunt, it was put there by a rebellious group that founded our country.  I don’t believe we need to as armed as the military but Indo believe the intent is met by us having the right to be as armed as those that police us.  Most law enforcement I know feels the exact same way.    Joes opinion changes as the polls change, that’s not character that’s a serious lack of a spine.  His encounter with that worker is not going to get better as people see how easy it is to make him fly off of the handle.  Soon they will hide him like they did Clinton.  No press conferences, limited speaking etc.
I just don’t understand why anybody thinks Biden would oppose a conservative appointment to begin with  His [personal history](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yw8zy7/of-course-joe-biden-supported-a-republican-in-a-dollar200k-speech) is not so encouraging to progressives in the first place
Why prefer Joe Biden's platform?
Even as a very anti-Joe Yang supporter, his fiery moments never bothered me. I think they're blown out of proportion. The D nominee will have to argue against outright lies on the road, in debates, and during interviews. That's what I didn't like about Hillary, she didn't fight against his lies.
On what topic
There are a ton of Bernie supporters on Reddit. Makes sense since demographic is younger here. However over past month the upvotes have been crazy on anything Sanders related as well as downvoted for anything on any other candidate. We are talking like 20k-60k+ upvotes and to front page. Similar to /r/Donald before which turned out to be bots

Great! Let’s get Trump out 🎉
I too disagree with his history. But he isn’t going to be a senator deciding whether to support or oppose a republican appointee. He will be the one making the appointment. And I just don’t believe that he would needlessly antagonize the entire democratic party by appointing a conservative justice. Even if the person he appoints isn’t as liberal as you would prefer, there is an enormous difference between a center-left justice and a justice groomed by the federalist society and the republican judicial pipeline. Don’t kid yourself otherwise.
Because I prefer incremental improvements over a wholesale change. I'll take healthcare reform as an example - if we can start from scratch, some sort of a single payer option would be best. However, we have an existing model that doesn't work well but still a large and entrenched model.  Do a thought experiment - if we flip the switch on tomorrow and make Medicare-for-All the law, what happens to existing infrastructure? What happens to all the industries that exist to support the current system?  You may say that you don't care about these executives who care compensated handsomely but these industries have folks who are like you and I - making ends meet one paycheck at a time.  Why not expand ACA to include a public option? Why not make for-profit private insurance providers compete against Medicare to bring the cost down and create a transition plan to single payer?  Another example - making 4 year universities free. Here's the reality, not everybody benefits equally from 4 years of higher education. Some folks benefit from trade schools, some folks benefit from Associate's, etc. If you desire higher education and not have money, why is it wrong for government to suggest that take 2 years of education at a community college (for free) and transfer to a 4 year university after that's completed? You can certainly choose to take loans or go to schools that are willing to provide scholarships but that should be on you not on the government.  Let me know if you have any issues that you disagree - I can share my thoughts.
Every topic.
no
> Don’t kid yourself otherwise  Oh don’t worry, all I’m judging are [people’s past actions](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/272957-obama-says-his-economic-policies-so-mainstream-hed-be-seen-as-moderate-republican-in-1980s) at this point. “Fool me twice, shame on me” and all that good stuff.
In the time it takes us to get to a better healthcare system Incrementally, millions will die. I do care about those people working paycheck to paycheck in the insurance industry. Retraining programs would be absolutely necessary and this is a part of Sanders' transition process. The fact is most people in the insurance industry are just as well suited for any other generic office job.   Society benefits as a whole when more people have disposable income. Besides many states already offer exactly what Biden's two years of community college program is. Most college graduates aren't wealthy they're working class. Additionally, Sanders' plan pays for vocational training in addition to free college.
I mean, if you don’t think putting two more Sotomayors on the court is worth fighting for, or at least voting for, then I don’t know what to tell you. Stay home in November and best of luck getting M4A or GND past Kavanaugh 2.0 and 3.0. I’m sure spending two generations having the court overturn everything you care about and fight to enact will be less frustrating than having to vote for someone you don’t like.
Between the public option and the larger Obamacare subsidies, Biden’s plan will help people with bad or no insurance have access to healthcare. There are many ways to skin a cat.  Meanwhile people would die from lack of care while M4A gets stuck in Congress.
I did a quick search - the number of people who die due to lack of health insurance is more like 50K per year. However, let's put that aside - perhaps even a single person dying due to lack of health insurance is not acceptable. Can you explain why augmenting the ACA with Public Option is not an acceptable choice for you? That gets us to universal coverage as does Medicare-for-All.  As far as society benefiting when more people have disposable income, not everybody benefits from higher education at the same level. Some folks are better suited for building complex scientific models and some folks are better suited for creating delicious meals. Providing wholesale free education will create distortion in the market where people who won't benefit as much will select themselves into higher education when they can be served better elsewhere. But let's agree that making community college is a no brainer - just because some States do it doesn't mean that it doesn't need to become available across all States.
Millions more will die if trump is relented
I’m slowly reaching the point where I have nothing to lose, anyway. One of my best friends was recently evicted  But thanks for your concern
The "We can only support Donald Trump" clip widely shared online was maliciously edited. Here is the REAL clip.
Is no one going to point out the irony of how a speech talking about the dangers of constant attacks on one another... was manipulated into an attack piece. They literally do not listen, do they?
It's crazy the type of edited smear attacks against Biden right now.
The people producing these videos should be condemned by both campaigns. If you don't care about lying to win you are no better than donald trump.
Is anyone here actually shocked tbh
I hope joe smashes Michigan then blows off Bernie moving forward.   No more debates, no more interaction with Bernie - just assume the presumptive nominee position and talk to voters nationally. Do town halls in intimate settings, get out your surrogates to rallies.  Wipe Bernie off your shoe, the only thing indulging him after Michigan does is drag this out longer. It’s time to unite, most of us did this last Sunday.
not sure is bernie bros or russians hmmmm
Like, do the people sharing the edited clip *really* think that Joe Biden is saying he supports Trump?  What universe do they live in, where a single person would look at this and completely forget that Joe is actively running to replace Trump?
Ahh god. More filthy tactics from the same folks who cut down his speech about starting out as a senator to pretend he is confused and thinks he is NOW running for the senate.
Are you kidding? Ugh. Reddit thinks its so much smarter than everyone else but it falls for the same stupid shit everyone else does.
Both sides, Bernie and Trump, unfortunately do literally anything to attack the opposite. Is that the change we are looking? Is that what is called ‘anti-establishment’? Before going for change, look what you are getting into. World envisioned by ANTIFA/Bernie Bros is downright scary.

Lots of deleted and negative comments in here.  This the target of some bots or just a brigade? 🤔
Thanks for sharing, I dont live in the US or support Biden (BernieBro all the way) but editing clips of him like this to go against him is disrespectful to him and his supporters
What exactly did he mean I’m a bit lost?
The story that the media isn't covering is WHY Joe Biden is succeeding and why all of the smears against him have failed. In the Disinformation Age, people are holding on to what they know is true. The Swiftboat Party has failed to make a dent in Joe's support and they won't.
You can clip this speach of Biden in a lot of ways by including and leaving out different parts. Some of the clips only shows Biden stumbling over his words and do not include when he gets to the final message that he is trying to convey. That is disingenous. This clip only shows the final message and not him stumbling over his words, which is also equally disingenous.  If you want to conclude yourself, watch the whole speech, not some 10 or 20 sec clip specifically cut to portray him in a negative or positive way.
Donald Trump literally retweeted the doctored clip.  Boy has he dragged down the office of the presidency.  What an embarrassment.
Anyone got a link to the whole speech?
It’s a different segment of the speech. It is not edited. Seriously, don’t listen to me... go Watch both. I will post if I can.
[removed]
It must be quite hard to be a mod on this sub because you have to constantly hide/remove every single critical comment, even the objective and legitimate ones
Play previous 30 seconds.
He is so eloquent! I can't wait until he speaks circles around Trump during the debates!
[removed]
That is only the ending of the clip, the first part is missing where he is stumbling over his own thoughts to create a cogent sentence.
Biden supporters are complaining about videos being edited and continue to do just that by deleting the previous 20 seconds of the video. Not hypocritical at all eh..
Sorry I’m not sure how this clip makes him look better?
[removed]
[removed]
zero self awareness, truly.
I'm all for giving people the benefit of the doubt but the other clip was not edited. THIS is the edited clip. Watch the other clip, the fumble comes before this part. All they've done here is cut out the part where he fumbled his words.
I try not to get paranoid, but this strategy smells Putin-esque.
Good warmup for the dishonest BS the Republicans will rely on in the election, though.
[removed]
These things are probably produced in Russia and then shared to both Sanders and Trump subs
I'm a conservative, and I have tried to spread the word that this clip was deceptively edited. The practice ia shameful and illegitimate.
Why would Trump condemn it? It was POSTED by his Director of Social Media.  [https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1236461268594294785](https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1236461268594294785)
[removed]
This would be his best plan as a Bernie/Biden debate won’t help going forward.
[removed]
Honestly with Biden polling so good I wouldn't be surprised if T_D is throwing down.
You ever wonder why Bernie supporters talk about their insights into trumps following so confidently?  Because it takes one to know one.
Unfortunately, most people don’t do their own research. So if a popular twitter personality posts this - it must be true! Fake news is alive and well - not because of Russians and FB, but because we, as a society, suffer from confirmation bias.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqS4m-8B4IQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqS4m-8B4IQ)     Is this the speech you're referring to?   Do you have access to a longer video here that puts this in the context you say was the original context? Because it does seem to me like this was a genuine verbal slip. Thanks.
[deleted]
Hey, I get the sentiment, but let’s try to be better than he and his supporters.
If democrats fight each other, it will help re-elect Trump.
He doesn’t have Alzheimer’s dude. Kindly spread your conspiracies elsewhere.
He’s had a stuttering problem his entire career in politics.
Not like me.  I’ve never stumbled over words
This sub is in denial. I hate to say it.
'We can only elect Donald Trump if we engage in this circular firing squad'  Which is essentially saying 'we'll end up with Trump again if we don't run a positive campaign'
The misleading clip is "We can only reelect Donald Trump".     The real clip is " We can only reelect Donald Trump, **if** in fact we get engaged in a circular firing squad here, it's got to be a positive campaign".     You don't see the difference here? Are you joking?
Bernie doesn't have a chance in Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina. Aka the swing states we will need to win. That's why so many senators have endorsed Joe, and not a single one has endorsed Bernie, because they know Joe is our best shot.
Concern troll.
Ok Putin 👌
The context was cut out of the viral clip. What in the absolute fuck are you talking about
Right? What the hell is this? The "smear" clip is not edited at all...
Yeah i think so too. These posts pop up and 5 minutes later have 40k upvotes and 10x awards. Its manufactured.
Blue-check Sanders supporters initiated this attack, not Russia. Newsweek has the documents.  Sanders campaign denies direct involvement.   [https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/03/06/the-disinformation-campaign-being-launched-against-biden/](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/03/06/the-disinformation-campaign-being-launched-against-biden/)
Are you getting downvoted for this? wtf is happening in here
Yeahhh I think they were talking about both the Biden and Sanders campaigns.. Not Trump. Everybody knows Trump is a POS.
that is a total non sequitur and has nothing to do with my point. Joe is not a pathological liar and neither is Bernie. producing  a clip to slander someone is not something that either Joe or Bernie would engage in but it's the kind of stuff trump shares on his twitter feed all the time.
I think debates are good, we need the voters to know the candidates.  We know what we need to know at this stage. Joe can pivot to what he’s best at, talking to people one on one.
Joe is a really good debater when it is 1:1.  He ran circles around Paul Ryan in the VP debate.
So it's ok to have debates when bernies leading but not joe? What are you afraid of?
If Biden is not beating Trump, Bernie will do worse. So not sure what's there to laugh
[removed]
People have downvoted me. I'm genuinely asking for help here. Here is the fullest clip I can find (3m 30s).   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUhLeAaG9Sk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUhLeAaG9Sk)     Of course I don't think that Biden thinks he is now running for Senate, but it's not at all clear to me what he's trying to say in that particular portion of the speech.
There were BERNIE WINS CALIFORNIA posts at like 9:00 Tuesday night.  Normally I’d be skeptical, but I even told my roommate because I figured “there’s no way they’d lie about something that can be proven wrong the next day.”  Turns out that’s exactly what happened.
[deleted]
Absolutely in denial. this clip is honestly even more disingenous than many of the other clips.
Ah got it, thanks!
It took a lot for him to get there. This clip shows how people are editing these videos to say the wrong thing. It also shows that he’s struggling up there compared to even a couple of months ago.
I bet they hadn’t heard the one going around online to attack joe.
What about the 30 seconds before this clip? Was that all doctored too?
Hello? In the “”misleading clip”” it said the same thing?   Your clip just adds the “it’s got to be a positive campaign”.   How much you getting paid for this?
This is shorter than the clips going around and all the ones I've seen included this part as well. Nobody is actually saying Biden wants to reelect Trump. They were pointing out that he was having trouble completing a prepared speech with a teleprompter. If this is divisive than so is the media they said the same thing about Trump in the lead up to and post election. So is it only a problem if the orangeman does it or does it apply to all presidential candidates?
Anyone can run circles around a punching bag.
I rewatched that today and damn. He pretty much laughs Ryan of the stage. Good stuff
Then it should probably happen instead of a town hall?
I agree. I support Biden, but I think both camps need to see him "in action" for the sake of transparency. There is a lot about his alleged "decline", and denying further debate may amplify those rumors, or - and I say this reluctantly - let us see for ourselves if there is any truth to them.   Treating Bernie and his supporters with respect is part of who Joe is and why people like him.
Bernie supporter here.   I've been a lifelong Democrat. Voted straight ticket every election.   I'll vote for Joe if I have to, but I have zero reason to believe enough people will to defeat Trump. Joe is tied or losing to Trump in almost every general election poll conducted thus far. He's doing well in the primary, but the primary isn't the general. I think you're in for a rude awakening in November if we nominate this guy.
He regularly does this thing where he references how in his day, he didn’t get elected without asking for people’s support. Then, in a reference to when he ran for senate, he says “hi my names joe Biden I’m running for senate, if you like me vote for me, if not vote for the other guy.” It’s like a callback to how he’s always ran campaigns by being positive and inviting people in.  The actual slip was that he started to say Biden instead of guy at the end, which is not a big deal at all imo.
I’m assuming you mean Texas?
I love that saying, may I please use this?  Do you mind? Thank you 😊
[deleted]
I’ve seen both. I know you are not likely to attribute this slip to a stutter, but that the words were in front of him, he was catching the verbal error, and struggled to fix it would give you pause.  You are on social media and diagnose dementa or cognitive decline from a string of 30 second clips, ignoring that 1) he has had a life long stutter, 2) he has been known for “gaffes” for decades, 3) he has released medical records in December showing zero evidence of anything, and 4) you are not professionally trained to diagnose a complex mental disorder based on YouTube clips.
Hey I always want more Joe.  The more he speaks the more I like him.
I watched the Ryan debate today to see if Biden is any different now. I didn't notice any differences when compared to recent debates or speeches. I mean he was stuttering a fair bit as he destroyed Paul Ryan and laughed him off stage so that is nothing new.
But he hasnt treated us with respect. Hes been dismissive of us.
Bernie got wiped out in states he handily won in 2016 and he might literally get zero votes in Florida  Every recent poll shows Biden polling better than him in key state matchups against trump - like AZ   You’re narrative is shot, people voted and we have real actual results to point to, not hypotheticals and theories. Bernie got his ass kicked in places he needs to win. What’s to say
Thank you for actually trying to explain this rather than downvoting. It seems like if this is a remark he makes often, it's more likely that he didn't properly set up the fact that he was hearkening back to his days campaigning for Senate.     I'm from the UK, my main priority is Trump not getting re-elected, I think he's a disaster. I would like Bernie to win, but it seems like Biden is most likely to win. I urge Democrats to recognise the fact that he \*is\* going to be hit on this, that this narrative is developing, and to try to avoid as far as possible anything that can be taken out of context. Lies and smears are unfortunately an inevitable part of democratic politics in the 2020s, but there are ways to combat disinformation and reduce the ammunition your opponents can use against you, and just pretending it's not an issue or a narrative that will be used against Biden is not going to help all that much.
I’m aware that Bernie won the California primary
So then post the full clip this one is edited too lol. I watched his whole speech he also lost his cool and started yelling at someone in the audience. How is he going to unite the country if he can't take any criticism?
I've watched most of the debates as well it's not just one off things. All I'm saying is the media spent many many hours attacking Trump for the same stuff and now that Biden is the media darling there is not one mention of his issues. I thought the Republicans were  supposed to be the hypocrites.
Sorry I don't see it.  Joe says he has respect for Bernie and his supporters, but disagrees with the approach they are taking.  That isn't dismissive.  I think we all have very similar goals, but the difference is in the way to go about getting to better healthcare, etc.
I’m sure Joe’s team is strategizing for it, but it seems like a weak attack. He had a stutter his whole life and sometimes it trips him up. Trump has made far far worse gaffes (and downright lies) than Joe.
Well, your first post left that open for interpretation.
538 shows Biden at a 94% chance of getting a delegate plurality, and a 88% chance of a majority!
Don't get complacent. Also, don't be a dick to other people about this. Yes, it would feel good. Yes, others have been obnoxious.  But this campaign is about unity, compassion, and taking the high road.
I can’t find one 538 post in r/berniesanders at all.   What’s going on? /s
The thread on r/politics is one of acceptance. I think we're all gonna be alright kids.
Bernie isn't done yet we need to keep the momentum going and next Tuesday
Having been with Biden since the beginning, it feels soooo good that other people are starting to see what I saw in him
*throws confetti* my work here is done.
Long way to go..bernie aint going down easy..
Right, we still need to show up. The margins between Biden and Bernie in a lot of Super Tuesday states were super thin. It only takes a few people staying home next week to shift the tide.
Agreed on all that.  Especially on not being complacent. I believe part of the reason why many didn't go out to vote for Bernie this past Tuesday was because they thought he had it in the bag already.  Keep publicize, keep sharing Joe's message, and go vote!
Honestly I think the perception that he's already won will help him. People like to vote for a winner. People who have just left Bloomberg and Warren see the narrative that everyone is uniting around Joe and it makes their choice easier. We should not be complacent about the general election though, that really helped nail the coffin for Hillary..
It's important to establish the unifying message as the one the party unequivocally wants. This is the time to show up and vote. Every primary matters no matter how late and no matter if things are "wrapped up". It's about sending a message that division is not tolerated in the democratic primary.
Yeah, it's just nice to see our hard work paying off. We still need to get out and vote, the primaries aren't over till June.
Nor is it in r/politics.
That's because most Sanders supporters are in r/SandersForPresident
[removed]
I've been very pleasantly surprised. However, the vocal minority will get very vocal soon, if 2016 repeats itself this primary.
all-in for joe now, but i think many of us still saw more in the candidates we previously supported. happy they brought us together to one candidate though!
Honestly he's such a sore loser... Just saying I remember from 2016!
I'm ready to go to the polls for Joe in late April during the "Acela Primary", if my vote is still needed by then. We're in this one together.
I don’t think the entire party is ever going to unify around a candidate like the Republican Party does. Lefties care about voting for their values over intra party unison. And even though there is more people voting for electability over policies/ideals this year, I think that’s more just the more centerish dems finally unifying on Biden. Even if progressives were willing to vote electability over values, Bernie bro’s refuse to believe Biden has better electability in the general even as he extinguishes the bern in the primary. Forget even the primary, I’m worried about progressives being willing to unify in the general.

Anyone with half a brain will vote for the alternative to Trump. I don't think it's a concern.
What do you mea- ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Holy fuck a majority of the comments at positive and highly upvoted.  Did the Russians give up?

Right, just like in 2016
Well, it's a different situation here. The democratic nominee won't be someone with 20+ years of a republican smear campaign working against them. Biden is generally well liked (even by Republicans).
The Disinformation Campaign Being Launched Against Biden - There is no data to support the allegation that he is in cognitive decline.
"A stutter does not get worse as a person ages, but trying to keep it at bay can take immense physical and mental energy. Biden talks all day to audiences both small and large. In addition to periodically stuttering or blocking on certain sounds, he appears to intentionally not stutter by switching to an alternative word—a technique called “circumlocution”—­which can yield mangled syntax. I’ve been following practically everything he’s said for months now, and sometimes what is quickly characterized as a memory lapse is indeed a stutter."
I grew up in Delaware. I’ve seen this man speak for 30 years. He’s occasionally done this for decades. It ain’t new.  I still support Joe.
Man's gotta stutter, it's a 100% natural disability.   I got stuck with non cancerous bone tumors which shred my muscular structure and nervous system.  I'll take Joe any day of the week.
These assholes are trying to do what they did to Pete.  Smear with seemingly-plausible bs.
This kinda stuff just makes me yawn. The only person with serious cognitive impairment is sitting in the WH, eating a cheeseburger or gone golfing.
I wonder if they're also pointing to a couple of weeks ago when he said he was running for U.S. Senate. I know there was an explanation for it, like he was calling back to the days when he was there to ask for their support, but out of context it did look weird at the time.  Either way, the bros gotta bro. That's their only tactic. Smear, lie, and berate.
"As for speaking, again, it's true I have an impediment. But isn't what a man says more important than how long he takes to say it?"   \- *I, Claudius,* by Robert Graves
Jokes on them, I'll vote for him anyway.
They’re mocking his speech impediment   It’s sort of disgusting tbh
Meanwhile, Bernie gets on the wrong plane, makes tons of mistakes, has tons of senior moments, recently had a heart attack, is the oldest candidate in the race, and so on. If we didn't want candidates acting like seniors, maybe we should not have chosen the opposition to Trump, the oldest president ever being even older than him Joe and Bernie.
I’m from Delaware and he speaks like a Delawarean. We tend to be very proverb and adage heavy in our speech patterns and often at a rapid pace jumbling words together. When he speaks, he just sounds like a local to me.
It's one of the most offensive things that keeps coming up on /politics.  They did the same to Hillary
We live in the age of headlines unfortunately. That’s why whenever applicable I try to paste quotes to my sources on reddit because I know there’s a better than average chance someone isn’t going to read something because (sadly) most people under the age of 40 can’t be bothered to read. Let’s try to put our best foot forward with the Biden dissenters here **and** the media this summer in showing them why Joe is the right choice.
People need to start respecting his experience. No one has more experience. Bernie was only a senator. Biden was a VP.
[removed]
Maybe an unpopular opinion...but as Americans we can come across as terrible people. I’m stupidly proud that Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden are my Senators here. Ron Wyden is a whip smart amazingly forward thinking liberal. Ron Wyden also has a lisp—99% of Oregon doesn’t care about it because he is a once in a generation Senator. Could Ron Wyden ever run for President though? Absolutely not. He’d be ostracized mercilessly for his speech defect like Biden is and people would laser focus on that as “clearly he isn’t fit for office” when it simply isn’t true. The borderline discrimination against Joe (especially from “our side”) honestly saddens me.
Bernie Sanders supporters have become the new Trump supporters. Honestly how the hell are we going to unite after all their attacks? Republicans are literally grabbing popcorn. Every dirty attack and trick that they wanted to do, has already been done by Bernie Sanders and his supporters.
I have PTSD from several traumatic events.  I can't say for certain, but I suspect Joe also suffered from PTSD through the many tragedies he has experienced.   Sorry for your pain, but the public option will hopefully help you with healthcare costs WHEN Biden wins and we take back the Senate also.
Biden's dumps are more intelligent than Trump
Say the same thing for 40 years muscle memory kicks in.
Yeah, it's totally stupid. Joe has more experience than Bernie and Trump combined. This is an insane argument. Obama picked Biden because Biden has always polled well with working Americans.
A one year age difference really isn't that big of a deal.
Do you have a list of sources I could point to?
People under the age of 40 can't be bothered to read? That's nonsense and you know it. There's just as many older folks who don't actually read the article or worse just watch Fox news to stay informed
I have a stutter, and while a lot of people think of it as just repeating like saying “t-t-t” or something, for me I have to stop and replace words or else it gets really bad. I think he does the replacing thing too, just my take.
Coming from someone (u/Titus_1024) that said Joe Biden is like R/ihadastroke, pretty sure you're trolling.
You're trolling on this sub. Report and move on.
Different folks use different strategies. I lose all short term memory of a conversation if I'm interrupted in the middle for more than a couple of seconds due to an illness that affects my brain , I also can't word find very well and often THINK I've got the right word when it's actually a slightly inappropriate (potentially offensive to the person I'm talking to) *almost* synonym.   Some folks with my condition just do long pauses or talk super slowly and slur. Some use very short sentences and act a bit terse in order to keep things concise.   I institute small pauses and lengthen the end of words to buy myself time to queue up my next phrase.   Biden has spoken before about different techniques to address a stutter and obviously there must be then different presentations from folks with the condition because they have learnt different strategies
Ron Wyden has a speech defect? I'm also an Oregonian lol
You can be King of England with a speech impediment though.
I'm originally from OH, now in MD and *I* love Ron Wyden
Yeah, you have a crazy system. You throw a talent show to decide to whom you dole out the drone assassination privileges and nuclear launch codes.   Finland, where I am from, had a president with a rather severe speech impediment: she couldn't pronounce r- v- or l-sounds, and had trouble with basically any consonants formed in the front of the mouth. She couldn't even pronounce her own name. President Tarja Halonen came out as pwesidewnt Tawja Hawonen. The right also criticised her for not being a member of the church, for not being married to her partner during the election, for not being married to the father of her daughter, for being a bit frumpy, and for briefly being the chair of SETA, an LGBT rights association.  Still, she got elected for two terms. That is because her social democratic policies are immensely popular. That is what happens when you focus on the issues instead of running a popularity contest. You get free health care, free education, decades of peace... Sure, these things existed in Finland before Tarja Halonen, but it was the social democratic ideology she shared that forced them into existence. Once the people focus on policy over popularity, they can achieve wondrous things.  But I guess the US only knows Tarja Halonen for looking like Conan O'Brien.
Republicans are going to make the election about Hunter.  It’s gonna get way uglier.  I was a Warren voter partly because the baggage that both Biden and Sanders bring reminds me way too much of 2016, and while I’ll be working my ass off to prevent it, I’m expecting the same outcome.
How do you expect to unite and bring Sanders supporters over if you basically equate them to Trump supporters? It goes both ways. We need everyone on  board to win against Trump. No need to alienate Bernie supporters who aren't Twitter/Reddit trolls stirring shit up.

I've wondered about that. He still gets that 1000 yard stare when he brings up Beau.

That does make sense it's just hard to figure out how where "the other Biden" came from. But perhaps I am just looking into it too much.
Howdy! ☺️ And yeah...I guess I’m so used to hearing him when he makes news on OPB that I don’t hear it, [but our beloved local subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/2x98ek/ron_wyden_reacts_to_the_fcc_vote_to_uphold_net/) and some regrettable Googling will show he has a lisp. I was probably way too formal in my comment but a lisp is considered a “speech defect”...
[removed]
None of that is free.
I was just about to say, that's the lady that looks like Conan
>decades of peace  Finland is a neutral country in an insignificant location, and has still spent the last seventy years preparing to get wrecked by the Soviets/Russians. What other conflicts do you expect you would have been involved with?
Most voters dont care about Hunter though. Just ask yourself: why are Fox news and Trump constantly promoting Bernie Sanders? They WANT Sanders to be the nominee.   People really need to start using their common sense. Do people really think that Sanders is going to win the majority of states? They just have to bring stuff like his alliance with Ilhan Omar, AOC, Castro, China etc into the picture.
I'm optimistic because Biden's polling numbers were basically totally unaffected by the whole Burisma thing. Data so far suggests voters think of it as a non-issue.
Trump put his profoundly unqualified children in major Executive Branch positions on day one of his term. His kids all “work” for the Trump Grift Org. The two in the White House have made more money since 2017 working for their dad than in any time in their careers of working for their dad before 2016.    Bring it.
Spend the entire primary running down the Democratic party and calling your fellow Democrats Republicans, then lose the nomination. It worked in 2016.
I uh, don't have access to r/Portland, I'm not liberal enough for them.   I also am sick of Portland. It's a cesspool of extreme progressives and conservatives, the roads suck, and I don't know anyone that even voted for Kate Brown on any side of the spectrum.  Did you see Biden is polling above Bernie though in Washington? Incredibly shocked to see that.  Edit: meant to say polling higher in Washington, not Oregon.

Just keep repeating those Fox news talking points.
Ah yes, because American participation in conflicts have been caused by by acts of violence against America.   You're just stopping the other kids in the playground from hitting themselves and misplacing their lunch money.  It's not like your acts of destabilisation have global repercussions.   Oh, and what is wrong with being neutral? Si vis pace, para bellum.
Thank you for typing word for word what I was thinking.  Steve f-ing Bannon was on Bill Maher trying to incite Bernie Bros a few weeks ago.  If Steve Bannon and FAUX News support Bernie you KNOW they're scared.
Dont be so sure, they may not care about Hunter Biden right now, but who knows what a 5 month smear-campaign will do, Trump has already admitted that this will be a big issue.  Please remember that republicans are masters of made-up scandals.
Joe's really lucky that the public doesn't seem to care about Hunter, because I don't think he has a good answer for how Hunter got that job other than to say "Trump is worse."
Republicans are at their best when they engage in whataboutism.  Bush had a sketchy military service record to say the least, and in 2004 Republicans destroyed his war hero opponent him with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.  In 2016, it was all about Crooked Hillary’s corruption and secrets, all balancing out Trump’s inimitable sleaze.  I think we’re down to the two weakest candidates for the general, and the narrative that Biden used his office to land his son a lucrative and undeserved job will play nicely against the corrupt president who sends his daughter on state missions and gives his son-in-law an absurdly substantive policy portfolio.  Sanders definitely has major flaws, I’m leaning toward the idea that his outsider status, lack of “corruption” cloud, and protectionist trade history would probably help make him a stronger contender in the WI, MI, & PA.
I don't think the roads suck. I grew up in Oregon. Lived in Portland for a good 10 years. Now that I've lived in a few other states I have to say the roads in Portland aren't bad.
I don't watch Fox news. I just don't like that lingo. You can describe them as societally funded healthcare etc, but not free. Are they things people want to pay for with their tax dollars? Yes, and that's an argument you can make. But calling them free is dumb.

Well, I grew up here, have lived here 3x as long as you, and can tell you it is a fact that the roads suck.

Bill Maher is not a white supremacist. What the actual fuck are you high on?

[removed]
Degrees. If the suffering of people of color is less important to you than pushing some fantasy candidate which harms the party and causes losses then yes that means one views POC as lesser. "As far as I'm concerned" means it's my opinion. As far as you're concerned he's not and I have no problem with that. White supremacy runs the gamut from entitled privileged jerk (Maher) to Hitler. I realize many see only the extreme as qualifying that designation, but I don't. I'm upvoting your reply.
Yeah, so you lived here 10 years as a child, so you didn't drive as an adult then here?
I grew up in southern oregon. I lived in Portland 10 years as an adult.
New campaign video: "Democrats are going after Trump. Bernie is going after Democrats."
It explains the reason Sanders support is dropping. Trying to primary President Obama, railing against the “establishment”, no major Senate endorsements, painting SC and other African American voters as low information voters, his angry rhetoric against the Democratic agenda shows a unwillingness to compromise and his supporters mean spirited attacks on the other candidates.
If tomorrow goes the way the polls say, Bernie needs to drop out.  From that point on, he's just Trump's proxy.
That Amy Klobuchar sound bide is hauntingly accurate. My goodness what a very effective ad!
He’s not a Democrat, at this point he’s just sowing discontent among them. Another four years of Trump suits his agenda better than a Biden win as it strengthens the argument for a radical next time around rather than moderates for possibly the rest of his life.
Bernie isn’t a Democrat   I hope Warren doesn’t choose to join the democratic socialists of America  I believe she’s a capitalist
Solid ad. Stay above it all and look like the race is already over and Bernie is just the after thought.
Biden looks poised for a blowout tomorrow! Make sure you still vote!
I mean they're not wrong
The comments lmao, a bunch of Sanders kids who probably can’t even vote spreading Trump level fake news.
That makes sense because he’s not a Democrat
I bet that clip of Bernie was meant to point out that despite all the talk about Joe's gaffes and the vicious rumors that Bernie supporters spread about his mental capacity, Bernie has had plenty of his own gaffes and moments of forgetfulness. (Like when he repeatedly called CNN's Wolf Blitzer "Jake", even after being corrected on it.)
I personally think they could have just used the first part of the ad, and skip  the second half. People would understand the message with just the first half without antagonizing Sanders.
I don’t like this ad. Why even bring up Bernie? Aren’t you then.. attacking Bernie? It’s confusing and not the high road. That being said I’m voting Biden tomorrow
[deleted]
Bernie's attacks against Joe are getting more personal. Let's get out and vote and button up this primary before Bernie damages Biden like he did to Hillary!
I support many of Bernie's views -- but I strongly disagree with him trying to fragment the party.  This will just help elect Trump.    The children that were ripped from their parents and put in cages can't afford another 4 years of Trump!  Nor can the people put in Trump's Muslim ban.
Love how it shifts to clown music during Bernie’s section 😂
This. This. This.
Guy can't get a single person who's ever worked with him to endorse him
If tomorrow goes the way the polls say, Biden needs to just refuse to debate or otherwise engage with Bernie. Ignore him, begin the campaign against Trump.
Don't say that. Don't do what Sanders group are doing.
I'm riding the couch before voting for Sanders, but he should stay in as long as he thinks it helps his message.  There's a lot of folks on the far left side that support him, and I don't mind them having a chance to express that.
I think even he knows that he cant run again in 2024. He'll be 83 even if his heart issues were just a one off. Would he go scorched earth to promote AOC? I don't think so. I feel like if he would invest that much in a younger person with his ideas then he'd have just endorsed Warren and campaigned like hell at least after the heart attack. She probably could have won in that scenario because Bernie dropping out for health would put pressure and concerns on Biden because they're both around the same age. I think his thinking now is that this is his last shot and he was inches away from it until Clyburn made an endorsement and everything quickly snowballed away.
Thank you! You can put lipstick on a pig, but at the end of the day it's still a pig!
I think I saw I saw Bernie "replying", but he was just repeating himself about health care, not replying to the ad.  However, when I went back to look for it, I didn't see it.
I’m 46 years old and a Sanders supporter. I’m here on this sub, in part, to educate myself on what exactly Biden is all about. I realize Biden will more than likely win the nomination and I’ll vote for him if that’s the case. However I’d like to vote FOR someone and not AGAINST Trump like choosing the lesser of two evils.  I know Bernie has a lot of young supporters but we’re not all kids and we believe whole heartedly in Bernie’s message. Some of us are tired of voting for the same old people delivering the same old thing. The system is broken. It needs rebuilt not patched.  Your comments lead me to believe you’ve truly drank the kool aid.   Sorry to invade your sub. I’m really just trying to understand why people are voting the way they are.
I agree. I came away with the message that... Joe is dragging Bernie too (but admittedly not in the same way).
ROTR Joe, c'mon!  He seemed to be doing just fine dealing with Bernie's attacks without responding in kind. This was a bit disappointing to be honest.
I agree.  What’s the point? Is this ad even needed?
"We need to stop attacking each other *like Bernie is*."  Yeah, no sense of irony there.
I don't think self defense is an attack. Hillary went soft on Bernie, He hung in too long and did a lot of damage to her image. About time someone called Sanders out
Yeah same, if it didn't have any of the clips of Bernie it would be fine.
No because then Trump has a softball excuse to not debate
? In this case there's a lot of evidence to suggest Bernie has a very narrow path to winning if tomorrow goes as predicted. I don't see how this is comparable to bros saying somebody who is winning needs to drop out.
If he cares about the country, what he needs to do is try to win until it's not feasible then come together and do what he can to get his radicalized supporters to get in with the Democratic party.  It can be pushing them to support house and senate races or whatever if he wants.
Bernie scratched and scraped through mud and barbed wire, and Uncle Joe just rode in here with his ice cream and his Top Gun sunglasses! /s  Best SNL cold open ever.  I rewatch it from time to time to remember the good old days.
Vote for the Democrats ideals and platform.  We spend way to much weight on one person.
Do you have any questions for us? I should add that we as Biden supporters also need to chill out with the name-calling and follow the ROTR.
Since you're here, can I ask you a question?   Why does every Sanders leaning sub seem to to have so much hatred for everyone who is not Bernie?   That combined with their distribution of discredited conspiracy theories probably pushes more people away from Bernie.
Biden still supports a lot of the same ideals Bernie does, he wants to help provide healthcare to everyone, make college affordable enough to no longer be a barrier to education, he wants to elect Democrat justices, decriminalize marijuana, get the children out of cages at the border, he wants to repair our relationship on the world stage, and he wants to fight climate change. Do you not support any of those things?
/u/AShotgunNamedMarcus I'll take you at your word. How familiar are you with Joe's actual policy plans? I'd be happy to talk to you more about them and why they are VERY MUCH not "the same old thing."
Easiest way to see what Biden is about is to quit believing in internet bullshit, your candidate’s base has done it’s best to ruin his reputation and the reputation of the Democratic Party just to sway voters. I couldn’t give a damn if you think I drank the Koolaid honestly, my party is the same as it’s always been, if you disagree then maybe you’re the one who’s been sucked into so fictional bullshit. The ENTIRE liberal party is progressive, so I’d say that labels and radical policies have turned the Sanders base into a group of ignorant children who insult others to fuel their arguments instead of using facts.
If you are really acting in good faith. (I say this because we've had an influx of trolls lately). Take a look at the stickies. There is a ton of information on this sub and Joebiden.com  You also know that this ad is strategy. And if Sanders' campaign were in the lead I'd hope they run something similar. It'd be political malpractice not to.  Likewise Sanders, as he should, is spending a lot of energy running against Joe instead of "for something" right now. It's politics 101.   Finally, a candidate can have a message of unity against a threat like Trump and policy to help many Americans. Both candidates can walk and chew gum at the same time.
Yes, because candidates always want to gain more momentum by running up the margin, but with how well Biden is doing, he should start the process of healing the party so that the Democrats can gear up for the General Election.
Totally needed!

I'm referring to saying he is Trump proxy
I’ll vote for whoever wins the Democratic nomination. I’d just like to feel good about it lol
What’s your best pro Biden pitch?  If you were trying to convince someone why he’s our best shot at winning the White House what would you say? Also, what will Joe do that’s going to make a real difference for people?  How is he not just more of the same?  Edit to add a thank you for answering and engaging in civil discussion
I can’t speak for everyone but I think that may be the fire and passion of a cause that’s believed in coupled with seeing things in absolutes the way young people tend to do. Bernie is seen as our best chance and it’s hard to understand why people can’t see it. We (at least the older ones) understand that Bernie can’t do everything he wants to without a major progressive Democratic win in Congress. That’s unlikely. But he seams to be legitimate in his passions. His fight for the poor and working class is an honest one. He doesn’t feel like all the other politicians we’ve ever had to choose from. He’s different. In a great way.   I personally don’t have any hatred for anyone running on the Democratic side (with one exception).  I only have hatred for a system that seems to stand on the throat of the working class while giving handouts to billionaires and corporations that don’t pay a dime in taxes.   As for the conspiracy theories?  Maybe it’s because we’re just starting to push far enough left that we’re seeing our tinfoil hat wearers. The right has had that problem for years. I’m sure if you go far enough left you’ll eventually find an “anti-Alex Jones” lol.
I support all those things. I think Biden will bring dignity to the presidency again. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not anti Joe. I’m pro Bernie. This is still the primary after all. If Joe takes gets the nomination he needs to do whatever he can to make sure progressives and the young don’t stay home like they did with Hillary. I’ll vote. I’ll do what I can to get others to vote. I’m not sure how you’d reach some of the more extreme folks in our party if their guy isn’t chosen but we need to figure it out. Otherwise it’s Trump nation. Again.
I’m actually not as familiar as I’d like to be. But I’m educating myself as we speak. Could I message you if I find I have questions?
I’m not going to deny that some Bernie supporters are little over the top. And that sometimes things are posted online that shouldn’t be and have no place in the civil discussions we should be having while trying to decide our nominee for President. But that’s not all of us and it’s not what Bernie is about.  Bernie, when talking about Joe, describes what their differences are. He’s respectful and factual. It’s important to let voters know there’s a real choice here. They believe He believes they’re both a better choice than Trump and support Joe if he wins the nomination. A lot of Bernie’s base are young people that are prone letting their emotions get the best of them sometimes. But, overall, that’s a good thing. They’re passionate about politics. They’re paying attention. They’re getting involved. It is a shame to me that Bernie’s massage has been lost in the storm of attack ads and the misguided efforts of some of his own supporters. He’s really a great candidate with a lot of good things to offer. He’s worth another look. That’s all I’m saying.   Oh, and our party, historically, is not the same. It’s ever evolving. And that’s not a bad thing either
Is this healing the party?  Ultimately it’s irrelevant but just my thought, could have left out the sanders part
But they are focusing on trump too and want the attacks on them from inside the house to stop
I think the point they're making is that him staying in and attacking Joe is doing Trump's work for him.  I do agree it could be phrased in a less inflammatory way.
SCOTUS nominations, progress on addressing climate change and improving healthcare, a functioning justice department, rational foreign and immigration policy, and an end to the most corrupt and amoral administration in US history should be plenty to feel good about.
Nancy Pelosi should make you feel good.  :)   I personally hate these stupid plans they do now. When they get to the convention they all hunker down and write the platform anyways. Joe is about the most malleable guy so he will do what he is told/suggested. :)
Best elevator pitch is he would be our most progressive president ever, and he has a real chance of passing all the legislation he talks about due to his experience and ability to reach across the aisle.   Personally I think the biggest difference he makes is revitalizing the middle and working class. My favorite policy he has is his climate policy, which is interwoven with a goal to bring back manufacturing jobs to the industrial south and Midwest through plants that build clean energy sources (https://joebiden.com/climate/). Also, Biden will (God-willing) be able to build on the ACA and expand insurance to every American. Whether you are for M4A or not, the end goal for us should be get uninsured Americans insured as quickly as possible. As you know, Bernie and the justice Dems have said that they would be happy to get a public option passed. I’m not a Bernie fan, but I give him a lot of credit for working to shift public perception on healthcare. He really has shifted a generation’s view on healthcare as a right. I think once we tackle healthcare, we will see an uptick in happiness and the ability of more Americans to have more bargaining power economically (don’t need to stay at a dead-end job to stay insured). I think when Joe refines this message, as you see him doing more of, he paints a vision of a better future for the very people who were duped by Trump’s promises (“bring back the manufacturing jobs”, “bring back coal”, etc) and brings them to our side.   And of course. Glad to open these discussions. Let me know what you think.
Biden will still be the most progressive president we've ever had, he's running on a platform left of Obama or Clinton. Bernie has a shaky path to victory despite the appearance of polling showing him doing well vs Trump. The metrics you see such as head to head with Trump is propped up substantially by youth polling who historically don't end up showing up even after stating they will. This is exactly what we just saw in Texas, Bernie was polling very well there, many thought he would run away with the state, problem is the youth vote that said they will show when polled, never actually did.  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/25/21152538/bernie-sanders-electability-president-moderates-data  Bernie needs a historical level of jump in youth vote, 30% higher than the height it reached last election just to match the support he losses with moderates according to polling. This is a bigger jump in engagement than Obama got with African Americans. On top of this Biden holds the lead in some of the keys states that Clinton lost   Regardless though, even if they had similar odds to win, the presidency this year, in my mind, it all matters less than the downballot races. Last midterm, of the 40+ house seats we flipped in the "blue wave", not a single one was a Bernie endorsed candidate, all the justice Dem candidates lost their races. Putting Bernie as our candidate means forcing these candidates in downballot races to defend Bernie in their deep Purple districts.   Even as someone fairly left leaning, I would take Biden with a blue congress over Bernie with a red Congress any day, with this we will actually progress towards progressive values.
Thanks for response.   Personally I've been of the opinion that the podcast with the same name as a quarantined sub qualifies as left wing Alex Jones.
Ah I was reading this more as a question of Trump v Biden than why Biden over Bernie. I replied in another comment about why I'm choosing Biden over Bernie. As far as disenfranchising progressives, I think it will be fine when we have Warren and Bernie out campaigning for him. Keep in mind reddit and Twitter are a terrible sample of the reality. There's a lot more moderates who'd rather just take another Trump term than let the country go to socialism, so either way Bernie or Biden some will be lost.
Of course! I came over from TeamPete just before Super Tuesday, so I'm still wrapping my head around things too, but I'll do my best.
So in the last four years our party, the party that’s been working to get Republicans out of House and Senate seats, has changed from whatever you thought it was to the money loving, anti-Bernie establishment he claims it has? Because from Bernie’s switch to Obama being the same company preferring capitalist this country has always needed to get rid of to a great president who seems to prefer the radical left I can’t tell which it is. If the Democratic Party is any different then it was in 2015 why is it that moderates still back the same candidates? I understand how changing ideologies in cultural aspects can be seen as ever evolving but how come that argument works for Bernie today but not for Joe 40 years ago? Even if you don’t dislike Biden you must have knowledge on that a someone who’s pro-Bernie.
We’ve just gotta rip this bandaid off and get it over with. Hillary let the Bernie stuff fester way too long.
I agree with you that it does help Trump in a roundabout way. Many things do, but accusing him of being a Trump proxy has certain implications about his intentions that I don't think are true and I think is not good to insinuate. I don't know if you meant that, i assume you didn't, but people will take it that way.
Not related but I love your flair.
You’re right on all counts. I’ll take a win for rational thought in the Oval Office. Absolutely. I’m still swinging for the fences tho. At least until the convention.
Ok. That might be why I’m having an issue. Maybe I should be registered independent. I identify most with Democratic policies but not all and I think elected officials should vote for what they think is right and is best for the people. Not what’s best for the party. Telling me Joe will do what he’s told doesn’t help me vote for him. In fact that’s exactly why I was torn between Sanders and Warren. They’re both passionate fighters. Who truly believe what they’re selling.   At the same time I understand the need for the ability compromise and get thing’s done. But the other side of the isle isn’t budging no matter what. We need strong, passionate fighters.   Ugh, being a grownup is hard
I’m going to keep reading up on Joe and his ideas in case he ends up the nominee. I’d like to be armed with enough facts to try to get people to vote for him. I’ve been really paying attention to Bernie since Hillary lost and feel really passionate about his ideas. The system isn’t working for most of us and needs a serious rebuild.  I think Sanders would’ve beat Trump last time.  I think he’d beat him this time. Let’s hope Biden can if he wins the nomination.  Another four years of Trump would be unbearable.   I think you’re right about Bernie pushing the party towards his ideas even if he doesn’t get the nod. His influence will be felt in the years to come.   I also feel that Bloomberg’s campaign was less about winning and more about making sure Bernie didn’t but that’s another discussion for another time lol
You know, I only just heard of that podcast last week. I’m assuming you mean ChapoTrapHouse? I haven’t listened and didn’t know there was a sub out there lol. Now I’m curious and a little scared of what exactly a left wing Alex Jones would look like. Karl Marx wearing a “pu**y” hat while handing out clean needles  outside of a rescue shelter / vegan restaurant?
I agree. There’s a lot of polarized opinions here but I’ve also had some really good discussions with people who currently support a different candidate than I do but still understand we’re all on the same side in the end. Also, I think Bernie’s ideas are getting a bad wrap because the word socialism is often seen as synonymous with communism. Bernie and the majority of his supporters just believe that we should expect to see our taxes used on programs that benefit the people of this country instead of corporate hand outs and war. And really, what’s so wrong with helping one another?  Being kind and fair and reaching out a hand to help someone up instead of standing on their throat?  We believe we’re stronger together and there’s a lot of powers out there that benefit from keeping us fighting amongst ourselves. Maybe someday they’ll rebrand that as something other than Marxist socialism
Thank you. I appreciate it.
I meant historically speaking the Democratic Party isn’t what it was. It used to be incredibly racist and socially ignorant. Then, thru the decades it evolved. Just like people do. Including Bernie AND Joe. I don’t hold everything someone said 40 years ago against them. People learn. Opinions change. What’s the point in living 70+ years and experience all these things if your not going to learn anything. That’s called wisdom. I’m not sure what you mean about Obama but I’ll say that I voted for him and thought he served with honor and integrity. I’m pro Bernie because I believe in his message. I’ll vote Bernie in the primary. If Joe happens to win the nomination I’ll vote Joe in the general.   I feel that Bernie’s message is getting buried under the socialism tag. It’s not communism. I think if people listen to the man and truly give thought to what he says they’ll see the truth in what he’s saying.   I’m not saying that you haven’t given him a shot and found he’s just not for you. I’m only stating that, judging by your earlier comment, you’ve bought that all Bernie supporters are radical pubescent cry baby Internet trolls. I’m saying, sure, some are. But it’s a smaller number than you think. It’s just that people give attention to those who scream the loudest. And the loud ones are often then dumbest of the bunch.
Keep in mind he said from that point on. Obviously we all know Bernie hates Trump. I wouldn't call him a Trump proxy but perhaps 2020 Nader would be a more accurate way. Unless at the very least he drops the more vicious and conspiracy type attacks he's been saying lately and focuses on trying to promote his ideas and getting Joe to adopt them rather than needless character assassination.
> accusing him of being a Trump proxy has certain implications  It's what he did in 2016..     After super tuesday Sander was in a real tough spot to win the primary... He would have had to win out the remaining states; which he didnt.     But he stayed in the race and continued to attack Hillary from the left and Trump attacked her from the right..     It weakened her going into the general....    Add in the repeated BS calls of the election being rigged and the "establishment" going after him...     he lost early and he refused to accept that. Instead he turned to bullshit talking points and that was a disadvantage to Hillary.
Thanks! Chasten is a national treasure :)
lol  The biggest legislation in our countries history has always been co sponsored.  It takes decades and timing. We need the left, to pull the right, left. The Gop is in the same boat for their conservative ideals. More GOP more to the right. Its like a big ship and guys like Bernie or  Jim Inhofe are tugboats.  Yanking in opposite directions.
Definitely man. Just reading up and being knowledgeable is all we can ask for. I think either Bernie or Joe would win personally, especially with the economy tanking and a less than ideal response to coronavirus right now.
I don't want to get into too much detail here but the hosts are self described Marxists who purposefully work themselves as angry as possible and seem to hate main stream democrats more than Trump.   They also insist on spreading conspiracy theories about the DNC, Joe's health, etc.    A recent episode even said that if Biden is elected "We are all going to die".
>Also, I think Bernie’s ideas are getting a bad wrap because the word socialism is often seen as synonymous with communism.   Oh absolutely, I really wish Sanders didn't have this infatuation with calling himself a socialist accurate or not. He's effectively made himself unelectable to a large portion of the voter base by bonding himself with this term. I get why he does it, but I feel he has done major damage to his own chances and even to other progressives. Changing generations of American propaganda against socialism isn't something you can just change overnight, you have to pick your battles.
I think we’re in agreement on the history part but I’m terrible at making my point so I believe you understand the impression I meant all history. You’re correct, people change and in turn politics change, but the culture and message behind the Democratic Party whether it’s progressiveness or it’s devotion to a capitalist system or its devotion to protect the working class this Party has always had that message and FDR did it well. Yes, in the ‘50s everyone was a racist but I believe that was where the Democratic Party turned around.   And to clarify, Bernie has trashed on the Obama administration since 2012 and has referred to him as a part of this so evil establishment he titles the moderate wing as. That changed after Super Tuesday when he released an ad that gave the assumption that Obama was or would endorse Bernie. When questioned about it he then said Obama wasn’t an insider and not a part of the establishment (but apparently Clinton and Biden still are).  And to touch on your socialist comment I believe most people in the Democratic Party agrees it’s not communism but if you’re hoping to beat Trump do you honestly believe that the percentage of Republicans that hate Trump will vote for someone with either title? Bernie’s electability is worse than 2016 and it doesn’t help the guy trashes the Democratic Party and doesn’t go out of his way to defend Biden as Biden already has. Between the fake Biden video from yesterday that Bernie volunteers have tweeted to Bernie hiring advisors as Trump does, loyalty over professionalism, Bernie has proven to the moderate wing he’s not capable no matter how great his ideas sound.
Yeah I agree with that.  The most interesting comparison I have seen is with Jeremy Corbin. He can't help but fight his party for purity and loyalty first and completely forget he actually needs to win the general to do anything.  A little like Trump himself actually.  Moving the party left, if the country is moving right actually ends up really really bad.
Yeah but he wasn't doing it to help Trump. He was doing it for his own ego. It did help Trump, but it wasn't why he was doing it.
We love Chasten.
I like the analogy. Hopefully Bernie’s boat can pull a little harder over the long run.
I’d like to believe that but I’m surrounded by people who would vote for Trump even if they watched him set their mothers on fire. It’s crazy how facts don’t seem to matter and if you point out how Trumps policies directly hurt them they just call you a “Libtard”. (Yes that’s what you think it is). It’s really a crazy time to be alive
Wtf?  I’ve seen the whole “Biden has dementia” thing in other places and that’s just sad. That’s unacceptable behavior from anyone on any side and has no place in a country that’s supposed to have free and fair elections. That being said, I do feel that he Democratic leadership would much rather have Biden, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, or anybody other than Bernie. I think they see him as not as much as “team player” as the others. Which is actually why I like him. He seams to put people above party and that’s appealing to me.   I don’t subscribe to the full on Marxist thing either. Maybe that’s why I hadn’t found that podcast or Sun earlier. I do think we should expect to see our taxes put to use on programs that benefit the people. I think that if we spent less on war and more on education and healthcare we’d all be better off. I think Democratic socialism is getting a bad wrap and being cast in the same light as communism. People act like it’s evil.  I don’t see it that way. I mean, what’s wrong with helping one another. We’re stronger together. It’s definitely less evil than a system that allows people to die of curable diseases because they can’t afford the treatment. Less evil than a system in which the term “homeless veteran” exists. Less evil than hoarding billions of dollars in personal wealth while even 1 person on earth is starving. It’s nonsensical to me.   Sorry I started to rant a little. Basically personal attacks on candidates are not cool. And shouldn’t happen. We need to focus on their history and their beliefs and make informed decisions based on facts. And hopefully enough of us will this November and the Trump era will finally be over.
Exactly. Thank you. I’ve enjoyed this conversation. It’s not everyday you’re met with civility and granted an intelligent debate with respect for each other’s opinions online. It often devolves into primates throwing feces at each other.
It was a bit nerve racking to think I'd see an elderly socialist get blown out by a right wing nationalist with goofy blonde hair twice in one year.
That is what he is best at.  We need Bernie's, Omars and AOC's.   Here is a young mayor of Minneapolis, HHH, in 1948. He shook up the Democratic National Convention and kicked the racist out of the Democratic party. Later he made the Civil Rights legislation happen as VP. The AOC of 1948!  https://youtu.be/8nwIdIUVFm4
I live in lake county Florida man   Total racist shit hole and people are just openly racist with me because I’m a white dude so they think I’m with them.   I know how it feels man but those of us on the left need to unite. Joe is not right wing, he’s not a secret republican, he’s a good dude with a lot of great goals he wants to achieve.   Bernie will be in a better spot if Biden is potus, same with all dems. We have got to come together to make all these big things happen
I agree with you, personal attacks are shitty and unfortunately it's been a characteristic of this whole election - and NOT just from Bernie folk. Anyone who was active in this election season early on will remember several other supporter groups (2 specifically - I won't name names) who were horrific, with an honorable mention to a third.   But we do need to talk about policy differences and there does need to be an elevation in how we do that. A lot of the time, especially when we touch first on the things we disagree with, we miss out on what we DO agree with. For example: pretty much everyone here will agree with you when you say "we should expect to see our taxes put to use on programs that benefit the people/if we spent less on war and more on education and healthcare we'd all be better off."  I'm not really sure what my point is, I guess I'm just disappointed at the increasing degradation of our political discourse as a society.
haha. But actually not funny at all.
Ok. You get it. Seriously? What’s wrong with people? (Rhetorical question lol)
Remember BidenBro memes? We need to bring these back!
[removed]
Yes, and can I request a few Biden/Buttigieg bro memes?
I think we need a new Bidenbro meme for a new generation with Joe and Pete!
Now it’s gonna be Pete-Biden memes
Oh I loved these! My favorite was the one where Joe said he would boobytrap the White House like in Home Alone.
I will admit to chuckling at that. I'm a huge Harry Potter geek.
it looks like that sub got taken over with malarkey unfortunately
When Pete dropped out, I found my old Biden meme stash and that was one of the things that made me feel okay.
Subbed. I enjoy y’all’s memes better than the Sanders ones anyway.
I hate the term ‘bro.’ I’m a progressive and the tag ‘Berniebro’ just makes me think of the toxic attitude of many of Sanders’s people, and I’m ashamed of that. When I hear ‘Bidenbro’ it just makes me think of the Biden equivalent of toxic support. I know it’s a different context here.
Crank them out. You'll have my upvote!
What we need is a viral Biden meme again
I don't get this at all but I still laughed out loud and want more.
Hey, how do I get that flair?
Please share
Check the sidebar under Subreddit Info. Click "edit" and you can pick one and then change it to whatever you want. That's how I made mine.
They were all from that sub/Twitter/Facebook
I can't quite seem to do that, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong
I can't either. I'd love a BetJoe O'Biden flair.
National NBCNews/WSJ Poll (3/11-13): Biden 61%, Sanders 32%, Gabbard 4%
it's a Tulsi Surge!!!
At this point , the "establishment"= the voters lol.
I think people are realizing how dangerous 4 more years of Trump can be.  We are also seeing why Trump was willing to risk impeachment to tarnish Biden. He is crushing it in swing states and red/purple states. Bernie in 2016 was a phenomenon of people voting against the prospect of another 8 yrs of a Clinton or Bush.
I care more about state-level polls. But this is still good. Credible pollster as well.
Isn't this the gold standard of polling?
Wow Just saw this in WSJ. What an amazing turnaround. Some political forums counted Biden out after Nevada. I keep telling them...nope you haven’t heard from the heart of the Democratic Party. People keep trolling me thinking I was crazy. They posted that they felt sorry for him and he needed to drop out. I knew the people of SC and MI wanted Uncle Joe! President Biden has a nice ring to it folks!
Tulsi is closer to Bernie than Bernie is to Biden.
Bernie's campaign strategy was tailored towards winning with 30-35% of the vote and hoping that everyone else would stay in the field into super tuesday and beyond. Once that didn't happen, it blew up in his face and they had no plan B moving forward. Had they pivoted towards an inclusive message after NH, it probably would have been different.... but establishment, DNC, rigged, something something.
That’s kind of the Democratic voters way of saying “We’ve seen enough”.
Lots of bro meltdowns in the comments.
Humiliating for Sanders
BS should drop out instead of making people stand in line, spreading disease, just to vote against him.
At this same time in 2016, Clinton was only leading Bernie Sanders nationally by 12 points (51-39).   Joe Biden now leading by 29.
[removed]
Sanders is closer to Tulsi than he is to Biden. lol
Bernie is 29 points behind Biden, Tulsi is 28 points behind Bernie.. this is really falling apart for Bernie.
Am I the only one who thinks Tulsi is insanely hot?
She’s creeping up on him
She's doubled her peak polling numbers!!!
I know you're joking but I wish the media and all of us would just stop reporting on her. By simply mentioning her, it gives her "campaign" oxygen. The poll or anyone's report of it could have easily said Biden 61%, Sanders 32%, Neither Candidate 4%.
Tulsi supporter here. I’m in DC so I haven’t voted in the primaries yet but I did donate to her campaign early on. Sanders is more similar to Tulsi on the issues overall but I’m ready to support Biden in November as needed.
Pretty much
Bernie stans love to diminish voters who vote against their candidate. When minority voters in a state support Bernie, it's proof that he's the best candidate for minorities. But when they vote for Biden, it's just because they're all boomers, conservatives, moderates, etc. Voters can't possibly actually think Biden is *better* for them or the country. It's always a conspiracy.
establishment has really always meant the voters.
yeah, a lot of Bernie support was just anti-Clinton in 2016   (for um..reasons..yeah.  um, no we'd gladly vote for a woman! a woman like Elizabeth Warren! yeah ok)
> and red states.  Wouldn't go that far just yet!
This means state polls are insane for us too.
at 538 its rated at A/B and there are a couple better rated ones. nonetheless a very good pollster. probably a little bit Higher than reality, still a very good result
She is, and so is Ivanka Trump.  I don't want either of them anywhere near the Executive Branch.
That isn't relevant
She lookin like Cruela DeVille
No. But you can be hot and have bad ideas
I think that was her main draw for a really long time, mostly. She's a bit of a MILF now I guess.
She’s very hot.
She’s not hot bro
please leave crap like this out and stay on substantial poltical discussion on this sub.
I mean, I'd like that, but to be fair she is running. She shouldn't be, but she is.
Same. I met her. Very nice and very humble. Not sure what happened towards the end with some of her comments, but I was committed early on, especially during her town halls.
They're brainwashed, low-information voters, didn't you know?
This is a line of thought which I've always thought is just plain weird. I mean they are voting. Therefore they are voters. Thus, they are people who you need to vote for your candidate over the other. You need to court them, not call them names and show zero respect for them as fellow citizens.  I think that this is going to be a real problem for the progressive movement going forward. If they keep alienating people who are potential voters by constantly belittling their choices then they aren't ever going to be successful in national elections. They have to realize this eventually right?
Sexism played a part for sure, but based on the polling over the last couple weeks (and going back to the midterms), it’s possible Elizabeth Warren misread the political winds and thought the Democratic electorate was a lot more left-leaning than it actually is.  She wanted to occupy Bernie’s lane, when she should have been running in Joe’s.
I actually think Warren would have had a better shot if she'd run in '16, but of course that's only in hindsight, and she was never going to.
That’s why I supported Bernie. Clinton was so wildly unpopular and he was the only other choice.
I'm wondering if there's internal research that shows dissatisfied Republicans voting for Biden on November. I know some Republicans in my circle who are voting for Biden because he's at least "moderate."
 Especially since the upcoming states are favorable to Joe
How do you know if it's higher than reality
The months of propaganda are going to lower these numbers in strategic demographics.
I’m team Joe all the way. But yes Ivanka and Tulsi are objectively hot. Or subjectively I guess.
From my pov she is. We all like different types of people so I respect that.
One comment out of like 30, relax.
One of the 3% female redditors spotted
A lot of people did. Kamala, Booker, Gillibrand, Beto, there was a rush of people framing themselves as very left, assuming Bernie's 45% was now a majority, when the actual answer was Clinton was extremely unpopular even within the party.   The party has still shifted left, as Bidens platform is evidence of, but it's still a party very skeptical of radical policy proposals in a general election. Biden, Pete, and a handful of others figured this out a little early and benefitted.
> He's at least "moderate."  This might play in a state like AZ, NC, or even UT but it seems far fetched for a state like KY or ND, no?
because its Higher than all the other polls and their averages. its Just unlikely that they are right and all Others are wrong.
That doesn't make it okay to post shit comments.
you are right, all in all this place is nice to discuss and there are few trashy comments but it could and should be zero ;)
Sure. I think the name of the game right now is covering ground. Bernie won't attract Rs, but Biden might.
Just ignore the one comment and move on. You choose to let it ruin or affect your experience here.
>but Biden **will**  Fixed that for you!
Already has.
NBC News on Twitter: Joe Biden wins Michigan Democratic Primary, NBC News projects.
Hey everyone! We're definitely getting alot more traffic tonight than normal and I just want remind everyone about civility and common decency to each other. We may disagree with how to fix things but it doesn't mean we need to hate on each other.  We are monitoring everything tonight and any trolling, belittling,  or anything that breaks our rules or Reddits site wide rules will not be tolerated. I don't care who you support, let's have civil discourse and common decency with each other on here.
I’m a Bernie supporter and I’ve recognized that it’s been over since Super Tuesday I: The Tuesday Menace. Super Tuesday II: Attack of the Tuesdays only supports that. Fuck everyone on Reddit that won’t stop whining ‘Well I guess I’m not voting!’ I want that clown and his cult of morons the hell out of our White House.
YANG ENDORSES BIDEN  WELCOME MATH GANG!
The networks have projected that some of the mods may or may not be having adult beverages.
Bernie fan here.  Let's band together and wipe this orange, egoistical, irrational, pathalogical, moronic, nitwited, nepotist blob out of the WH. Fuck Trump and fuck him for all the absurd and shitty things he's done.
[deleted]
💎☕️ 🚨 THIS IS A NO MALARKEY ZONE 🚨 💎☕️
Scrolling through r/Politics and it seems like their wasn’t an election tonight
Holy fuck, could you have imagined this two weeks ago?  This primary is over.
Congrats Bideners, this thing is over. Not my choice, but he's my nominee. Ready to kick republican ass up and down the ballot, let's fucking go!
The greatest comeback in modern political history.
Bernie has been key at moving the party towards more progressive goals that are now mainstream within the democratic party and should be commended for that but it's time for him to drop out.   He basically ran for president of Michigan these last 4-5 days. He went all in, he ditched MS for MI and still lost. There's no path for him moving forward and it'll be worse for him next week when Florida is in play where he is expected to get mauled badly. Numbers don't lie.. it's over. For the better of the party, they should all unite behind Biden.
MALARKEY ANNIHILATED
I have a strong feeling that this turnout explosion is a strong signal that Michigan is ready to flip blue in the the general. If Trump were paying attention he'd be scared.
Way to go Joe! P.S., over 7000 new voters registered and voted in MI today! We’re going to band together and bring decency back to our house.
Say it with me folks: Democratic Nominee Joseph Robinette Biden Jr!
I think tonight proves without a doubt Biden is the  unity candidate.
I went from Warren to Biden. Loving that Biden cussed out my cousin in Detroit today and that really sold it for me!
Looks like turnout is going to be around 200% of 2016 levels. This is amazing news for the general -- Democratic voters are ENERGIZED!
Nail in the coffin. Provided Biden doesn't shoot someone on 5th Avenue or something equivalently bad this is over. The last two Tuesdays were supposed to be some of Bernie's best. If they think that was bad just wait until Florida and Georgia start casting ballots.  I am hoping Biden can sweep tonight.
I'm a huge Bernie supporter. Loved his ideas, and thought he was really the only viable candidate, and I still think he'd make for a great president. However, seeing the turnout Biden is getting compared to the turnout HRC got, and seeing the piss poor attendance Bernie is getting, I dont think I can keep pushing for Bernie anymore. I voted for him today in MO but he didnt win majority in even one county. Against my wishes it looks like Bernie just isnt as viable as I thought. I think it's time to put on my Biden cap because anyone is better than Trump. And much to my surprise /r/politics is actually the subreddit that helped me see the positives in Joe.
What makes me even happier than winning the state is the tone of the response in the subreddit. Thanks for being great people, folks.
It’s apparent to me now that Biden is way more electable. People can point out generational differences all they want—the young kids just don’t turn out. I rather put my support behind a dependable voting group than a hail Mary youth turnout revolution.
Man ppl really hated hrc....
How much longer can Bernie hang on?
🐊🕶🍦💎
Remember, Remember...it's all about November!
I did it!
I'm over the primary. Time for Bernie to drop out and end this
Guys, remember, even though this was a contest between Bernie and Biden, WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME SIDE. We all share a common enemy - Trump. He is the goal, and dont forget that. Be welcoming, Be understanding - we must unify, or we die. It is neither the time, nor appropriate, to spike the ball.   Remember the Rules of the Road
WOOT WOOT (good luck mods preventing triggered Bernie bros lmao)
We fuckin did it lads!
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha
MALARKEY: STOPPED
💎☕️
That’s the ballgame, folks.
Wooo!! Let’s go joe! What a great sight to see
YES!! JOE!! YOU’RE AWESOME!!!
Just did some rough math guesstimating based on how the states remaining went in 2016 and how things have gone down so far and it's very feasible at this point for Joe to go into the convention with enough delegates to win the nomination outright without a contested convention. Michigan going the way it did was the first big domino out of the way.
Cool joe
Go Blue!
*Shrug* anything but Trump, I’m voting Biden if/when he gets the nomination
[Bernie and Joe fans together](https://youtu.be/7HXW3gRpnFk)
its very important to win Michigan. Lots of people there
I'm just ready to turn the left's collective anger towards those who deserve it instead of each other.
Ok Michigan I forgive you for what you did four years ago
Wow! Go Joe! Keep uniting the party
WHOOOOOOOOOPPP
As a Bernie supporter this make me really sad, but I will support him in the general, but my god does he make me nervous and he really better not fuck this up.
Finally no more bernie spam after today
Whoop ...
Western states gotta hurry up!
I think there's still more to come from MI:  [https://twitter.com/GeorgiaNews66/status/1237571540260016128](https://twitter.com/GeorgiaNews66/status/1237571540260016128)
#BIDEN2020 #Joementum
Not an American but does this mean I am going to see less Bernie posts on front page. I respect your democracy but I have a strong feeling that Bernie is using Reddit as a tool for his campaign. Nobody would give so many awards for a post where Bernie seemingly saying something obvious is praiseworthy.
Holy shit Joe Biden has a subreddit?
Only 41% are reporting in though as I write this commrnt
[removed]
Welcome Bernie support. I'm a Pete refugee so I feel ya, but thanks for being here. I love my new home and I think we are well on my way to getting the Big Orange Baby out of there!
The irony is how effective those posts are. Convincing a demographic to sit an election out is easier than getting them to go out to vote.
Welcome, Bernie Buddy (won't use Bro since that has a negative connotation)
Welcome!
Hell. Yes. That's *our* House, clowns, GTFO!
Welcome! So glad you are here!
They didnt vote this time so we cant expect them to vote in the primary anyway
I saw that too on CNN!   Gonna be constantly refreshing for a news article so I can get it up on the sub ASAP!
Wait, where?
Gonna treat myself to a Corona, minus the virus.
Gentleman Jack for me!!
Not a mod but cheers anyway 🍻
Right on, brother. Come and take your rightful place among us as we do battle for the soul of this nation.
Based.
That’s right. Welcome.
We're going to beat Trump like a D R U M 🥁🥁🥁 rat a tat tat, you orange bastard!
We need more Berners like you my dude. Get out there and spread the word
Beating Trump has to be #1. Progressives and liberals can have primaries and debates, but beating the conservatives has to be the goal at the end of the day.
Good luck. I’d love to hear all the “shitty things” you think he has done?
Well put! Biden mods banned us from poaching Warren sub, I hope they'll give Sanders supporters some time.
Just want to say, while Biden doesn't support all the same things Bernie does, you might be surprised at how much he has in common. When you get the chance to, take a look at his policies.
From contested convention with Bernie winning plurality to a massive blowout and early victory for Biden.  I don't want to follow any more primaries after this, holy shit what a stressful month.
It seems pretty clear in hindsight that Michigan voted against Hillary. I don't take any pleasure in pointing it out, because there was a \[crapton\] of BS and hypocrisy, but it is what it is. Trump won't have that luxury in 2020.
I still think Warren would have been the true unity candidate, but I'm perfectly happy with Biden.
Ooo you've now got a "celebrity" in your family. What are family get togethers like?
Lol
Whaaaaat! That was your people engaging in malarkey!? 😂
is that the gun thing i saw a headline for earlier? did not click on it before.
If your cousin is like my cousin he will be eating this shit up, talk crap online, then go vote for Joe.
>Provided Biden doesn't shoot someone on 5th Avenue or something equivalently bad this is over.  Joe did say he supports 2A.  Oh no, he's about to shoot someone with his shotgun! /s

i think its easier for people to like Joe than Bernie. Joe is likeable the better speaker and has less  ideas
Really the most successful hit job in modern politics. Fox News made her radioactive.
Yeah...
I have a feeling Bernie will hang on through the next debate, but his criticism of Joe will be significantly reduced. He can read the writing on the wall and he understands that the party needs unity going into November, not division.
Thank you!
Biden can now start campaigning against Trump.
Guys let’s call for unity, I’m coming over too, but let’s try to be respectful
Exactly!   Let’s focus on winning the General!  Elect Democrats to every single office in the federal government that we can.   We can fight about policy differences once we control everything.
If Joe's the nominee, let's do us a Dragonball and lend him our ~~spirit~~ votes.

Pete Buttigieg: "[At the debates] You would see Joe Biden talking to the stage-hands while a lot of us were pacing."
I predict big things for this Pete guy.
Pete’s voice makes my stress just flutter away. I love the way he talks!
Pete Took responsibility instead of being selfish by staying in the campaign like sanders did in 2016. Respect.
Still prefer this guy, if I'm being totally honest.  But he's right: he and Joe have very similar, "rhyming" styles. It's called having character, and it's why I didn't mind voting for Biden on Super Tuesday, and why I'm on board for him in the general.
Kamala or Klobuchar as Veep. Pete as Secretary of State.
Bros said Joe was "nuts" for pacing the empty stage when some other candidates were writing out extra notes or using the toilet during the interval at the second last debate and they are the same folks now saying "they are Hiding Biden and only let him off the bus for 5 minutes at a time!"   The debates are hours of intense pressure and the dude owned the last two without taking a break to write new notes - these guys are arguing in total bad faith
The best of us
Remember the Bernie Bros call him a villain? The dude literally got a Harvard scholarship writing about his admiration for Bernie.  Nothing says starting a revolution like eating the youngest progressive alive  And he didn’t gentrify South Bend. It was possibly the most decrepit city in America that I’ve seen. If 1,000,000 sq/ft of a factory has sat dormant for half a century and turned into a tech center, that’s not gentrification, that’s progress.  But your rat memes almost swayed me to back Bernie. Do your think any of Bros were wondering if their attacks backfired?   This guy will be a voice of progressivism for 50 years
Oh how I’ve missed my bright-eyed and well-rested Pete. It’s so good to see him vibrant again. There were a few time towards the end I just wanted someone to make him and Chasten some tea and do their laundry while they took a nap. Love this man.
Whoa.  I've been told that the only reason Pete dropped was a secret pact of eStAbLiShMeNtS forcing him out.  He just comes on TV and says the opposite.  Just tell the truth. Is he allowed to do that?
Wow Pete is super great.  I really like the way he complimented Joe Biden.  It makes me feel really inspired for November when Biden is our nominee.  The fact that Biden is calm under pressure means he will be good in the white house!
The People's Champion
He is on Jimmy Kimmel this Thursday as guest host.
lmao I had to rewind this morning because I realized halfway through the interview I had stopped actually listening to what anyone had said and was just absentmindedly basking in having him back on my TV again  apparently Pete Buttigieg is my safe place
First gay president, 2028. Calling it here.
His voice makes you automatically trust him
Pete is such a calm guy. It’s one of the reasons I gravitated to him. He’s literally the anti-Trump. Smart, calm, cares about facts and science, and is super empathetic.
Same, even though I've been a Biden Stan since day 1, Pete was always my second choice. PETE FOR 47!
Setaying?
nothing wrong with saying that. he'll have his day.  obama got his intro at the 2004 dnc, all of this could be similar for pete.
Pete as UN Ambassador. Rhodes scholar speaking 7 languages? He can negotiate a new global currency if he wants.
Pete as VP, Klob as SecState, Kamala as AG
Fun fact: if Pete was appointed Secretary of State, he would be the youngest person to be appointed SoS--at the age of 39. IIRC, Edmund Randolph is the youngest one in history, appointed at age 40. He was the 2nd Secretary of State.
There are people much more qualified for Secretary of State than Pete. I don't think he has any noteworthy foreign policy experience. Maybe a different cabinet spot, but not that one.
Kam AG  Klob VP    We can send Pete on a massive world wide clean up mission.
You mean first openly gay president
Or VP in 2024
I was thinking chief of staff but him at the UN would be amazing. He speaks 4/6 of the official UN languages. He just needs to take some time to add Russian and Mandarin.
VP needs to be a Gov or Senator    Needs to be able to reliably bring a state along that they have won in, usually a swing state that the candidate would struggle with.
If not Kamala, HRC ;)
He'd be the youngest person to do almost anything they'd want him to do, tbh. How young is the youngest UN ambassador? That's another one that might have never dipped below 40 before.
Buchanan gang
Right. One never knows....Looking at you, [James Buchanan.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/pete-buttigieg-wouldnt-be-americas-first-gay-president/2019/03/26/0b7b1eb4-41de-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html)
......today I learned there are only six official UN languages
I don’t agree with picking a VP based on election strategy. It needs to be someone that can step in at any time, and run for President when Biden’s term ends. Pete’s the best person for that job.
People keep saying VP needs to bring a state, idk how true that is. Biden didn’t really bring a specific state for Obama. What a VP does is expand your enthusiastic base. If a candidate didn’t do great with a specific demo, they could chose someone from that demo to help turnout. If the candidate is knocked for a qualification, I.e experience, their VP pick should cover that gap. Biden has a bit of a youth problem. He does half decent with suburban women, but could do better. Also some people have criticized Joes overall energy. A VPete helps with all of this and more. In Early states Pete had the highest conversion rate of former republicans voting for him. Pete flipped more Obama-Trump counties than anyone else in Iowa. Overall he compliments a lot of Joes weaknesses. I know it’s unrealistic, but choosing a Veep is not for a state it’s for a voter base.
That would be very damaging to his chances
> How young is the youngest UN ambassador?  43.  Regardless, I think Secretary of State carries with it a bit more clout.
Buchanan was clearly just a guy who liked to be alone.  Now, Lincoln...
Makes a bit more sense when we remember the UN was formed by the Allied Powers of WW2.   5 were the original ones that documents were printed in, Chinese, French, Russian, English, and Spanish. Arabic came later in 1973.
The best person in the entire country to take over is the mayor from South Bend Indiana?    :)    I like you enthusiasm.
oh definitely, if I had my way Pete'd be VP or SoS for sure, but I do think he has the skills to excel in pretty much any foreign affairs role (or any role in general....but I'm biased).
Lincoln was maybe Bi.
Except for those ten years he lived with a male “roommate” 😳
I for one am totally okay with Pete learning Russian so that he can call out the Russians in their own language tbh
Haha that’s fair. :) I can only say that with any seriousness because of his performance in the election as the only moderate other than Joe to win a significant amount of votes. I worry about putting up a VP candidate that wasn’t part of the primary election, because they might not have been thoroughly vetted.
Yes.
He was probably 1/2 bi.
It was actually normal for male friends to sleep in the same room at the time. One historian (I forgot his name) said that the "Lincoln is gay" theory reflects more on our society's obsession with sex than with the mindset of actual people of his time.
i'd be for it just to fuck with putin.
Does he know any other languages that use the cyrillic alphabet? If so, it'd be pretty easy. Russian is not a particularly complicated language (no verb conjugation, for starters). But it would be rough if he's learning a whole new alphabet.
Pete is super impressive and has a bright future but the VP will need to be a women senator.  Harris or Klob most likely.  Vetted and can pull votes.  Klob makes the most tactical sense because she can deliver MN, IA, WI and MI without Biden doing anything.  Harris because she is competent and African American her down side is the swipe and we don't need help in CA.   BTW MN is 2 out 2 win VP.
Talking about Buchanan bro
No verb conjugation in Mandarin either. It’s really not that bad of a language if you’re not seeking to learn how to read too, or to be able to use all the analogies locals use.  Learning the Cyrillic alphabet isn’t so bad. Usually spending an afternoon is all it takes to learn a new alphabet, with some periodic reinforcement after that.
Not as far as he's ever said, but he minored in Arabic, so it wouldn't be the first time he picked up a new alphabet.
The thing is I think biden can deliver WI and MI by himself. I think she's still a good choice just because of the optics, but Joe by himself is a strong candidate. I don't think Pete needs to be VP. He needs to make connections. VP needs to already have connections, they are the back channel. Chief of Staff is still my best pick for pete. Lets him get mentored by Joe alot and gain good management experience. We can pretty safely assume that the VP will be a woman. Just not sure who yet. Needs to be a reinforcement of Joe... not a complementary person to Joe. Particularly as age continues to be brought up.
You’re probably right but I really wish election strategy wasn’t such a part of it. We’ll see soon enough!
Woops sorry, I guess my comment applies more to u/theextremistmoderate's comment then
I tried learning Russian a while back. I still remember a lot of the alphabet, but having no one to practice with makes it impossible to retain.
I think the Pete people are going to be disappointed. It already looks like he has been disconnected from the Biden machine.  There are tons of very competent people who have worked for decades that will be used for jobs like Chief of Staff.  To pick Pete for COS would be like asking the new guy at work to be your Best Man over your childhood best friend and I would think he wouldn't want it. Makes more sense for Pete to be out on his own gaining exposure.  Do you know who Obama's COS was?  Not a good way to build your exposure unless you are one of Trumps road kills.
And I was just joking around.
JOE!
The meme Is solid but let's not under-state how big a freaking deal this is!  Biden's turning out OBAMA 08 level numbers, and maybe even more!  This elder statesmen is calling for a return to normalcy in the US, and we're all hopeful he gets this.
>Jr.  Holy SHIT! this isn't even the Sr. Biden!!!!!1!
Michigan is malarkey free!
And Sanders was supposed to do well here? At this point, Sanders staying in is like Tulsi Gabbard staying in. It only hurts his legacy.
The state of Michigan says "no malarkey"
[removed]
Hell yes, turn out is incredible! Also, compare it to  2016’s county map where Sanders won the VAST majority of counties in MI, seems like most people just really hated HRC. This bodes well for the general.
Yup.  Beau was the third.
What’s ROTR for Tulsi Gabbard could not hurt her legacy at this point?
I think his rationale is by staying in for a bit longer, he can have more influence for pushing his progressive policy at the convention.
She’s a DINO (dem in name only)
This one is for Results, not a Revolution. I wish I could have voted for Pete, but I’m doing my part here in IL 💕😌
It's hard to look right at your candidate's name, and vote someone else.
Thank you for your vote. 🙂
Thank you! Now go get yourself an ice cream cone.
Thank you!!
Idc what anyone says, #13 is for coronavirus
Floridian for Warren here -- and I did the same :) Will be rewarding myself with some strawberry ice cream later on.
Pete will definitely be back. It's really not an "if" but a "when"
RESULTS!
Isn’t it illegal to take pictures in a polling booth.  Like a federal offense? 🤷‍♂️
Pete supporter here too. I accidentally voted for Pete at first using paper ballots, had to go back and ask for another ballot. Sucks we can't vote for our guy, but it's for the good of the country. And he will have a big role to play in the future!
I sat for a moment looking longingly at Pete's name on my ballot before voting for Joe. Time to move forward and Win the Era!
#11 looks like a better selection tbh
How are y'all able to take pics? We wer told to put our phones up in the lobby of the building before we even got to the voting booth room.
Because revolutions never yield results👀
"Results " just means trump one more time or blue trump.
Lol, weed shirt but voting for the Democratic candidate furthest right on weed
[removed]
It really is, but I know that I want to do the right thing and not give a petty vote. I have full confidence I will be able to finally vote for Pete in the future
I’m on it 🍦
I’m a Covid-19 rights activists, can I have a moment to talk to you about re-electing Trump?
Thank you!!
What policy similarities are there between Warren and Biden?
Not quite, at least as far as I'm aware. It's illegal to take a picture of someone else's vote, it's illegal to advocate for interference of someone's vote.  Since OP has taken a photo of his own vote, and it doesn't endanger anyone else's privacy it isn't illegal in that sense. Since OP has already voted, no one can buy his vote by giving him money to vote for (insert name).  However, I would imagine the worst punishment you would receive is 'don't do that again' and a fine. Technically Florida prohibits this kind of picture, and could prosecute you, but as far as I'm aware no one has ever been prosecuted.   The law is unclear in other states. It depends on what state OP is in.  This is my understanding of it.
I’m not sure, I took my phone out of my pocket and immediately took it. Some people still had their air pods in while voting
The "corporate canidate"  will give us results for all! Not just the corporations! Viva biden
If Biden manages to successfully implement even half of his platform it will be great, and nobody even has to go to a gulag!
What are you referring to?
Weed shirt? I am for sure wearing a shamrock shirt for St Patrick’s Day
You couldn’t be more correct.
"Yes, you heard correct. I'm advocating to expand the rights of COVID-19 and Trump is the only candidate who is committed to doing so. #FREECOVID"
Maybe not as many as between Bernie and Warren, but people can switch between candidates who don’t have much in common in policy. The executive branch is supposed to be the face we put out to the world, and maybe people like both Biden and Warrens charisma.  I briefly supported Warren in this primary before switching to Biden, but I’m glad that she will still be in the Senate where she can draft legislation.
Warren is more progressive in ideology like Bernie but she has actual plans like Biden. Bernie has zero indication of how he'll pay for anything except he said he'll raise middle class taxes. Biden has solid, concrete plans to tackle climate change, Healthcare, criminal justice reform, this virus, etc  Even if you wish they were more progressive plans, pragmatic is better than fantasy land. That's one of the reasons why even though Warren is more progressive than I am, I had her as number 2 in choice. She's solid.
Interesting
Have you actually looked at the proposals for Bernie's platform? I'm so shocked you believe there's no path to getting there...it's laid out very plainly. (I'm not being smarmy, actually curious).
Since the polling people openly saw me do it and didn’t do anything, I do not think I will be reprimanded
The man who won 10 states with terrible funding, few campaign offices and only had the support of the people.
You know what he doesn't have in his pocket?  Malarkey.

Taking the money and malarkey out of politics.
Mildly deep fried for extra meme zest.
I’m loving the Comic Sans.
I wish we saw sunglasses Joe more often. The look suits him
Vote here to take money out of politics.
Comic sans is MALARKEY.
Amazing what you can do when you have friends.    Real friends not Facebook friends.
Throw that sticker into a garbage bin, a quarter and some lint is enough
I read this in Joe's voice.
Sure hope it was lint.
You forgot the save-for-later candies. Can't let them go to waste. Want a caramel?
[removed]
It's the shades.   The other candidates put their money into commercials. Joe Biden had to spend his money frugally so he just bought some shades.
Name recognition goes a long way
SCOTT STERLING!... wait, wrong sub...
*The man the myth the legend and some lint
I bet his VP memos were all in Comic Sans.
Malarkey level of this post: extreme
Standing for something realistic also goes a long way
Bernie and Biden both have 100% name recognition.
Jack! How do I change the font?
💥 Noooo 💥
Here’s the deal, Comic Sans makes people smile and we’re reclaiming it for the working class!
It’s the new no malarkey font, so uncool it’s cool now. Helvetica and Times New Roman are the fonts of the establishment!
Get outta here, Jack!! We deserve nothing less than Helvetica

High levels of malarkey detected from the Bernie camp.
Now that my boy Pete is out, I'm gonna need someone who is aggressively taking Bernie down on every front. I like Joe, but I'm gonna need to see some 🔥 🔥 fire!
Yep! Last time Sanders lost by 10-12% (aka a landslide loss) and still repeatedly called for ignoring the 3-1 votes against him by African-Americans, 2-1 against him by Latinos, and the majority of women against him and deeming himself ~~King~~, er, the nominee anyway. Joe need to bring this up repeatedly. What are member of my Latino community supporting the guy who demanded our votes be ignored and overturned last time? Even Republicans have never been insane enough to call for ignoring the will of 3/4 of African-Americans and 2/3 of Latinos. Every remaining candidate should be hammering Sanders on this fact endlessly.
[deleted]
Spot on Diamond Joe!!
Typical bs from bernie..who is a fucking establishment
This is not a very honest statement considering that Bernie Sanders did present an amendment to the DNC trying to get rid of superdelegates, which the DNC promptly refused. When people now say that Bernie Sanders supported superdelegates in 2016 they mean the compromised that was reached with the DNC to have some superdelegates tied to the primaries result, but they always fail to bring up the original amendment itself.
.... Bernie endorsed Hillary when he was out of a path to victory.. AKA when she secured delegate victory
You can find folks of both candidates saying many things. Let's focus on what the candidates are saying and less on what some of their supporters are saying.
yup!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Bernie is full of it.
[removed]
I don't think that's his style or strategy, for better or worse. I think he's always been playing the long game, and knows we need all the never-Trumpers and independents who went to Johnson last time, and that means saying things like he believes he can work with Republicans in Congress (blech, but very smart strategy).
The question is.... do we have room to sway away from the ROTR. Would Joe accept accept a /little/ malarkey?
Good luck taking down Trump with someone who can't even cite the Declaration of Independence.
[removed]
How many blacks and Latinxs did Bush ignore when he took the white house while losing the popular vote? Or Trump for that matter? This comment doesn't really hold up.
A ranked choice system would be way better than what we have now (although I still advocate for range voting). That being said, we wouldn't see it's real benefit until we started using the system on a national level. i.e., just one ranked choice election with all parties on the same ticket.
I agree superdelegates should go. Unfortunately, Tad Devine, Bernie's campaign manager in 2016 (who has deep ties to Manafort) helped put in the superdelegate system years ago. Thsoe who have a problem with it, take it up with Sanders. Sanders also tried to game that system last time to overturn his landslide loss by hoping to sway superdelegates to overturn the will of voters and make himself the nominee.   I don't think anyone is upset over what the majority of the party chooses, and so far that's not Sanders.   I'd like ranked choice voting too, but even more important is to have far more diverse states which mirror the party go first.

Bernie was against superdelegates, but when push came to shove and they were his only path, he said they should support the most electable candidate (i.e. him) rather than the one with more votes and delegates (Hillary).
Sanders was mathematically eliminated in May 2016 (some would argue long before that). He didn't endorse until July 2016, two weeks before the convention.  Edit:  You could argue ad nauseam about rules during that time but this is how the numbers boiled down to regardless of the system you used or proposed using:  * https://i.imgur.com/IzluR7U.png  Edit 2:  The other argument not involving delegates was the number of events that was conducted after the endorsement.   This is the criticism that [Martin O'Malley tweeted about earlier this month:](https://twitter.com/MartinOMalley/status/1225707489385017344)  >I’m quite sure I made far more appearances for Hillary Clinton in 2016 than Bernie ever did. And I never insisted on a private leer jet to go campaign for her in OH, PA, or WI. Nor were any of my bloggers paid by Russian television to attack her throughout the general.
Sanders said during the debates that the candidate with a plurality of delegates should get the nom. Complete 180 from last cycle where he wanted to delegates to switch to him at convention
This malarkey has been removed.
I don't disagree. I was enjoying watching Pete expose Bernie on stage. I don't want Bernie getting away with no hard questions without Pete.
Rotr doesn't mean you can't call out malarkey when you see it. Pete on that stage showed how you do it. You confront, you deliver, breathe and smile. Everytime he almost gave Bernie a heart attack we got a taste of Bernie's true colors.  I need more of that personally.
No, Joe has made it clear: “No Malarkey”. That means none. Accepting even a little malarkey at this point would betray everything Joe’s built his campaign on.
Coming over from Pete, I would highly appreciate adoption of the ROTR.
Wow..... Smooth burn there buddy. You got anymore where that came from because this is some lit material! You're cooking with kale now!
W lost the electoral vote too, but it wasn't proven until almost a year later and the press buried the story largely. They both won on technicalities so they never had to call for overturning their votes, as the slave states did that for them when the Constitution was created.
[deleted]
He never said that. He said the super delegates should back whoever won the state they represent. He even said it would go for him and for Clinton.
That is exactly what I am saying, when he had a chance he tried to get rid of them since that is his stance. Later on he had no other chance to get the nomination other than appeal to the delegates, who are responsible for the nomination. And he did end up endorsing hillary
The difference was that in 2016 the superdelegates pledged themselves before the primaries even began and ever news cycle was filled with "NO HOPE FOR SANDERS TO OVERCOME SUCH A DEFICIT IN DELEGATES" before the first public votes were even cast.   The compromise was to lower the number of superdelegates and they have to wait for the voice of the people to be heard before voting.   So yeah,  I think that's fair whether it be Bernie or Biden to ask the superdelegates to echo the people they represent.
I’d still follow them. But as a text banker for Pete I would like a malarkey pass. Maybe just once a week.... please 🥺🥺
Range voting is a voting method where voters are essentially asked to score candidate. It's hard to explain how it's better, but this website does a really good job of explaining it, https://rangevoting.org/. Once all the scores are taken, the candidate with the highest average wins. Since there aren't restrictions in how you score candidates, you have a lot more freedom as a voter. I might, for example, give my favorite candidate (or candidates) a perfect score, candidates in the same party a mediocre score, and candidates in the opposing party a low score. With a ranked choice ballot, the divide between how much I like my least favorite Democrat at favorite Republican would be the same as the divide between my first and second choices, even though I probably like all of the Democrats far more than I like the Republicans. The idea is to make as many people as happy as possible, while also avoiding making anyone excessively unhappy.  Edit: Here's a summary of what exactly range voting tries to accomplish. https://rangevoting.org/BayRegDum.html
If we presume his campaign manager speaks for him, he [basically did](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/19/478705022/sanders-campaign-now-says-superdelegates-are-key-to-winning-nomination).  >"Now we can argue about the merits of having superdelegates," Weaver continued, "but we do have them. And if their role is just to rubber-stamp the pledged-delegate count then they really aren't needed. They're supposed to exercise independent judgment about who they think can lead the party forward to victory."
The difference was that in 2016 he had fewer delegates than Hillary.
You don't want Sander's supporters to call hypocrisy on us
It seems to me his manager is stating their purpose, as in why super delegates were created in the first place. Did he stand to gain from the flawed system? Yeah. Either way it is kind of silly to say Bernie is in favor of super delegates with his history of actively disliking them and attempt to change it.
You right ☹️☹️☹️☹️ the temptation is REAL #WhatWouldChastenDo
CNN projects Joe Biden will win the South Carolina primary!
**[Donate! Every donation makes a big difference!](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/biden-fundraising-dashboard?refcode=reddit)**
Not just win but he slaughtered Sanders from what CNN is saying right now based on exit polls.  39% very liberal voters went for Biden vs 30% for Sanders.  That's Sanders's base.
MSNBC says Joe is already 9 points ahead of Pete's delegate count at 35 putting him ten behind Bernie's 45 but with more room to catch him because they have lots more counting to happen.   Obama campaign organiser saying it's definitely two person race now.   Kornacki cited Biden's 85 percent favourable rating vs low 11 percent unfavorable against Bernie on 56 favourable 34 unfavorable and said Biden destroys him amongst diverse voters
So proud of my state right now!  Here's hoping Biden pulls off a 46 county sweep and keeps everyone else under 15%
Not to mention, he has a MAJORITY of votes right now, a first in this primary season, so there's really no disputing it. GO JOE!
True Biden stans predicted this in January.
Well, that was fast.
CNN's John King: This is a blowout for Joe Biden at the moment...This is impressive as it fills in.

CNN's Wolf Blitzer: Biden will be speaking fairly soon
Chomp Chomp, here comes the Gator!!
Great news, hope Joe can pick momentum in big states.
Following the results of South Carolina primary heading into Super Tuesday I quote an article in CNN.... that I firmly agree with.... It makes me cringe that Bloomberg is in the race  " Now that Biden's "firewall" has held and he enters Super Tuesday with momentum, Bloomberg's presence in the race more realistically will have the effect of splitting the non-Sanders vote and making it easier for the Vermont senator to build a big delegate advantage. "  [https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/politics/super-tuesday-south-carolina-primary-takeaways/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/politics/super-tuesday-south-carolina-primary-takeaways/index.html)  &#x200B;  Forgive me for bring up the gloom in such a positive moment, pun intended
Every candidate not named Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden should drop out. Let Biden and Bernie duke it out on Super Tuesday and let them have 1 on 1 debates instead of having warren, buttigieg, and bloomshit interfering with everything
I LOVE BLACK PEOPLE!!  What just happened in S.C. is about to happen all the way to Texas.   The Branch Bernidians are going INSANE calling the entire state of S.C. low information voters right now, which is absolutely disgusting.  Keep donating, peeps!

Sanders supporter here congratulations guys.
As a Bernie Sanders supporter, I came in to say congratulations. I know we have a negative reputation, but sincerely, way to go guys! You worked hard for this victory and it was well deserved. 👏🏻
Congrats!
Why are the polls off by so much? I mean, it’s a landslide win, but how are the polls off by so much? What’s going on with the polling.
Hey congrats to Joe and his supporters.  I consider myself more aligned with Bernie's ideology but but if this ends up being a two-horse race between Bernie and Biden I'll be pretty happy (just... please... no Bloomberg).  That said, Biden hasn't impressed me all that much in the debates - but I can see that a lot of people clearly are passionate about him.    My state (MO) hasn't primaried yet, and I want to make sure I'm weighing the candidates who are still in it fairly.  I want to ask some of his supporters, what do you like the most about him?  What makes you passionate about the idea of Joe Biden being president?  Love to hear some thoughts - thanks!

I think his Castro comments really neutered his momentum, no Florida, no victory.
I think I heard them say that Biden won every county in SC 🗳️👍
Source on those favorability numbers? I can't find the poll putting him in the lead in favorability.
[removed]
538 projected he'd win by +19%  He's currently looking at +30-35%  This is so incredible everyone
Looking like it probably won't be with 95% reporting and Biden not breaking 50%.  Nonetheless, big win for Biden.  From my perspective, Sanders and Biden have both landed very big hits (Nevada and South Carolina, respectively), and Super Tuesday is going to be (unsurprisingly) *huge* in shaping the future primary outcomes.
Yup. People kept mocking me but it was very clear that this was Joe's path. A decent ST and he's so game.
And the Faithful are rewarded.
I had the radio on and it seemed like the transition from welcome to live coverage -> Biden projected winner was instant.
I just checked and it was at 4% reporting. So 96% to go.

Not super likely unfortunately. According to Nate Silver, Bernie is probably at 19 or 20 with Biden between 47-50 according to exit poll data. However, he’s going to be extremely close to Bernie in total delegates.
I got banned from S4P for saying Bernie lost Iowa and tied in New Hampshire (both facts).  Of course their other subreddit would be like that.
Thank goodness. Great time to start.

The Bernie Bros are freaking out and brigading /r/neoliberal right now. It's adorable, honestly.
Whenever some random celebrity endorses Bernie, it makes the front page of /r/politics.  However, when someone with actual clout, such as James Clyburn, endorses Biden, it gets buried due to downvoting.

Yup most people don't want Bernie, they want moderate policies. Let them all congregate towards biden
Please let this happen. It just needs to be Biden vs Bernie at this point. I'm mostly leaning Bernie now but Biden was my pick in 2016 and he's definitely in my peripheral right now.  Biden really needs to start hammering his foreign policy experience. He's the only one with any foreign policy accomplishments or even experience at all.
Thank you kindly - appreciate the outreach and humility. Definitely refreshing in these times.

Sanders will lose a general against Trump. Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan are lost. Don’t be a part of the problem. Be part of a solution to beat Trump.
Bernie will lose to Trump in a general. Remember that.
Biden/Bernie 2020
I think that his victory speech now encapsulates everything I love about Joe Biden more than anything. I don't want a revolution-- I want someone to build on what we already have and make real, tangible progress (and when I say real, I mean REAL). I want someone who understands grief and loss-- and I want someone who REJECTS populism and all that it stands for.  When he's talking about Beau. When he's talking about people he cares for. When he's talking about his faith-- that's what I want in a President. I want to be able to look up to them again.  That's why I love Joe. Always have, always will.
He has a long history of getting shit done in the Senate
Not in SC but definitely in Florida.  People seem to think if you are Hispanic you are from Mexico or South America and think a specific way.  Cubans are not Mexicans.  And then they act confused when a socialist loses or a Republican wins in the general.
That and informing people of Bernie's detest for Obama going so far to wanting to primary him.
Socialists hate liberals more than fascists.
arr politics is losing their mind. It's sad to see that the top stories on Reddit's largest political sub have nothing to do with the actual winner tonight.
Yea, I think I called that one a bit too early. Oh well, I'm still happy with the result.
Being a progressive means making progress. Therefore Joe Biden is the *most* progressive candidate.
!ping DIAMOND-JOE
MALARKEY DETECTED
Crazy how one state can do that
Eh, we’re all in this together, no need to patronize or divide us further than we already are.
Oh man I love that Joe won SC. Time for him to ride on that momentum and get the nomination to bring the party back to sanity. I've never wanted it to be this way, I've always wanted both parties to put up the best they have to offer. I support Trump but congratulations to you all :) I'd consider a Biden-Trump debate stage a victory in itself for me.
Polls don’t suggest so.
You are very welcome.
I'll vote for anyone but Bloomberg.
Do you have any tangible evidence to back that up? Or are you just fear mongering.. literally every poll shows the opposite of what you say. Looking forward to a Bernie V Biden showdown. 🇺🇸
And every single poll shows you are wrong.
“Remember that” lol
Thanks for the response.  I'll have to give his speech a watch.
But the point is people go with electability, and that kind of hard without Florida. The Sanders surge helped him in Nevada because of the draw towards the likeliest winner. This seems less likely without Florida
I'm no political guru, but maybe you shouldn't praise totalitarian regimes?
[removed]
`It's sad to see that the top stories on Reddit's largest political sub have nothing to do with the actual winner tonight.`  How FOX News of them...
Really? Is Bernie over 50% in any poll? How about Bernie + Warren?
Sanders would lose Pennsylvania in a landslide.
Nobody polled today said they cared about Castro comments.  The biggest concerns were healthcare and race relations.
detest was probably the wrong word to use there admittingly
is it tho
You can't just add other candidates totals to Biden enmasse.   Some will go to Biden, some will go to Bernie, some will stop participating in the democratic primary. Some might go over to another potential candidate. Some might even swap to the Republicans.
As a Pete supporter, I just have to say: Get ready.
Automoderator is outta line pal!!!!! This is negative malarkey if I've ever seen it.
They’ve been trashing Biden from the beginning. They wasted their time. Clearly no one cares what they think. Jeff Weaver is a weasel that covers for Bernie when he fucks up.
How is this level 5 malarkey? Oh no has the bot been taken over?!
Well, while Warren is still in the race they are slinging a lot of shit her way too. There are Bernie supporters who are very angry that she has not dropped out. I see people accusing her of being nothing but an anti-Bernie plant because "why else would she still be in the race if not to tank Bernie and swing the race toward Biden?" And I'm like, uh, maybe because she thinks she's the best candidate and wants to be President and thinks she still has  a shot? I mean, duh.  Also I was catching up on 538 and thinking about the nature of the candidates, Biden and Bernie. It's not like Bernie is telling his supporters to go out and be jerks to all the other candidates, but-- well, here's how Perry Bacon on 538 put it  (emphasis mine):  > On Feb. 21 — a day before the Nevada caucuses, which polls showed him very likely to win — Sanders tweeted, “I’ve got news for the Republican establishment. I’ve got news for the Democratic establishment. They can’t stop us.” **That tweet was generally in line with how Sanders and his aides positioned themselves in the days before Super Tuesday — an insurgent campaign attempting a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party.** One question I will always have is whether Sanders could have avoided this flood of endorsements against him if the senator had shifted post-Nevada to talking less about his agenda and more about, say, his own electability, helping the Democrats win the House and Senate and generally unifying the party.
ROTR!  We'll beat 'em at the polls, where it matters.
As a Team Pete who just arrived, I second this. Watch out, those folks are, uh, mean.  ROTR will be ingrained to the point you even become a better driver.   We sorely miss Pete (I mean really miss Pete), but being on Team Joe at least feels nice. I can feel good about all this malarkey. And I made my first Joe donation, so here we go.  Let's win this!
Oh we know. I was a Clinton shorter on this site in 2016,I've been getting harassed for 4 years now. And they've been harsh to Biden as well as Pete (and klobacher and Warren and anyone else who opposes dear leader...). They've been baking Biden a senile pedophile for months.
Good. It will make us stronger for when we face Trump
Oh, we know baby, we know. This isn't our first rodeo.
I love this idea. Everytime you get Bernie hate, you donate.
After tonight, it does not matter. Let them come.  There's no way Sanders recovers from his ass being handed to him tonight.
Reddit is disproportionately pro Bernie.   The Bernie Bros who have nothing better to live for will always beat us in the online comment boards.  You only need to strategically place facts in counterpoints to disproportionately get them to troll back and waste their time.
Oh we know, that's why he is called Diamond Joe. The attacks just bounce off.
Ill be real i dont think calling him mayo or attempting to sway the black vote from Biden will find much success
>I'm gonna donate a buck to joe Everytime one of Bernards keyboard warriors is a dick to me  I suspect that would quickly put you in violation of federal campaign contribution limits...
Genuinely curious, what's Biden's appeal? I'm going to support the democratic nominee if they win fair and square, but I just don't see the appeal with Biden over Bernie, but I want to hear other opinions rather than sitting in an echo chamber.
[deleted]
And sadly, the worst is yet to come
[removed]
Obviously the automoderators sensors are just thrown off by the tidal wave of malarkey that will soon be approaching us.
Reddit recently began implementing a new tool called "Crowd Control" to prevent brigading, trolling, etc. Site admins allowed us to utilize it. I almost feel bad for how hard automod is working now.  It's always either too much or too little, ya know?
The bot got to go!
Can we ask the bot what it's own Malarkey level is?
Say what they will, but Biden helped Obama win and was a great VP. Folks will start to remember, not to mention after Obama comes out to tell us how much he helped
The bot just posted malarkey!
Kinda everyone is slinging shit at Warren. I'm watching CNN and I can't even count the number of times they've specifically referred to her as "disappointing." Like I was never specifically a Warren supporter, though I like her, but this is kind of making me mad. I know that's a tangent to what you're talking about but it's been pissing me off all night.
If you actually care about the type of person that Joe is, check out this interview from 4 years ago with Colbert  Part 1 https://youtu.be/opVaEC_WxWs  Part 2 https://youtu.be/XwmMPytjrK4   He's a good man and would make a good president, and surround himself with good advisors.
His plans for HBCUS (his plan for education in general is actually very good)  Public Option—I want single payer and the elimination of private insurance, but lol at Manchin, Sinema, etc. falling in line for single payer. I feel like there's a lot of historical revisionism or people are too young to remember just how fucking hard the fight was for ACA as it was...and that it cost several Blue Dog Democrats their seats (fuck Lieberman for life for his role in stopping the public option).   'Carbon Tax  Repeal Citizens United  Vacate pot convictions   End the death penalty   $15 federal minimum wage  Trade is honestly a big one for me, too. I understand the problems with NAFTA and  TPP (and free trade in general), but you can't put the cat back in the bag...globalization is here to stay. With TPP, we could have at least had leverage over China....  And frankly, the downballot is a major issue. Progressives in FL were even denouncing Bernie...he had a valid point but expressed it in the most tone deaf way and during the worst time (before an election). And I worry that he can't build coalitions and work with others..the fact that Barbara Lee went for Kamala over Bernie, when Barbara is probably one of the most progressive politicians out there, was a three alarm fire to me. I'm for Joe, but I think it's delusional to try and work with most Republicans...but Bernie's plan of protesting in W. Va to change Manchin's mind is equally, if not more, delusional. Manchin keeps winning by depicting himself as a "renegade" Dem (ugh) and had an ad where he shot a piece of paper meant to represent one of Obama's policies...he'd fucking love for  Bernie to organize a protest against him so he can use it as an advertisement.   Lastly, at the end of the day, the specifics are a big issue. It's one reason I was drawn to Warren at first before shifting to Joe....Bernie has been so vague with some of the specifics of his policies and that's a concern, too.   \*Forgot to add turn out. Bernie keeps touting he's going to turn people out...but he hasn't beaten 2008 even thought there are far more registered Dems in NV/IA/NH in 2020. The place where there was record turnout was......VA...which went decisively to Biden.
I’m curious as well, what policy positions excite Biden supporters?
Thank you for the request, comrade.  errl_dabbingtons has not said the N-word yet.
[removed]
Probably around [3](https://i.imgur.com/T6y2Y2E.jpg) tbh. I find myself approving a lot of comments which it removed for some indiscernible reason.
Picking Biden as his running mate was a masterstroke from Obama. He complimented all of Obama's weaknesses, from being seen as to prophets Oriole, to being too young, to being too inexperienced and national-level politics, and being able to connect with working class white voters better than Obama could. That was an absolutely brilliant pick by Obama. And it paid off. McCain went the opposite way and picked a running mate who undercut all his strengths whereas Biden complemented Obama's weaknesses, both real and perceived.
Greatest anime betrayals of 2020!
I voted for Warren today but I knew it wouldn't matter. I genuinely like her. Pete would've been my second choice. I wouldn't vote for Bernie, I don't like the culture. I'm way more interested in how competent a person is than their exact positions because positions don't survive the office. You'll get 1 or 2 major bills if the stars align and you have congressional support.  Give me the ones that are nerds, give me policy wonks, the ones people don't want to hang out with but care about issues. I'll take Al Gore and Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren and hopefully Pete in some future election because they want to get stuff done to help others.  I'm not great at parties.
Yeah, I don't remember Richardson, or Edwards, or Rubio, or Kasich getting this much shit for staying in the race as Warren is.
I'm really not trying to be a dick here, and I'll listen to the videos but you just said a super generic statement. What is Biden offering that Bernie isn't?
I appreciate your response, seriously. I have some reading to do, but holy shit if any president repealed Citizens United it would be a huge win.   I agree with the specifics being slightly lacking, but I also think candidates can’t release large documents or people won’t read them. Bernie’s tax plan to pay for Medicare For All is 6 pages and I bet that’s already too much for a lot of people, sadly. I’d like to see the details since every study done to determine overall cost are all over the place with their findings.
$15 minimum wage  ACA/Medicaid expansion  Public option  Ban the death penalty  Vacate marijuana convictions  Climate / Energy plan that includes nuclear and a carbon tax, both of which are crucial IPCC-recommended parts of getting to zero emissions  Big plusses also are that he's got support from Democrats in Congress to actually pass his policies, he isn't a divisive independent who never misses an opportunity to attack other Democrats (crucial for downballot success) and can actually beat Trump.
In addition to the things the other commenters mentioned, I'm also really into the idea of having a person with 8 years of functional White House experience be the one to try and repair the train wreck that is the current admin. Half the positions in the government aren't even *filled.*  Biden knows his way around the job already. Significantly smaller learning curve than any other option.
That makes me think Pete or Andrew Yang could be a great contrast for Joe....
I know what you mean. Warren doesn't line up with me the best ideologically in that she's further left on the scale than I am, but I am seriously in awe of her policy wonkness. Is that a word? Wonkity? Something like that.
If she wasn't already having such a rough go of it by that point, Warren would have been my #2 after Pete, for much of the same reasons.
[deleted]
Right? Like I get that she's underperforming but a lot of people are underperforming - to the extent that several have dropped out and Bernie is getting curb stomped. Yet they keep cycling back to Warren and being like "omg disappointing." Like that specific word, over and over. It may be a stupid hang up but as a woman I do notice it and it does really bug me a lot.
He's not offering pipe dreams. Every single policy position Biden has is a positive change for the better, that can be achieved. And I agree with pretty much all of his policies.  Bernie is writing a check that the office can not cash. Among a ton of other reasons Bernie is not on my list of people I'd be excited to vote for in November.   Oh and no Joe supporter ever called me a rat on twitter for being pro Pete.
I get your point about specifics......also, the press...Warren went from being praised for her plans, to being slammed. My big fear is the press is going to "but her emails" to Biden and/or Bernie if they are the nominee. I've already seen it happen twice in the past two days  Bernie: The press framed it as if he was encouraging the crowd to boo Amy, when in fact he complimented her and told them to cut it out. Five second clip taken out of context, and it went on fire and was retweeted by blue check journalists....also just some tweets, devoid of context about the situation, were retweeted. It all seemed to play into the "angry Bernie" narrative.  Biden: During his speech tonight, his wife and sister switched sides behind him during the ruckus with the crazy dairy protestors. He turned around, expecting his wife, and instead saw his sister and made some crack...well, people took a five second clip of it and are running with "Biden confused his wife and sister" ..and I even saw Time, USA Today, journalists etc. retweeting it. It played into the "Biden has dementia" narrative (and about 95% of those "gotcha" videos are also BS when you see it in full and not just a clip).  It's just...depressing. I really fear we're going to fall into the 2016 trap again or shit where the media goes "both sides".  Anyway, nice talking with you and if Bernie wins the nomination I will vote for him
Increase capital gains tax   Repeal citizens United   Get rid of Mandatory minimums   Get rid of private prisons   2 year college should be free   Boost teacher pay   Corporate taxes go directly to infrastructure   Build rural broadband infrastructure   Pull back on tariffs   Reduce malarkey emissions from   Washington DC 10,000%
Can you imagine a Mayor Pete vs Pence debate?
I'll accept wonkness. In a perfect world I probably lean more Bernie but I believe change can only be done step by step. I'll leave the revolutions in the past, thanks. They rarely end well.
Yeah, she's needed in the Senate.   I'm happy for her to stay in until the convention just to prove a point to Bernie.
Oh I think there's no doubt a lot of it is gendered in nature.
I agree with you that overall Biden is a good person, he's said some..debatable things in the past that could question that take, but overall I think he's a good man, obviously a better man than Trump.   I agree that a lot of Bernie's plans sound good on paper, but would they actually be able to come into fruition. McConnell already has how many bills sitting on his desk...  There's shitty supporters in every camp, I think Bernie's are the most vocal, and they're likely among the youngest. I can respect your reasons for being pro Biden, I just hope the democratic party can unite under a single candidate before the election, whether it be Biden or Bernie.
You are being sealioned   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning  Just ignore these posts
I would relish it.
That would be glorious.
Ooh. That would be spicy. I’m here for it.
If I had to pick between Warren and Bernie, I'd end up picking Warren because of her political wonkiness.
The reality is that Bernie has no desire to unify the party...so I don’t see how any realistic assessment of the situation has the Democratic Party uniting behind him.
Pete Buttigieg: Campaigning beside Amy Klobuchar I got to see firsthand the midwestern grit, determination and common sense that our country needs more of. I am thankful for the spirit and humor she brought to this race, and I look forward to working with her to build the country we all deserve.

Oh Pete, we don’t deserve you. Glad to see the competitiveness is just for the debate stage and that they have the capacity to work together like this.
If Biden can bring Amy and Pete together, he can bring the country together in November
Dallas is going to be epic tonight.

Class act.
I guess Amy promised she'll stop throwing office equipment at him.
Just ... beautiful
Moderates consolidated, malarkey decreasing
Love fest on one side, one angry man on the other.
These two went at it, I love it that they’ll be working together
Pete is a good human.
Damn Pete, you classy bitch you.
Pete is just a beautiful little cinnamon roll, too pure for this world. I'm over to Joe now after supporting Pete, and they are both just so sincere and loving that however painful it was losing Pete, the transition just makes sense.
Bernie's supporters may prove a tougher nut to crack, sadly!
Don't forget Beto.  And there's some serious rumors going on the Kamala is endorsing Biden Tuesday morning. Hoping to steer more Californians to vote Joe.  Also, one day I really hope I can use the slogan "It's Beto with Pete" in another POTUS election.
We’re just missing Mike and we’ll be complete
President Obama promised her a Swingline and a clear line of fire to Bernie.  😁
Did that happen? 😆 Lol
>Pete is just a beautiful little cinnamon roll    u/Xenokilla please can this become my flair?? Mods, pretty please.
If you ignore all of the online bluster, you know who Bernie supporters poll most often as their second choice? It’s Biden.  Everyone wants to beat Trump, and I believe that many Bernie supporters genuinely believe that Bernie has a better chance (though I respectfully disagree), but they also know that if not Bernie the best chance *would* be Biden.  There is a lot of fronting in “Bernie or bust”, but if you actually listen, much of it is almost like a negotiation... if they can make people *believe* that Bernie supporters would throw the election by staying home, maybe they can create the reality that only their candidate has a real shot... but at the end of the day in the polling booth and it’s only them and their conscience, there is no reason to pretend any longer.
1 last infinity stone
I swear to God if we start that here I'm going to ban you all. ;)
You are a beautiful little cinnamon roll too! ❤️
Do it do it....
Biden campaign requests Secret Service protection
About time.
The vegans don't stand a chance now
Good. I know he likes to be accessible, but there are too many crazies out there.
Jill Biden can only do so much. Get the man professional protection.
Apparently I wrongly assumed that, given his VP status, he still had that. I thought they continued to provide services as needed after the term was served? Maybe that's just for ex presidents?
So Dr. Jill and Symone Sanders will get guns and badges?
Thank goodness.
Symone Sanders  has been filling in while the Secret Service was sleeping.  >Biden aide Symone Sanders jokes that she 'broke a nail' tackling protester  >https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485864-biden-aide-jokes-that-she-broke-a-nail-after-seen-tackling-protester
Anyone else expect Trump to be Petty and deny this? This is one of those things I could see him playing games with.
Didn’t he already have it being a former VP?
Good. We need our president to stay safe!
This is insane, he doesn’t have it?? Sen. Obama had USSS details as early as May 2007.
About damn time.
For real. I just assumed secret service had been covering them when it was down to 2 or 3. Especially Biden, he was VP. Presidents get covered their whole life. Sickening to think about in the case of Trump.
Dr. Jill can handle shit. Just sayin’
Did they ever with Jill Biden around?
There will be no place for hatred against ice cream in this administration.
*radical crazy vegans  Most of us vegans and vegetarians just want to eat our French fries in peace
But Cory Booker endorsed him!
Some of us voted for the guy lol. I know he has a better chance of getting anything at all done as opposed to Sanders.
And don't forget  the formidable Symone Sanders tackling folks who get rowdy and rush up on Biden.  >https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485864-biden-aide-jokes-that-she-broke-a-nail-after-seen-tackling-protester
Presidents get protection for life, VPs only for 6 months, unless they request more like Cheney did (and was granted)
I think it's funny that he's probably gonna have at least some agents that have protected him previously. It's like a reunion.
You get it for 6 months
‘Get down, Mr. President!’  ‘...but I have a toothache!’
One of the blessings about 2016 and Hillary being a former First Lady.  She already had it.
I think only for like a year or two after leaving office.
They have to request it.  Obviously he thought he was okay until now.
Think of it this way- it would be an easy job. Stick two servicemen in front of a jail cell and you’re set!
Presidents don’t get lifetime anymore. Think that changed with W (either he was the last to get lifetime coverage, or the first with an expiration date). Meh, somebody will look it up  Edit - it was changed to 10 years of coverage in 96, so the first president to not have lifetime was W, however as somebody mentioned below, [it was changed back in 2013](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-restores-lifetime-secret-service-for-former-presidents/) and gave lifetime coverage back to W.
I actually think Trump will hate this. Having someone watching over him every second means no more grabbing by the pussy. It means no more shady shit.  I bet he regrets winning for the rest of his life.
This is the problem with these corrupt oligarchy establishment politicians. The secret service is just going to use nepotism and hire Jill Biden as his agent.   /s
Jill Biden ATE a vegan!
*Foreign fries.
Yeah but he doesn't hold signs protesting milk
No wonder those Bernie protesters targeted her first
He’s already got a nickname.  Jill too.
From your lips to all the gods ears.
I’m just glad that adult children of former presidents don’t get it.  Dumb and Dumber don’t deserve it.
"Well, we know you were convicted on NY State charges, but you have to serve time in a Fed pen so your Secret Service agents can be there.."
Think Obama changed it back
I have not heard that at all. Does anyone have a source? I know they can refuse the secret service but I have no heard they do not get lifetime protection.
*Freedom Fries
Jill Too is kind of a weird nickname for the former-VP.
[Correct,](https://www.usatoday.com/amp/1823961) President Obama signed a bill in 2013 reversing a 1994 law that limited protection of former presidents to only 10 years after leaving office.
I was saying that Jill Biden also would have had a secret service nickname.
This was for you Pete. Voted for Joe in AZ today, won't let the virus scare me away from the booth!
To all the Bernie Bros trying to comment and getting removed for being assholes: I'd rather wait 4 more years for federally legal marijuana than vote for Bernie in any way. Not destroying this country is a higher priority than getting high with the White House's permission.
Thank you for doing it for Pete! We are with you. Be safe and well.
Thank you!!
I have that same [sweater](https://imgur.com/MoqeJMJ), fellow DeFranco (and Pete) fan.
Chasten-style glasses would look good on you. :-)
Thank you! Just did the same. Arizona for Joe!
Fellow AZ Peteple!
Thank you for fighting the good fight
Team Pete forever!
Thank you!
Helloooooo ;)
FL-01 in the house (Pensacola, FL, home of the Blue Angels), cast my Pete vote for Biden today. I marked Joe Biden on the ballot, but had Pete in my heart.

Also if there is a dem majority in Congress then it will get legalized. They need to calm down with that haha

> Not destroying this country is a higher priority than getting high with the White House's permission.  Then why are you supporting Joe Biden? The man who wants to bring us back to 2015. Did he already forget what happened right after 2015? Probably.
Ha great to see there's some crossover!
And I used to have those glasses. Hope they make a comeback
I agree! Gotta update my prescription next week and those are the style I wanted to get! Thank you 😋
Hello! 👋 😜
I'd rather not have my country torn apart by a war between two populist demagogue. Getting high with the White House's permission is a lot lower of a priority for me.
Well that's flat out wrong considering Joe wants to decriminilize marijuana.
Also a good point.
That's what I thought when we gained the trifecta in New Jersey.
Oh gosh, I hadn't thought of it like that. Good point, very convincing. You've don't such a good job, in fact, you can retire early from talking politics on the internet. Just stop right now, forever! Congratulations!
And Joe wants them released.
From about halfway down his [Criminal Justice policy:](https://joebiden.com/justice/)  >**Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions**. Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.
You mean the ones Biden wants to release from jail?
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, principled pothead
Serious question, what’s wrong with populism?
Question, what does Joe mean exactly by decriminilization? I've heard he wants to make it entirely up to the states with basically no federal stance on it. Is that true? Because that would be rescheduling. Decriminilization would be making it still illegal under federal law but just smaller penalties.  Thanks! (Legit asking, Bernie supporter trying to learn more about Biden in case it goes that way)
Weed has been used as a weapon against minorities since it was made illegal.    https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-war-on-drugs-is-a-tool-of-state-oppression-8854252.html  The war on drugs^TM is the darling of conservative policy makers. As Democrats, I assumed you would be loath to help the Republicans with their right wing agenda.
Is it at least decriminalized? Edit: I looked and isn’t it on your ballot this year?
Do you want to talk about his voting record? His ever changing positions? How about his proven lies on the debate stage. Remember 2016. He is not Obama. God I hope I’m wrong.
Biden is the one who put them in there in the first place, wtf
So that... More can go in the next day for the same "crime"?
Lol thank you for the best compliment I've ever gotten 😂
The same things that are wrong with cults. It appeals to people's base emotions and removes them from reality. It tells them that only the people in *their* in-group are good, and worthy of respect. It's tells them that anyone not in their group is a hostile, to be attacked and berated.  Populist leaders erode the systems they rise to power in, usurping as much influence as they possibly can. Look at Putin, they're in the process of changing their constitution so he can remain president indefinitely. Trump has talked about the same thing. If Bernie wasn't going to pass in the next decade (not trying to be rude it's just statistically unlikely he makes it much longer than that), I have no difficulty imagining a world where he does the same thing with the full support of his "Bernie or Bust"ers.   Populists have no respect for the rule of law, the world is out to get you and they're the *only* person who can solve the problems facing us. You should give them all the power so they can save you.  Sorry I'm self-isolating now and am high AF, so this response is rambling, but I think I got my point across in there somewhere.
This has already been posted in this thread, but here you go:  >**Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions**. Biden believes no one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, he will decriminalize cannabis use and automatically expunge prior convictions. And, he will support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes, leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.  You can find it about halfway through his [Criminal Justice policy.](https://joebiden.com/justice/)
He wants to decriminilize marijuana, expunge prior records of marijuana convictions, and leave the federal government out of the way for states that want to legalize it further. It's not a major issue for his platform so he's not gone into detail on the specifics, but decriminilization does kind of imply a rescheduling, so I imagine that would have to happen.
Thankfully Joe wants to decriminalize it so people stop getting thrown in jail!
It's on the ballot because the Democratic state legislature couldn't pass a bill.
Yawn.
Please enlighten me on how they would go to jail if he decriminalizes it?
Gotcha, I assume he's just using the term interchangeable since he wants people out of jail. If he gets to office I hope I can at least not be fired for smoking on my free time
**Legalization refers to the repeal or abolishment of laws that prohibit the use, sale and possession of cannabis** and/or the establishment of new legislation that permits use under certain conditions or restrictions. **Decriminalization is the  reduction or repeal of criminal penalties**  imposed for the use, sale, and/or possession of cannabis while cannabis remains illegal or unregulated by the state.  What the above points out is that, under decriminalization,  a cop can still pull you out of the herd for fines and misdemeanors. It's not a solution, but a typical moderate compromise. Biden gave up the game by not going for the gold.
I’m sure it will get passed with it on the ballot!
You summed up Biden campaign in one word. Thanks
Does Joe Biden want to decriminalize?
I agree. Someone else mentioned it, but it's a good point: we have to think about Congress. The presidency isn't a legislative office, if we want legalization we have to have a majority in both houses of Congress. A presidential candidate with coattails is really important, and by all indications Joe is that candidate.
And yet Bernie is losing to a yawn. Hmm
[Yes](https://joebiden.com/justice/)  > Decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions.
I've said before that I'm not a big fan of Joe. I'll vote for him if it comes down to being the candidate though. Ill vote dem all the way down. I'm more so worried that we're gonna now be stuck in this loop forever. Voting "blue no matter who" just because we keep getting piece of shit republicans
How the fuck can you vote for a man who supported the Iraq War?
Nice to see Biden change his tune once again and go more towards the Sanders camp. Previously it seemed he wanted the states to work it out and treat pot as a schedule 2 drug like opium  https://i.imgur.com/e8IWpJK.jpg
I voted for Sanders in the primaries lol
He didn’t move anything. His policy has always been to decriminalize it put it as a schedule 2 drug.
Biden campaign staff to work from home amid coronavirus outbreak
I’m so glad! A leader practicing what he preaches!
I got a call from his campaign that said they were suspending in person volunteer work, but they urged me to sign up online to text/phone bank.  I knocked on doors for Joe last weekend, and it was nice that they reached out to me. They thanked me for my efforts. Super nice people there.
The great thing about technology today is a lot of jobs can be done from home quite easily. Collaboration software really has come a long way and with a good Internet connection their really isn't a reason why a large portion of the work force can't be productive at home. This will be an interesting real time experiment that will hopefully result in a lot of businesses realizing that maybe they don't need to require people to commute into the office every day.
Joe is awesome. I'm please to see a candidate displaying great compassion upon his workers unlike that Sickly Sicko in the WH.
I wonder if the debate would be via webcams
Finally, thank God hopefully this sets a precedent. Opm still hasn't implemented emergency telework so everyone has to go in tomorrow. The DC metro is going to be a shit show
I was like just at a campaign event in my home state and the organizer kept getting calls and stuff and then suddenly she was like oh well I have to leave now what.  It was crazy and crazy scary but crazy awsome and the first time I've ever done any campaign stuff and I loved it. But it was still scary and shocking with what happened and stuff ngl.
Good tbh
I'm really worried he's going to get it and won't come back from it.  Like fate just screwing with us.  I mean, the Comey letter in October 2016 felt like fate screwing with us too.
True, it’s just in terms of how it will affect ground game
[removed]
Public option? Reduced drug costs? Sounds pretty compassionate to me.
This Missouri vote is courtesy of Pete Buttigieg.
As a member of Team Pete, I’m right there with you. MO for JOE.
Thank you!
Trying to think of a show-me joke for showing us your ballot, but I'm not very funny
Your ballots look so much cooler than ours in NC, kinda jealous.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎
the biggest of moods
I did the same switch in California.
Joy: sparked.
Joe will be in Downtown St. Louis tomorrow (Saturday) morning!
I think taking a picture of your ballot is semi-illegal in Missouri? Idk if that applies to a primary/absentee ballots and obviously nothing will happen, but fyi/fun fact.
I didn’t realize you could early vote in MO. I was planning on going in on the 10th.
I’ll be doing the same thing!
I’ll be casting mine in Missouri on Tuesday! From Pete to Joe!
Why joe Biden and not Bernie? (Serious question I want to understand how Biden supporters feel as I think he has the biggest chance of winning)
Show me Joe!
Why not bernie and why do you want joe?(entirely serious question I’m generally curious how Biden supporters feel and I can’t find much about it)
Darn—the reason I early voted is I am heading out of town as we speak 😭
Yeah, from what I understand it's legally a grey area, but you're right about it not really being enforced. Either way--I was sneaky :)
Technically absentee. I’ll be out of town. But it’s not like they double check you’ll actually be gone 🤷‍♀️
I think OP already stated "courtesy of Pete Buttigieg" so this vote is cos Pete endorsed Biden?   Think abt it, a 37yr no name recognition mayor of Indiana's fourth largest city managed to win Iowa, 1.4% from Bernie in NH. It takes a lot of trust to support such an underdog so folks in his movement will be more inclined to consider the candidate he endorsed.
1) my candidate endorsed Biden  2) mathematically I don’t think Bernie stands much of a chance of getting the nomination.   3) as trump and many other republicans have gleefully pointed out, Bernie would destroy the down ballot possibly even allowing the gop to take back the house.   4) I am much more moderate than Bernie. I 100% believe that government should provide heath care to those in need, but I don’t think that’s best suited by abolishing all private insurance and forcing everyone into a government plan is the way to go. I think Biden is right when he talks about wanting to expand the ACA and the individual state marketplaces. Ambetter was a life saver for me when I worked retail.   5) I don’t think Bernie has any idea what he’s doing and he has a rather poor senate record, including being to the right of trump on gun control. I complain about my job all the time and how the c-suite seem to get all the perks but if you made me CEO tomorrow, I wouldn’t have any idea how to put any of my water cooler plans in action.   6) I don’t like his record of defending Soviet Russia, Cuba and Venezuela. I won’t say he’s a communist because he’s not, but he sure has rose colored glasses on the subject.   7) Does he come with any other phrases other than “the 1%”? It’s like his omelette du fromage.   8) there is absolutely a problem with income inequality in this country, but I don’t appreciate being lectured about it by a multimillionaire that owns three palatial homes, the cost of each one being well out of reach for the average American worker (and you can bet there’s a damn fine wine cave in at least one of them).  and the most important reason, more influential than his policies or age: his supporters. Back in 2016, I was curious about him and his ideas, but Bernie bros have completely soured me on him. I’d rather deal with an alt-right MAGA hat wearing redneck spouting off Sean hannity’s latest conspiracy on pizzagate in Iran or whatever than deal with another smarmy, condescending Bernie bro that tells me I know nothing and I’m just a corporate shill and a little bitch for billionaires. Go mention anything even remotely negative on r/politics to see this first hand.   It all comes down to marketing a brand, and in that area Bernie’s supporters have failed spectacularly.   Biden wasn’t my first or second choice, but at the end of the day he’s the *only* choice.
To sum up a lot of details in a quick reddit comment: Joe will actually get realistic things done, as he's been doing for decades. He has a realistic plan on universal healthcare (as opposed to Bernie's, which is far to the left of every country in the world), a realistic plan on climate change, etc.   Bernie also supports policies that are patently insane to me - he's just as much of a protectionist as Donald Trump is, for example.   I really wish we had an option that wasn't nearly 80 years old but of the two I'll take the one who got VAWA passed and personally accelerated the legalization of gay marriage over the one who has passed 3 bills ever and whose supporters spent months calling Pete Buttigieg 'not gay enough'.

Warren voter coming aboard! Wanted to explain why I chose Biden over Bernie.
Thank you and welcome! Recent Pete refugee here. I like your thought process.  Joe's team is real coalition politics, with room for all the voices to take part; this will be a great environment for all stripes of Democrats to contribute and make their case for their ideas. And, when we win, a great environment to put forward all sorts of ideas to help heal this country and make desperately-needed change. Especially when some new Democratic Senators ride in on Joe's coattails; they'll make Mitch McConnell go sit in a corner and think about what he's done!
Welcome!  Appreciate you sharing your thinking. A lot that resonates with me as someone also that's "more progressive" in my policy views but ultimately I want real engagement with the complicated reality of actually getting things done and understanding you need to build coalitions to do it.
Welcome aboard.    Bernie is a populist, and I think we've all had enough of populism in the White House.
I'm right there with you, just a few minutes behind.
Very good analysis.
Welcome!
I agree with you. When it comes to passing progressive policy, I feel like Bernie asks for too much, and his inability to work with other democrats in the senate means that his big bold revolutionary demands might not even get past democrats, much less republicans. Biden might not be as progressive, but I trust his ability to make some incremental progress, to solidify Obama's legacy and make it something we can build off of. It's much easier to get single payer if we have a popular public option already rather than starting from zero.
This is an Intellectual Warren voter right here. Good analysis.   I really do not like Bernie’s handling of critical media. I really care about the 1st amendment and despise politicians who threaten it
Pete to Biden supporter here. Thanks so much for this, it’s helping me put words and logic around how I’ve been feeling about the campaigns.
I see the boo birds are here downvoting comments.  We are stronger than you and your arbitrary taking our fake internet points.
The best part about team Joe is that nobody is asking you to hate anyone, nobody is asking you to change your beliefs to fit the mold, and nobody is trying to "one-up" each other by showing how radical theh are.     Everyone is valued and accepted for who they are and what they bring to the table.     I'm not all that excited about Joe, if I'm being honest, but I'm very excited about the coalition he's building and what it represents.
Welcome and thank you for your support! We are glad to have you.
Warren shot up in my rankings when she detailed her transition plan towards Medicare for All, to include a public option bill.  The reaction of many Bernie supporters, to call her a traitor for acknowledging that immediately passing m4a was impossible, is.... telling  That’s where I want to end up, too.  But I don’t see how it’s possible without an intermediate step.  And they don’t seem to... care?  Warren is amazing and I hope we see more of her.  Welcome!
Greetings and Welcome.
Thanks for that insight! That's how I viewed Warren, she was basically as progressive as Bernie, but without the uncompromising populist approach. As a Pete supporter, her agenda still seemed a little bit too unwieldy to me, but I do appreciate that she tried make her policy proposals reflect the complexities of the world.   I actually loved her anti-corruption plan more than anything any candidate proposed, but ultimately it was her Medicare-for-all that made me choose Pete over Warren. I do know that she dialed it back a bit over time, but by that point I had already found too much that I liked with Pete to switch back.   I do hope she has a role in the next administration though, she is wicked smart, experienced, and brings much needed empathy. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Welcome to Team Biden/Pete/Amy/Beto/Warren! (Anybody got a better name?).
Glad to have you! Those are exactly the reasons I stopped supporting Sanders even though I voted for him in 2016.  Biden may not align with Warren 100%, but he'll definitely meet you half way on a lot of issues and offer more nuanced leadership than Sanders.
Welcome to the big tent!
Completely agree! I'm a Pete supporter here but Warren was my number two. Hell more like 1.5! My fear of Bernie drove me this way more than anything else tbh.   Cheers to you and sorry for your loss. I know how bad it feels to have so much hope and fire behind someone to suddenly see it die out. Warren was a fantastic candidate and honestly i still struggle with who would be a better POTUS between her and Pete on occasion.
Very solid analysis of the issues. I hope you will find a good group of folks here. Let's win this thing.
All excellent reasons,and why I wouldheave voted for Warren in the generalwithout a second hesitation whereas voodoo votingfor Sanders would have been difficult. Their policies might be similar,by buti trust Warren's judgement,I don't trust Sanders judgement.  When I heard Warren being criticized for "being an ivy league professor"n it sent good down my some. That's not something you criticize someone for.  And while I line up with Biden's policies more than Warren's,I am saddened that her campaign was sunk for being honest about M4A,especially while Sanders skates by on being dishonest. I a better world Biden and Warren would be the last two standing and we would see a vigorous debate on policy substance. We as a party and a country need to have these debates and now,sadly , we aren't going to this election.  Ashtray,welcome aboard! Happy you're with us!
Welcome!  I went back and forth on Liz, Joe, and Pete, voted for Warren, but am now totally ridin' with Biden.  I voted for Bernie 4 years ago but later became turned off by him for the reasons you've listed.
Nice! When did you move to Warren's camp?
Welcome😍
I was a Warren Supporter and without second thought i am on the Biden Train. Same here with some of Bernie policy wise. But BIDEN is someone we need NOW.
Im on the same boat! Agree with pretty much everything you said.
Welcome aboard. As a Beto guy I'm probably more progressive than the majority of people in the Joe camp and I think your spot on. The thing that sold me was Bernie doesn't really have a good theory of the case on how he gets his policies passed in the Senate. The map isn't favorable to the supermajorities that Bernie needs to win but what it is favorable too is coming together and taking the next few steps together.    Your in the right place.
I’m fairly certain if I articulated exactly why I came to Biden from Warrens camp, in relation to Bernie, it would be exactly these points. Also I think Joe has a lot of really important international relationships and would be the best plug and play foreign policy President we could have, I get the distinct impression that aside from climate, Bernie is rather isolationist which is not what we need.
As a Pete supporter who proudly voted for Warren last week, I totally agree with everything you said. Biden was an amazing VP and will be an amazing President.   Bernie will keep on doing his "fight the establishment/Democrats" thing, but the Presidency isn't the right place for that. I'm sure he'll go back to being an Independent again once this election is done.
Thank you!  I'm also a Warren refugee who has been lurking in here today trying to mull my options.  I am also to the left of Biden on policy, but I have hesitated to support Bernie because a lot of things just don't sit right with me - many of which you mentioned.  Bernie seems to want to blow up the system, while people like Warren wanted to reform it from within.  And I feel this black and white attitude (and a few other things) will sink him against Trump in November.  I still have concerns about Biden too (can he excite the base enough to beat Trump?), but right now my concerns with Bernie are bigger.
Welcome!  Most of your analysis meshes with my own. The one thing I saw different personally is Warren on medicare for all. To me it appeared that she refused to explain anything in the debates, and that, combined with her lack of detailed foreign policy proposals as contrasted with Biden’s strength in that area, straightfoward manner, and inspirational rhetoric about what America is and should be, which I didn’t see from Warren or any other candidate, lead me to switch my support from Warren to Biden in November. I had switched from Castro to Warren in September, and from Warren to Castro in February.
I agree with this, and would emphasize that to me, good *process* is actually more important than good *policy.*   What I mean by that is: I would rather back someone who seems to have comparatively modest goals but who has some clear process by how to achieve those goals than someone who has amazing, far reaching goals but seems to provide no real way to get to them. I think that's something a (former) Pete supporter and I would share in common, and it's something I appreciate about Joe and his clear understanding of coalition building, as you said.
Yes!  Absolutely.  I've been seeing a whole lot from Bernie supporters lately about how Warren and her supporters have "taken healthcare away from children" and it just makes me angry.  Healthcare is a very big deal for me and, in my opinion, anyone supporting a Democrat doesn't want to take healthcare away from anyone.  But to move the needle on healthcare, we need to win back the Senate and work with other Democrats (most of whom are to the right of Bernie).
This 1000 times. Populism: never again. I think that should be the takeaway from 2016
Preach it.  I never voted for a populist but I did wonder in 2016 how a bull in the China shop would have worked. 2020, nope I’m good.
Yep. I'm just hoping the current populist peacefully leaves office after he loses his election. Other countries haven't had the best of luck with that (article from 2018): https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/hard-data-populism-bolsonaro-trump/578878/  > According to our research, populist governments have deepened corruption, eroded individual rights, and inflicted serious damage on democratic institutions. ...  > Here’s how we formed our list: We selected 66 leading peer-reviewed journals in political science, sociology, and regional studies; identified all articles published in these journals on the subject of populism, as well as political leaders linked with populism; then vetted each potential case study, consulting with country and regional experts. Populist governments, in our working definition, are united by two fundamental claims: (1) Elites and “outsiders” work against the interests of the “true people,” and (2) since populists are the voice of the “true people,” nothing should stand in their way.  > Ultimately, we identified 46 populist leaders or political parties that have been in power across 33 democratic countries between 1990 and today, giving us the ability to settle the theoretical debate about the tension between populism and democracy in a rigorous, empirical way, on a global scale, for the first time. The results were alarming: Populists are highly skilled at staying in power and pose an acute danger to democratic institutions. ... In fact, only 17 percent of populists stepped down after they lost free and fair elections. Another 17 percent vacated high office after they reached their term limits. But 23 percent left office under more dramatic circumstances—they were impeached or forced to resign. Another 30 percent of all populist leaders in our database remain in power to this day. 
I doubt there is a unIntellectual Warren voter. They are all wicked smart and caring.
I got banned from the Bernie sub just for saying he wouldn't be able to get M4A passed. Not that it was a bad plan, but that it wouldn't pass.  Didn't even realize I was on their sub, just scrolling through /all.
> (Anybody got a better name?).   The Union. I've been listening to Battle Cry of Freedom on a loop since last night.
I feel like most of us Pete and Warren supporters feel very similar.
This is a really good way to express an idea I'd been struggling to articulate. Thank you.
Oooh.  Yes.  Wow.  You put your finger on it exactly.  Wow.  Have you been spending the last several months imprinting on some highly incisive politician or something?  :)
I think it's both. Both definitely matter. I'm also a Warren supporter, and I would never say that I dont care for warren's progressive vision. I'll just say that I think Bernie lacks the ability to wield the process effectively more than Biden lacks progressive values. On top of that, it's a lot easier to sway Biden over to more progressive stances on certain issues than it will be for Bernie to make peace and friendship with the democratic party and its members in congress.
End of the day, Pete and Warren were *very* close together on 4-year policy.   Warren frequently focused on the second iteration of some of her plans while Pete only acknowledged that there'd be more to do after phase 1.  Somehow that made Warren progressive and Pete moderate according to the media. Tone was the primary difference between them, both of them were pragmatic first and progressive second.
Now all I can hear is John Mullany (never a bad thing) :  "There is a HORSE...in the HOSPITAL."
votes speak louder than coin
Bernie fans said they wanted to get money out of politics. They got their wish last night!
Aaaaaand that makes Bros invent conspiracies rather than seeing charm, aptitude and an established reputation by Joe
It worked for him in some states last night but that's a terrible plan moving forward.
I forgot what state was this agian?
What's wrong with a grassroots campaign funded by supporters?

or just the fact that he's so unpopular that just about everyone has jumped ship to anyone other than him (not trying to diss Biden, I love him, but I think Bernie's lack of appeal has more to do with it).
I’m fully aware of that. At the end of the day it’s a meme. Just trying to laugh a little while showing the strength and dependency of the moderate base. Once the field thinned out, Biden’s job got much easier.
Minnesota!
Nothing, but just saying that Biden didn’t need coin to take states like MN, where he spent $0 and had no field offices.
He won in multiple super tuesday states despite never going to those respective states, having no field offices in those respective states and spending $0 in those respective states.
Take Minnesota for example
Not the case! Biden’s campaign was on its last leg. Not a single ground office in multiple super Tuesday states. It was the Joementum! Bernie outspent him by a huge margin, but it wasn’t enough.
It kind of makes me sad for democracy
[removed]
You are honestly that uninformed? You don’t know that Biden had SuperPac support? It was a great night for Joe, but let’s be honest, ok?
??? All this says is that A) money can’t but votes and B) a history of legislative success is important to voters. THIS IS GREAT FOR DEMOCRACY!
I love Democracy!
Ok Zoomer. Last time I checked, voter turnout was higher than ever, and it wasn’t the young people Bernie promised to bring out, but the communities Joe Biden has fought, and SUCCESSFULLY protect throughout his career. There’s nothing like receipts. Angry rhetoric can only do so much.
My point is, that’s not responsible for his success. He was polling incredibly low until his comeback in South Carolina. That has nothing to do with PAC money. It was just the moderate field getting smaller. Bernie heavily campaigned and visited his super Tuesday wins while there were no Biden offices, or visits to multiple of his winning states!

First of all, I’m almost fucking 30, second of all, don’t get me wrong, I’m voting for Joe if he gets the nom. But Hillary had 19% less voter turnout than Obama in 2012. Obama was a fucking rockstar with the youth and cool with older, moderate voters. Bernie is right about one thing for sure, we need historic voter turnout to beat trump. Can joe make up that 19%? You have enough to get the nom, ok. But YOU NEED some kind of youth enthusiasm to put a Dem over the top. This meme doesn’t help. That’s all I’m saying. Punching downwards at a bunch of starry eyed kids who want a future isn’t how the ‘adults’ should be leading. Lead by example. The way my fellow progressives act is sometimes appalling to me, but most of them are you and passionate. SHOW US HOW ITS DONE, BOOMER.
This is a two edged sword tho, it’s a good thing to not have a national infrastructure?  It’s only because people are ready to get rid of trump that he was able to win. In a normal year with just a normal evil Repub Biden would have been in trouble
lmfao im 18
It's a meme dude, chill out. Were 100% welcoming of former supporters. That's the cool thing about being in a big tent....Biden doesn't ask you to stop loving Bernie to vote for him.
Starry eyed folks would actually vote. This is pretense that the loudest are truly the ones who care or are engaged.. not so.
Haha don't feed this troll
Soooooo you’re the zoomer
And we don't expect any real change under Biden.  I'll vote for him if he is the nominee, because the alternative Party is an outright criminal organization, embodied by their flag bearer.    Biden talks about a big tent when he needs votes.  We will see how big that tent really is when progressives ask him to go beyond just cleaning up Trump's mess.
Bernie is only 65 delegates behind. Biden took the night, but not by as much as everyone is making it out to be. You still need those of us that voted in the general to beat trump. Also, far more people show up in general for a general election over a primary.
How am I a troll? Because I don’t 100% agree with you? Literally trying to find common ground with you people, but you don’t want to? This is why Trump will win a second term.
Step 1. Take the Senate.
In 2020, Joe Biden and the “moderates” are well to Obama’s left
Looking back, other than trying to get healthcare passed, Obama was extreme centrist. He didn't even wanna jump on pushing for LGBTQ+ rights until Biden supported it
Preach! And he's gotten even more progress since the publication of this ad; namely his housing plan, warren bankruptcy plan, and bernie-inspire free college for families earning less than $125,000.
Feel free to check my post history, I haven't been a Bernie Bro since back in 2016, and this cycle I was a huge Buttigieg supporter now fully behind Biden.    Bernie deserves a lot of the credit for Biden being considered a "Moderate" and especially for people like Pete and Warren occasionally being tagged with the moniker themselves. In 2016, Bernie gave the Overton Window in the US a swift and long overdue kick to the left, and brought many ideas that were previously considered radical to the mainstream of political conversation.    A public option healthcare plan that provides universal coverage is now considered a compromise by many in America, and that's positive progress!   The "moderate" candidate supports $15 minimum wage, free college for over 80% of Americans, an aggressive climate policy that includes a carbon tax/dividend. Fuck yeah!    Seeing actual progressive policies marketed in a way that is palatable and even appealing to the older generations and those who sit near the middle of the political spectrum is awesome, and a if this type of platform can defeat Trump and Trumpism, then Biden deserves so much credit for sliding to the left and Bernie deserves credit for giving him the political cover to do so.   The turnout numbers give me hope that we might actually be able to do this in November.
Thank you, I wish the msm was on this point from the beginning
YES. And that is OK. Just Sayin...
Hopefully Biden doesn't get caught up in the social media attention that used to be focused on Bernie/Warren.  The country as a whole isn't as far left as Twitter a s Reddit makes it look like.
Bidens Campaign and Obamas campaign are virtually identical, but with updated ideals based on current events
Thats easy to do when Obama was barely even left.
> Looking back, other than trying to get healthcare passed, Obama was extreme centrist  woah, woah, woah wait a second, there... I'm glad Joe is running where he's at, but Obama was not an "extreme centrist" in any way, shape or form.   The BernieBros may have normalized this interpretation but it's as untrue now as it was before they invented the characterization from whole cloth in 2016 because they needed some way to label Hillary Clinton as a centrist, but people kept accurately pointing out that she worked for Obama.  Obama was progressive when he ran and progressive as president. The nation's politics have moved to the left since then but that doesn't mean the context of when he was in office doesn't matter to how we characterize his politics.   And the gay marriage thing? That's another common BernieBro narrative that strips away all nuance or context to the events as they transpired. If Obama had come out fully in favor of gay marriage in 2008, it was likely to both hurt his chances to win (in which case we'd have gotten mccain who is clearly worse on LGBTQ issues) and set back the issue publicly as it'd have just caused controversy, not actually more acceptance.
I mean it’s a bit of a tail wagging the dog situation. Obama had to run far more centrist campaign so that he could win the far more centrist party’s nomination, and then help move everything to a much more progressive place by the time he left
Agreed, Democrats moving left of Obama is a good thing.
I think there were more liberal legislation he wanted to do, but the Republicans got the House in 2010, so there wasn't anything he could do after the ACA.
It's tough to say. He had to deal with unprecedented levels of obstruction while carrying the weight of being the first black president in history. He likely felt undue pressure to compromise so he wasn't seen as ineffective. That all said, it's clear he was very competent, took the job very seriously, and applied his morality to it as best as he was allowed.
From what I've seen, Obama and Biden agreed in 2012 to support gay rights later, Biden just let it slip early and Obama came to back him.
> Obama was extreme centrist. He didn't even wanna jump on pushing for LGBTQ+ rights until Biden supported it  There's more to LGBTQ rights than the marriage issue.   Obama signed the Matthew Shepard Act in 2009 to update the federal hate crime law to include protections for  gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. He signed the law to Repeal Don't Ask Don't Tell in 2010. [Obama has left a fantastic record when it comes to LGBTQ rights](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/01/20/19-ways-barack-obama-changed-the-world-on-lgbt-rights-2/).
I agree with this somewhat, but I read a really interesting article (I’ll try and find it) that was written by an older black activist who really hated this idea that Bernie should get credit for pushing these “new” ideas when others had been for years before him. She cited various high level people who caught traction and made the  country ready to accept Bernie. I also saw Whoopie Goldberg articulate this same idea well.
Derogatory names for Bernie supporters will not earn their support for Biden and Trump will win in 2020.  Maybe consider spreading the word to stop slandering Bernie voters.
Obama's sidekick wants us to trust him again
Accept your losses and move on. You should be happy, not salty that the party is moving left.
🙄
Indeed. While Bernie may take credit for several progressive policies and while his supporters may gatekeep the term, Hillary Clinton championed universal healthcare back in the 90s and Newt Gingrich made it his life’s goal to run propaganda against her.  While Bernie adopted the Green Deal, let’s not forget that it was Ed Markey who put it forward. And Bernie adopted parts from Tom Steyer’s plan.  Gun control? He was in the NRA’s pockets until it became politically inconvenient.  UBI? Andrew Yang deserves all the credit.   Hell, Elizabeth Warren has much better and much more pragmatic and practical versions of every progressive idea.
If you want me to stop calling you a 'bro', maybe you should stop calling me a fascist.
I didn’t call you a fascist.
C'mon. Get over yourself. Not everything a more extreme Bernie supporter said has to be taken back for Biden supporters to realize we need Bernie supporters on our side. There's no name calling that's more important than that.

Unironically I really hope Chris Evans runs for office some day.  I have a theory he really has a ridiculous Boston accent that he hides, his mother does and so does that entire side of his family. There were *touches* of it coming out when he was a surrogate for his uncle
Please don't insult Boomers here.  Support for Joe comes from us as well.
There are baby boomers who are great.There is as subset who are still some of the strongest voices against war because of the Vietnam experience whereas it is seemingly getting harder to find later generations speaking up about it as much

Republican mayor drops Donald Trump for Joe Biden in key swing state of Michigan
>"Since announcing my endorsement of Joe Biden I have received an outpouring of encouraging messages and believe even more strongly that Joe Biden is the candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in Macomb County and the State of Michigan," Taylor said in a statement to Newsweek on Monday.  >While Taylor, a life-long Republican, voted for President Donald Trump in 2016, he said he would cast his ballot for Biden this year because Trump is "deranged."  >"I think Joe Biden is the candidate who can unify all of the Democrats and he's the candidate who can appeal to moderates and Republicans like me who don't want to see four more years of President Trump," Taylor said, according to the Chicago Tribune on Monday.
A lot of independents and moderate Republicans have endorsed Joe Biden.  Even scaramucci, former Trump loyalist has got his Joementum.   Joe biden is the only candidate who can unite America.
The suburbs could really be a strong show of force with the voters most likely to swing and this seems like a really positive development for us in helping to achieve it!
And this is exactly why Joe will win.  Giving the Never Trump crowd someone they can actually feel good about voting for.  Most longtime Republican voters have been quietly repulsed by this White House, but haven’t had the courage to overtly speak out against it. Hillary only lost in 2016 because of decades of relentless hate from every single right wing outlet.  Given the choice between Trump and a sane, stable man with character, Republicans will quietly vote to get rid of the embarrassment to their party.
 Now that’s news!!
Wow is this republican mayor apart of the cOrRupT DNC???
A smart decision, from a Republican ? What gives ?!
The 🎪 just got 10 feet bigger!
Republicans endorsing us at this point isn’t good.  Unless you actually agree with republicans on some things of course.
This is why I'm with Joe even if my background is more progressive: I want America to belong to all of us and be led by a decent human being.
in coming mean tweet.   virus and market be damned.
Joe's becoming a surgeon. Reinstalling GOP's moral backbone.
Joe Walsh in on record saying vote for Democrats, at least in 2020. Not just the nominee, but Democrats in general. That's the level of batshit crazy we've reached.  I need Uncle Joe to restore sanity and put Joe Walsh back on his side of politics, because I don't like this timeline at all.
What other Republicans have endorsed him?  We need to get the narrative rolling that Biden's not just the unity candidate for the primary; he's the unity candidate in the general.
One of my buddies has slowly gone from "I love Trump" to "I like the policies, but he needs to shut up," to "I never liked Trump."  A lot of people are embarrassed by Trump and we can either get their votes or demand their penance, and we can't do both. Biden supporters will mostly welcome them back, Bernie supporters will welcome them to the whipping post.
He's endorsing Biden because only Bernie can defeat Trump!  (In a yelling competition.)
Anyone know some Amish we can ~~call~~ send word to?
We do agree with Republicans on some things. For instance, we agree with this Republican that Joe Biden is better than Trump.
Tribalism at its best. If you read the quote in the article from the **Republican!!** then I’m sure we all agree with him in the need to defeat Trump. He’s an ally for Joe this election
Literal lives are on the line.
And an honest DOJ ! And let’s get a not so treasonous Senate !
George Conway literally donated the max to joe
That is the most screwed up timeline.
We're about the get the Bush effect but times 5.
Someone tweeted George back asking if the contribution came from their joint account?  lol
Even if you don't support Joe always remember this. We have to vote!
I can’t wait for him to campaign in full force this year, I think he restrained himself in 2016 to avoid looking like he was interfering and no one took Trump seriously. I expect to see a lot of Obama later this year!
My parents taught me a simple rule, if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about politics. It was really hard not not complaining during the red wave of 2014, so I'm never making that mistake again.
Obama, the classiest of acts.
Forgot that this statement came up more than once    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeuZvGhwLiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeuZvGhwLiM) \- 2016   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baTwj-67hUg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baTwj-67hUg) \- 2012
Vote blue no matter who!
I honestly feel that if you don't support Joe, you should sit this one out.  But that is just one man's opinion.
[removed]
Yup! I personally don't want Obama to come out for Joe before the general. I think it blunts the impact of his campaigning in the general. He's always been such a unifying speaker that I think he can do a lot to heal the wounds at the DNC and beyond. He's just a generational orator. I still watch his 2008 DNC speech and acceptance speech when I feel sad
I say that to anyone who tells me they don't vote. If you don't vote, you can't bitch. And I LOVE to bitch!
I think its tempting to agree with you but voting is a duty of all Americans. A healthy civic society relies on it. I want everyone to vote, even if they disagree with me. I think a lot of the issues in this country could be addressed if we got general election voter turnout to 60%-65%.
trump winning in real time right there.
I disagree but that’s your right. Dont forget to vote for whoever you support!
Totally agree. You know the "he didn't earn it" narrative would immediately take hold if Obama did that. No thanks.
I recall watching his convention keynote in 2004 and thinking "this guy will be president eight or twelve years from now". I was wrong about the timing, of course.
I was kind of kidding, but I do get frightened at how many people lack knowledge of even the most basic civics and politics.  And they get the same one vote you and I do.
Why, because people can’t take a joke?
I mean he was president during that time.
[removed]
I think wlievens is talking about Obama's 04 DNC speech, he was a senator then.

Yes but he said he would be president eight (2012)-twelve (summer 2016) years from then.

Biden, not Sanders, gains in popularity after Warren drops out: Reuters/Ipsos poll; Biden 47%, Sanders 30%
Who woulda thunk that demonizing a candidate with similar views to yours along with their considerable number of passionate supporters could backfire on you  🤔. Also weaponizing sexism, homophobia, racism, and other forms of bigotry to attack the other candidates, their supporters, and demographics who give them support. Sanders is so full of shit talking about how it’s only like 0.1% of his supporters are toxic. Every single person expressing their political opinions online not aligned with Bernie has almost certainly been harassed by his supporters, including death threats with lots of Soviet/ communist references.
The thing is Sanders people don't understand this at all. They thought the opposition to their cult leader was just due to policies. They didn't understand the toxicity that both them and their candidate were giving off to other progressives who have the same end-goals.
Dates: Mar. 6-9, 2020  Spread: **Biden +17**  The pollster has a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight.
Bernie is done
I hate Sam Seder. Tonight on Chris Hayes. Talked about "lesser of two Evils" Biden vs Sanders. REALLY. Enough of this Crap.
Oh and *throws confetti *
What’s that 30% meme from minions.....
The Joementum is incredible!\~
I just checked 538 again and not only is it still 99% vs 0.1% for majority, they list the chances of Biden getting plurality at ">99% of 100".   …….you mean 100?
I’ve been called stupid multiple times because the Brothers have turned me off from the candidate.   These people don’t comprehend that being hostile is hurting their candidate more than helping.   I never had vitriol from the Yang sub (until Brothers started infiltrating), Amy subs or here. Just when I venture into the cesspool of R Politics or the like.
Agreed. Decorum and respectability must come first and even before policy. We must have compassion for everyone.   Medicare for all? How about kindness for all. I'm a former Warren supporter and I'm happy to vote for Biden.
[removed]
or they just really loved her.  Her policies hurt her more then they helped her. IMO
Former Warren voter here; I like Joe, but I’m supporting Bernie.  It is very likely that Joe will get the nomination, but I promise you that comments like this make it a fuck ton harder for me to volunteer and donate.  There’s just not a place in this campaign’s vision for, say, an activist like myself.  Not if I’m just a member of a cult.  This place is becoming as bad as the Sanders subs when it comes to insulting my intelligence and motivations.
Well she never actually endorsed the only other progressive.  That may play a factor.
that's cute
I used to really like Sam. but at a certain point it seemed like him in the people on his show wanted to be mad more than they wanted to actually accomplish anything.

I agree with Carville's take. She was a pretty perfect unity  candidate until the M4A debacle.
At the end of the day it is your decision but fact of the matter is a lot of Bernie's supporters have been incredibly  viritolic to his opponents.No we don't think every one of Bernie's supporters are this way but it is large enough for it be frustrating and needing to vent.If you are browsing r/joebiden you are likely to meet such people because they don't have many other places to go.Hopefully you can understand this rather than thinking it as a blanket insult to all bernie supporters
He really is though.
[deleted]
Idk. She was “fight the fight worth fighting for” candidates prior to her revision of m4a plan.  And, she was pretty defensive about M4A and deflected the incoming attacks on m4a by making it as something that is tough but worth fighting for. (And added some unnecessary comments involving ‘Republican Talking Points’.)
I think she has poor political instincts. She could have won this, but made a critical error at a critical juncture.
Refresh my memory: M4A?
There aren’t enough other places for people to bash the left wing of the party?   I’ve happily posted here since Joe announced his candidacy, and shared the things I like about him.  It’s quickly become a place for people to talk about how the left wing of the party are all blindly following some evil demagogue who promises fantasy giveaways.  I’ve got a masters in legislative affairs and have worked in the healthcare policy space, and I have to vote for someone who believes in single-payer healthcare.  I get the people who disagree, but I don’t call Biden supporters brainwashed neoliberal foot soldiers for Milton Friedman.  I cannot underestimate the importance of defeating the conservatives in Congress and the White House, so I’ll work hard for whoever our nominee is, but the constant insulting of people who support Sanders like they’re idiots won’t bring the party together.  I don’t frequent the Sanders subs, but maybe  this place is becoming too toxic too.

Medicare for All
> who promises fantasy giveaways  In case of Sanders this is arguably true.Best case scenario 4 senate seats are flipped and barely get a senate majority.Sanders has already committed to not ending the fillibuster and in no scenario is Joe Manchin voting for M4A.So he really is promising something that he can't deliver.  I bash the left wing of the party because  they act like  multipayer universal healthcare (which works very well in germany and easy to build on rather than scrap everything and start from the scratch) is not a thing at all and act as if anyone who doesn't want the exact version of M4A wants people to die without healthcare.In all other policies as well moderates want incremental change not no change at all.That is the fundamental disagreement.  and don't pretend like you don't do your own share of bad faith bashing  >“nothing will fundamentally change.”  you use this out of context quote in a rant at r/warren which was actually Biden talking about increased taxes on the wealthy won't effect their lifestyle.  I don't mean you any ill will but we have disagreements and people obviously want to talk about them given how r/politics and other political spaces are all left wing spaces  So all in all if you find it unbearable come back after the primaries (if he wins if not  doesn't matter anyway) when the intraparty fights are over
No, you're thinking of Bernie
Lets give it up for the man that made tonight possible: Rep. Jim Clyburn, everyone.

Congressman Jim Clyburn’s endorsement before the South Carolina primary will have effects all throughout southern states yet to come.
Did you see their attempt to primary Pelosi, he won 12ish percent of the vote, so he'll go to the general. But she got over 70% lmao
Hey this is Pete erasure!
Pete only dropped out after he got mollywhopped in South Carolina. Up until that point he was only hurting the party by crowing out resources, media attention, and delegates.
Bernie would have swept ST up if it weren’t for folks dropping out and that’s a  fact.
Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, a 37 year old mayor doesn't belong in the race in the first place, this thing may have been over earlier if he never got in.
Idk man. He’s going to end this primary as one of the only three people to win a state, and did it up against literally all odds. I don’t think Joe would have won faster if he dropped out a while ago— look at Beto/Kamala/Booker dropping out, that didn’t settle it for Biden then. Joes big win last night came from the moderates consolidating— 100%.
Van Jones: I Don't Know How "Joe Biden Sucks" Grows Your Movement
What we learned is that unity is the antidote to complaint politics
When Van Jones is astute enough to point out how trash your political strategy is then you know it must be really bad.  Seriously though, it was always going to come to this. Bernie and his campaign are irresponsibly fanning the flames of division and are going to turn this campaign really ugly.  They have no problem with damaging the likely nominee and now they're pushing the narrative that Joe has dementia.  Just real gross stuff.
Can't wait for the racial attacks against Van from a certain campaign.
It's like Bernie read "Lord of the Flies" and said, YES.    He really needs to hire Pete to give him a plan for his revolution.
Maybe they can find some more cspan material from the 80s, thatll change things.   Why no ofcourse the 1984 election isnt relevant. A leftist losing to a conservative incumbent in 49 states would never happen. It was almost 40 years ago!
It's a shame that Bernie's last run will be remembered for petty attacks that only feed Trump's populist carnival bullshit.
The most it can do is depress turnout of people who might vote for Joe.  No one should want to win that way.
Van “This is the Moment Trump Became President” Jones said this shit.
Toxic sanders supporters preparing themselves a big ol "nothing burger."
Genuine question, but what exactly is Joe's record on segregation and his comments on Strom  Thurmond?  I'm split between Biden and Sanders and I've obviously seen the Sander's side of the argument.
And yet Biden supporters arent exactly trying to win November. Every time I check threads to see if Biden voters are ready for unity all I see is name calling.   Were going to get crushed in November. Whether I vote or not.
>When Van Jones is astute enough to point out how trash your political strategy is then you know it must be really bad.  I don't know why this isn't more obvious. I've never managed to have a Bernie supporter tell my why their candidate is better. Whether it was Hillary or Warren or now Joe, their fallback is to trash my chosen candidate. They have no arguments in favor of their own. I don't even know what Bernie's arguments are for why I should vote for him. Pay for student debt with a sketchy speculation tax? Pass M4A?   His only answer is that he'll have a revolution. His revolution can't even show up to vote in a primary. There is no revolution. Just a bunch of people who are angry on the internet.
>going to turn this campaign really ugly.  Maybe not. They're campaign will likely be over next week lol
>They have no problem with damaging the likely nominee  Now why does this sound so familiar...
You know there are doctors who are legitimately worried about Biden right? You think trump wont him with that? Maybe Biden should stiffen his spine a bit.
I'd also point out moderate dems have been saying Bernie wants a venezuela type state. Dont you see you calling out that bullshit.   Exactly. Shut up.
That's the whole point of the primary to air things out before the general. You think Trump is going to play with kid gloves? And of course Bernie is running against Biden and not Trump because that is what you do in a primary. I'm sorry your candidates whole campaign message is I'm better than trump, congratulations you joined the ranks of any sane politician.
He’s *totes* establishment....
Oh, you must have missed the new talking point. It seems that Walter Mondale was actually a moderate all this time.
I think the better historical example is 1972, when McGovern's "grassroots" progressive campaign against a Republican incumbent crashed and burned in one of the biggest landslides in history.
I mean it is a campaign they have to campaign against another democrat first it sucks that it hurts politicians feelings but wait until joe gets to trump it will be nothing but insults at Biden.
[removed]
Stay with Sanders if ancient history like segregation bothers you. My pragmatic politicians do whats necessary to get in and do what good is possible. Joe's made mistakes, but he has *done* things.  Sanders is pure and has never accomplished anything. Even Mitch McConnell brought more people to the MLK protest than Sanders did.
It isn’t “we” getting crushed if “you” don’t vote
Says the dude going on the other campaign's sub and telling them they're losers.
I asked a Bernie supporter I know personally to tell me why I should feel confident he can beat Trump in a general election. Her answer essentially boiled down to "because it's a movement."
the 'revolution' stayed home and it was embarrassing. Why Do I think Bernie is the best candidate? its a good question, one I haven't really thought about. I hear what he is for and I like it a lot. I preferred him in 16 and I prefer him now. I think there are some things that private businesses, with the goal of making money, should not be involved in. Health insurance is one of them. Roads are another. I prefer public schools. I prefer a government run military than a private military.   I do, however, believe there is a way forward with fixing the ACA, and I would absolutely support doing that if thats what happens, but I want to fight for M4A because I think it is the best.  I have no idea if Bernie's M4A plan is the best, but I think it is a better step in the right direction than fixing the ACA. I also think that each candidate is flawed. I think both Bernie and Joe can beat this disaster in chief. I hope its Bernie, but I like Joe and I will happily vote for him in November if he wins the primary.
I've had a Bernie supporter tell me to burn so that I can test out Joe Biden's insurance plan. lol So toxic.

You are on the right track. You named a couple reasons to vote Bernie. Here are the other reasons. https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/bernie-sanders/ hope that helps.
Yeah, I hope it’s not a repeat of 2016 where the primary goes all the way to the convention. Being unable to pivot to the general until pretty late hurt Hillary. Bernie has to realize that all these attacks against Joe are just going straight into the republican playbook. I’d prefer if he stuck to his own message and just wait to see if the voters want it or not.
Part of the establishment, you can tell by the (D) after his name
That’s a lot of words just to say malarkey dude
That's pretty interesting. I am more practical over idealistic, but is it actually true that Biden enforced segregation and praised Thurmond? I don't think that people are permanently tied to their past (they can redeem themselves and I think Biden has, especially since black people voted for him en masse), but I just would like to get the complete story. Thanks!
Yeah I never can get them to answer why their campaign specifically (not others) is a movement.. Joe is getting near there because he is a decent dude looking to pump the brakes on Trump and get things on track the moving forward at quick pace .. add Pete + Amy + Beto and this coalition of aspiring leaders really makes for a movement.. decency upon decency with ROTR and other conduct rolled into the fold.   I think with Bernie they are saying that he isnt just their guy, it's a personality cult
Just saying it's a movement does not denote size.
Bernie's M4A is not truly M4A. His version will kick millions off their insurance. Andrew Yang's is much better and similar to Germany's. Joe Biden is similar to Yang in that he wants to tackle the root cause of healthcare which is cost.  Also I like that Biden is pro nuclear while Bernie is anti-science when it comes to nuclear energy. France is the #1 in nuclear atm. Bernie doesn't understand modern technology whereas Biden takes talking points from Andrew Yang concerning automation and the loss of jobs in our country.  Wind and Solar power only account for 8% of our energy sources. There was a power plant shut down in Vermont which caused fracking and they had to rely 3x on coal to make up for the loss in energy.  Why is Bernie still advocating for something that doesn't work? I've no idea. He is too prideful and afraid to admit he is wrong. When asked about jobs lost due to automation, he just brushed it off saying it's not the cause. In the end, I am voting for the person with the best policy.  I disagree with Biden in raising the military budget.
I know I have no chance of swaying your opinion, but I like the mental exercise anyway.   1.Medicare for all *might* save us money. Some studies say it will, others say that the eventual bump in taxes would be very extreme. What does this mean? We have no idea whether or not it will save money. It does NOT mean that you will never have to pay a penny for healthcare again. You will, it will just be through taxes.   Single payer healthcare plans (like M4A) are only active in 3 countries: Canada, Taiwan, and North Korea. Other countries have different versions of universal healthcare, some (like Australia) that are more similar to Joe’s plan of a government option. Everyone can be/is insured, thus it’s another method of universal healthcare.   Increasing medical costs come from medical centers having to pass the cost down from people who are unable to pay for it and don’t have health insurance. You need everyone to be on health insurance, whether that is like M4A that consolidates all options and wipes out a sector of the economy, or if it’s an established, cheaper option. They are both solutions for the same issue, and we frankly have no idea which would work.   2.I can get behind helping with student loan debt, but I don’t think it should be eliminated completely. Biden’s plan makes the payback on loans more reasonable while making community college free. That is a measure that will benefit more of the country than just college graduates. In 2018, only about 35% of people 25 and up held bachelor degrees. That number went up to 37% when looking at ages 25-30. So, abolishing all student debt would help with 2/5 of the country. Helpful? Possibly. But is it a measure that everyone should support because it will help everyone? Not necessarily. It statistically doesn’t help the average American because the average American doesn’t have a college degree.   Even in poorer areas, the problem comes down to public schools. Generally, low income areas also have low performing schools with high dropout rates, low graduation rates, and lower college bound students. Most of those kids are not being held back by money, it’s the system itself that is stopping them. In short, they are not ready for college because the institution that *should* have prepared them failed.   Community college is generally the first step for people who complete their GED. Making that free not only gives them the ability to test higher education to see if that is something they can/want to do, but it also gives them the chance to build up skills that are lacking in many college students. To add to this, community college credits are (for the most part) transferable. You can take non-major classes there (so, GE stuff) that you would have to take at a four year institution anyway. Two years of taking GE not only gives someone a chance to figure out what they want to do (because they experience a lot), it also saves the two years worth of GE classes they would have had to take at a 4 year.   So, not only does Biden *have* a plan (and I didn’t talk about the specifics of the student loan forgiveness, but I would be glad to), but it’s solid and reasonable.   3.I don’t know as much about climate change. I *do* know that Bernie’s calls for an elimination of nuclear power. Once again, I haven’t had time to research that issue yet, but I do believe the idea that in order to go 100% clean energy, we are going to need nuclear energy.   4.The inequality gap is something that affects a lot of voters. It is also rather vague, as there are many types of inequality. I assume you’re referring to the wealth gap? Biden also supports taxing the rich; in fact, his healthcare plan (which wouldn’t be near as costly as Bernie’s) plans to only tax the rich to fund it, although this is unlikely. He will most likely need to raise taxes to fund it as well.   He speaks to the concerns of older voters, especially black voters and the inequality they deal with. He’s spoken about/to LGBTQ+ community and discussed the inequality they have received. I don’t know if he has spoken about or to young voters (although I would be willing to bet a lot of money that he has), but I know he supports them and their issues based on his platform.   As to your point about hypocrites, yes, there are complaints about Bernie Bros. But I’m a hypocrite. You’re a hypocrite. Biden is a hypocrite. Bernie is a hypocrite. Everyone is a hypocrite. I’m a hypocrite for pointing out a hypocrite pointing at hypocrites. For me, it’s cathartic seeing those things on here. I see hate, I see people with other opinions getting shouted down, and it’s nice to see that I’m not the only one who dislikes those attacks. In some senses, defending some of the more radical attacks is a refuge  Biden has attracted more of the actual working class than Bernie has. More members of that working class have voted for Biden than they have for Bernie.   Try not to make sweeping generalizations about a broad and diverse voting base, as Biden has proved his is. We all care, we just differ in how we go about getting those things.
The reason I don't support M4A is because I don't have any idea what effect it will have on people currently employed in the health care industry. I've also seen my mom sign up for Medicare and it's a nightmare. And I like my employer plan and want to keep it.   Bernie's speculation tax is untested in a modern financial sector, and is a reckless way to pay off student debt.   >You dont care about the working class. You probably got yours and dont give a fuck about others.  And there it is. Thanks for proving my point. If I was a "fuck you I've got mine" type I'd be a Republican.  Edit, reply in comments or not at all. Sending me a private message to cry about what a horrible person I am and how shitty your life is gets you a quick block.
I don't actually want M4A. I want the ACA expanded and I want a public option. M4A will never pass and his speculation tax won't either, so he's nothing but empty promises.  My point in saying that though, is that no one has actually tried to pull me in. Bernie's group is exclusive. We need an inclusive candidate who welcomes everyone.
Bernie says its not about winning, its about changing the party. Ok if true. But going negative doesn't change the party. Thats what you do if you value winning at any price.
How did Biden enforce segregation? The timeline doesn’t add up unless I’m confused
True indeed
True indeed
True indeed
True indeed
Well Bernie is about the issues. If you don't agree with that list then you should vote for someone who agrees with you more. I am not as worried about whether someone seems welcoming to me or not. I am more concerned with my views being represented.   Go watch some videos from Robert Reich (Clinton"s labor secretary I think it was) He does a great job of explaining some of the issues that Bernie talks about so much. I think his series is called the Common Good.   The way I think about it, we should make sure that everyone has the basics (food, shelter, education, healthcare etc) before people start hoarding billions in resources.
Right, we can’t be held hostage and keep losing to republicans for not changing sufficiently.
Do you think pointing out Joe's views/votes and how the are different is negative? I have not seen any of the negative stuff from the Bernie camp yet. Do you have any links?
I think the arguments I've seen were his stance on busing, as well as his eulogy for Thurmond who was a segregationist.
Bernie people dominate the internet. If you haven't seen "Biden voted for the WAR because WARMONGER Bernie only voted for a civil regime change Biden is SENILE because he misstated stuff Bernie used wrong names in interviews because absentmindedness is normal" you must not have read *anything*.
For busing many of the people being bused were opposed simply because of how many hours their children would be commuting each week; it's an important tool to fight racial inequality but also a logistical challenge and legally it can be difficult to implement
Ah okay, so there were some pragmatic issues with busing. What about Thurmond though?
In politics you make nice with people you disagree with to get things done. I know that doesn’t sound right in our time, but that’s actually how things work.
Gotta say, as a  foreigner interested in American politics, I really enjoyed this exchange.
Originally a Pete Supporter. Just Voted for Joe in California. Let's do this thing!
Me too! So proud of how the party is coming together. We're Pete to Joe voters from the 46th Congressional District.
Thank you!
[deleted]
Pete to Joe here too!
I early voted for Joe in CA over the weekend. Are you in SD? My ballot looks similar.
Isnt it illegal to photograph the ballot?
I too voted for Joe, not excitingly mind you, but the best option remaining. Hoping his campaign excites me more as we move forward, happy to see the rules of the road being added to this subreddit as well.
I'm a Pete supporter from SC, so I got to vote for Pete- we voted Saturday. I know it had to be tough voting today and selecting Joe, but I admire you for doing it. The speeches from both of them last night carry a lot of weight for me, along with how welcoming Biden's supporters have been.
The wife and I had to destroy our mail in ballots (She was for Pete, I was for Liz) and we both filled out provisional ballots at the polling station today for Joe. There were A LOT of people doing provisionals, and while I didn't ask anybody, I have a feeling they were doing the same as we were. Early numbers in Cali are going to favor Sanders since there were so many people to vote for, but don't give up on California just yet! In California we're allowed to mail our ballots up to 3 days AFTER the primary, and you can bet those late mail ins are going to be mostly for Joe.    ...and before anybody asks, I switched from Liz to Joe because the writing is on the wall for Liz. I'd have voted for Pete if he was still in the running, but since he's out, Joe it is.   Now, I just had a showerthought earlier today. Wouldn't it be fun to create a PAC for Joe of veterans and active duty military called GIs for Joe? =)
Wow, the randomized names for our ballots are very similar: https://i.imgur.com/RRgafyt.jpg.  Only difference is Joe Sestak is at the top for me and Bernie Sanders was dead last (where he belongs?)
Let's goooooooo!!
It's nice that your down vote options had at least minimal descriptions.      In NC, it was just formal names, no other info. I had spotty reception at the center and it took a while to go through the list.       In hindsight, I should have been more prepared, but there were a crap ton of names.
Cool post.   Amy was my first choice. I waited 'til after South Carolina and voted for Joe yesterday (in Colorado).
Should have voted for that Rocky guy he’s got the best name I’ve ever seen lmao
Amy -> Joe, California!
I know I overpost this.  If only Kamala endorsed Joe before Super Tuesday , California would have fared better
Fellow Californian supporter here. I was unsure for a long time who I would back after Harris dropped out, but Biden has convinced me that he's the man who can bring this party together to defeat Trump.  Fittingly, you know what came on the radio as I was driving home? Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  Let's go Diamond Joe!
Why are people who dropped out still on the ballot? I know it was already printed before Pete and Amy, but Booker?
Just as an aside, Darrell Issa is back?  Is he expected to pick up that seat?
I’m also in the 50th District!
Who the heck are half of those people?
Thank you for joining the 🚂💎💎💎💎💎💎
#Woo Hoo!
3rd here
Nice!
Yup Lakeside. There weren't very many people voting when I was at my polling place so I wonder if most early voted like you. Then again Lakside is heavily Republican territory so maybe the Republicans aren't turning out. Or could just be I showed up at a slow moment ha ha.
Me too. (Orange County)  Love the early voting.
In some states it is. But, it is legal in California I checked beforehand :)
My 19 year old daughter voted for the first time in SC for Pete. I voted for Joe. Now she is behind Joe all the way.
For me he was at the bottom
This is because California doesn't randomize the names for each ballot. They create a randomized alphabet that rotates based on Assembly District.
Hey, another Colorado voter that supports joe!
LOL. His name is on the ballot for multiple offices. I've seen him other years too. Great name!
Presumably because they dropped out after the filing deadline.
He was leading in the polls last time I checked. I voted for Campa-Najjar (Dem) hoping he makes it to a run off in November polling was showing him in second behind Issa. Race has been really nasty between Issa and Carl Demaio his closest Republican rival.

I mean it **should** be illegal everywhere. When you are allowed to see markings on official ballots then it let's say vindictive, controlling parents or bosses ask their kid's or workers if they voted "right" and punish them if not.
I hope Joe is the nominee. I'm not sure I'll be volunteering much until the nominee is decided, mainly because I need a break over the next few weeks. I was either canvassing or texting for Pete EVERY DAY for about the last month, and I have a full-time job. So I'm taking the next few weeks to decompress and get rested up for November :).
Ah ok. Not sure how this worked.
Sanders can’t lead the Democrats if his campaign treats them like the enemy
Nobody should be surprised that he hasn't even tried to unite Democrats, he isn't even one.
Sanders has been a protest candidate his entire life..       Its the only thing he knows how to do...     That is why he is running a protest candidacy against the very party that he is trying to run for.      Bernie is essentially running against the democrats and the republicans both at the same time...    That isnt going to work.     Also, there is a much larger contingent of Democrat supporters for the past 30 years that are not in the mood to completely reject all the work that has been made this far from Clinton to Obama. No one wants to throw all that away just because some dude is offering Free Everything.       protest candidate is going to protest
What I hear when I read this: "You can't love a country if you hate half of the people in it. Let's do better with love of country. Let's use it to motivate us to protect one another."
"The Party sucks and I SHOULD LEAD IT !"
And his followers can’t expect to convert anyone when they chastise, belittle and cheat the competition (videos of Berners telling Iowans and NH while canvassing and phone banking that Yang dropped out and to vote for Bernie instead) leading up to present day.   No way I’m voting for Bernie...nice guy with heart in the right direction, but he has ZERO bipartisan support for his policies because he’s too busy fighting and protesting everyone. Heck, he can barely get Dems to support his ideas.
Ezra Klein the YIMBY goat
It should also be pointed out that in every state that has voted so far Bernie has underperformed his 2016 numbers, generally by a LOT. (He tied them in Nevada)
Sanders really had a chance to come out as the front runner after NV to form a coalition of the majority. His stunning blowout and his strong performance among the Latino communities showed that he was a serious candidate.  He could have reached out at that point to the other former candidates like Booker and Beto as well as other candidates running like Warren and Amy to try to consolidate and form a majority coalition with promises of platform change and cabinet positions to get them onboard.   Instead he said screw it, I only need my 30%. He was busy taking victory laps and busy attacking the "establishment". Well, yesterday was the result of that folly.   Remember everyone, build bridges not bern them down.
The minute Bernie was the front runner everyone was like, yeah, nah.   Wait, actually, other demographics of electorates got the chance to fucking vote!
Vox banned on s4p when?
after the entire 2016 campaign with the same shit I'm so fucking HERE for the 2020 vibe of "actually fuck BernieBros that shit's messed up" everyone's waking up to in the MSM
All of this exactly. On point.   You can’t attack the very same establishment you are running to be the leader of.  The “If you are not 100% on board with my policy then you are the enemy” stance of Bernie is worrying, especially for the down ballot Dems.   No every candidate will share your view, but you have to support them all, not treat them as the enemy.  Down ballot matters. Sanders and his supporters ignore the fact that the progressive agenda is good as nothing if you don’t have a Democratic House and Senate.
People keep forgetting, he is not a democrat!!! He joined the party for the run because there is no independent party.
This is a great article about governing and working with people.
Whether you like the Hill's Rising or not (I know most probably don't), they had an excellent postmortum on Super Tuesday. So, my primary issue in any given race is racial justice, so in any given post you will hear me bring up race -a lot-. But this was really good. The commenter noted that for a lot of ethnic minorities in the South, the Democratic Establishment has been the *only* protection they've had from Republican hegemony. Racism exists everywhere, but there is a visceral *feel* to it and in a lot of places, some hopelessness after decades of that oppression. But the people persist, and if you're saying you're bringing down the establishment, well who do you think has been helping the people out there all along?
It's stunning how many Democrats don't objectively see Sanders as an Independent who runs as Dem only when it suits his needs. Then he bashes the Democratic ("establishment") Party his entire campaign. He takes advantage of the DNC while lambasting and demolishing it.  How could one possibly be any more transparently Democrat in Name Only?

Bernie needs to watch Survivor and Mr Rodgers.
\^This, plus many of his more fervent supports' identities, similar to Trump's supporters, are rooted in being outraged outsiders.  It's either Bernie's way or no way.  Trump's election to power was primed by the rise of the Tea Party, a faux grassroots movement, backed by those who had an incentive to push a deregulation agenda, and who used bullying tactics to force alignment with their ultra right-wing agenda.  I for one don't think Tea Party tactics will work with most Dem moderates and older voters.  Biden has been called pollyannaish for talking about the days when Congress regularly worked across the aisle, but many voters are tired of the divisiveness and continual outrage.  Older voters, too, remember those days. The Super Tue results reinforced that.
This is a really great take.
Half? He hates republicans too. Lol
The problem is that most democrats like the democratic party, and when he shits on the democratic party, those democrats take it personally.   For Trump it was different because republicans felt disconnected from their party after the disaster of GWB and he was able to tap into latent nativism and feelings of white insecurity. Their party wasn't very diverse and therefore it was easy to capture segments at the expense of outgroups.
I was a Buttigieg supporter but I donated $4 to Bernie early in his campaign and was bombarded with texts every day to donate. Okay, fine. Then after Iowa i started getting texts painting Pete in a bad light and talking about how he was in the hands of Billionares. I blocked those numbers after that. I couldn't believe how they painted another candidate who genuinely wants to help the country and had a vision to do so. The world isnt so black and white that you are right and everything else is wrong. Severely turned off by his campaign after that.  If he does get the nomination i will vote for him, but nothing before that.
What is yimby goat? I'm curious
I guess it shows how disliked Hillary was and many Democrats (and probably now Republicans) voted for Sanders as a protest. It makes me sad.
He joined it because socialism and communism are the extremes of the left. He only calls himself a democratic socialist because he wanted to slip himself in there. If socialism becomes more “cool” he will drop the democratic part in a heart beat. He has never fails to say kind words about evil communist regimes and that’s very telling of where he’d like to take America
Bernie is a grumpy guy.
YIMBY is yes in my backyard, goat is greatest of all time
Trump says a lot of kind words about the likes of Putin, Kim Jong Un, Erdogan ....etc.
You see him get mad he turns straight up purple lol
Thanks. It seems Bernie stans forgot to vote. For weeks, I've been seeing his annoying north korean level propaganda on r all. Are they gonna stop now?  PS: I'm not American
I know, that is true, but he also just does on a strategic level to try and get what he wants from these countries. They got nukes pointed at us, I wouldn’t want to be mouthing off about them either. Bernie has supported what he has just because he likes them, he had no power then but still talking wonders about these communist regimes. That would be the difference. But it’s a decent arguing point but doesn’t excuse Bernie regardless
That's not good for his health, his blood pressure has to through the roof.
Were you around in '16? They're just getting started.
Certainly, not excusing Bernie. Friend or enemy...not that simple in the real word, most often, sadly is defined by when and what we want....
No, joined reddit in dec. 2017.   Back then it was Trump bad, now its Bernie is Christ reincarnate. I'm assuming some of the posts have more upvotes than actual votes cast for him.
Bernie was losing the primary to Hillary almost just as bad as he’s losing to Joe now.  She almost won a majority of pledged delegates outright.  However, Bernie stayed in the race far longer than he should have and beat up Clinton when she could have been focusing on the General Election.   This is sadly Bernie’s modus operandi.
In Call for Unity, Ocasio-Cortez Says She'll Back Biden If He's the Democratic Nominee.
AOC can come off as an ideologue but is much less than she seems. Coming out this early was a cool thing to do. She also calls herself a democrat, fights for what she believes in and said the public option would be a huge win where bernie said he wouldn’t settle that single payer is already a compromise
Yes, because she doesn't want to be left completely out in the cold.  Her endorsement of Bernie over Warren is going to haunt her the rest of her career.
It’s pretty important to remember that, despite how divisive Bernie’s rhetoric can be, there are _plenty_ of Democrats who favor social programs that also believe strongly in party unity. Progress is progress. The notion of “all or nothing” is incredibly immature and contributed greatly to the mess we’re in with Trump.
AOC wants to get reelected. I've noticed she hasn't been as vocal about Bernie for a while.
She's much more politically astute than Bernie.
I feel like she needs to reaffirm herself as a democrat tbh  This “squad” has been attacking the party and it’s unhealthy for us. When we write a platform, that’s the fucking platform - and we all work together to get it done   What we don’t need is bullshit complaint politics stopping progress and dividing us on issues.   That’s my hope, we nominate Joe - the whole big tent gets in a room and writes the platform that we all walk out and commit to.
I appreciate that she is taking this position, but I'm not going to pretend like her and the Squad (minus Ayanna Pressley) haven't been incredibly divisive and harmful to the Democratic Party.  Their rhetoric over the past year and a half has perpetuated a lot of the vitriol coming from the Bernie Bros.
She just got cancelled probably lol
Thank You AOC.
I mean, that's nice and all, but isn't it sort of the bare minimum for a sitting Democratic congresswoman to back the Democratic nominee in a general election?
Good. Biden isn't my first choice, obviously, but he isn't a bad guy or a bad candidate. This isn't like Bloomberg coming in and buying the nomination. We know Biden and he won fair and square. I wish things had turned out differently but I can definitely live with a President Biden.
Calls for unity like this are exactly what the party needs and should be applauded. The big tent covers everyone.
Now if Sanders drops out of the race, tells Biden the ball is in his court, and tells voters to go vote their conscious.... that would be an amazing end to this whole episode.
I'll support Biden if he's the Democratic nominee without hesitation and I'm literally a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. All that I ask from you is respect: don't call us "Bernie Bros", try to take up parts of Sanders' platform. Making college tuition free is cheap, we now have a moment to remake America's healthcare system: please use it. Half of Biden supporters want Medicare for All in some form if you believe exit polls.   Joe Biden is a decent guy. He's not who I want, not even close, but I think most Sanders' supporters believe that he has good intentions as a person. If you give us a seat at the table, this will be easier. If you accept that we're not part of some cult but, rather, sincerely agree with Sanders on the issues, this will be easier.  We've been scolded for our conduct and behavior. I accept that there's some validity there. If you've been lecturing us, please return the favor and take what I've said seriously: please treat Sanders' supporters with respect.
Yeah this is to fight off her primary opponent.
All this is, is her seeing the reality of her situation and fearing for her political viability
Well that's pretty nice of her.
Looks like the fear of primary is real.
Thank god.
I immediately feel bad for her and the inevitable labeling as a "sell-out" or "secret establishment".
I like AOC. I do not care who she endorses, she is pretty neat.
The Bros are not going to like this.
She might survive this election season after all but she’ll be branded a traitor.
I don't like her or the rest of the squad. She has been trying to primary other democrats and has been coming up short. It's like she fights the Dems more than the Repubs. I'm sick of her and I hope she loses her seat. I hope Omar loses her seat too.
I think AOC is also still just really young, and I could easily see her turning into someone more pragmatic like Warren than like Sanders. She's obviously an extremely talented politician and has a bright future.
I really like the way she burns Republicans. I just wish she'd grow out of this "other Democrats are the enemy" phase, recognize that legislation always needs to pass with the support of the most moderate members you need to get to 50 %, and recognize that some of those moderates would be replaced by Republicans if the moved any farther left. We aren't going to get more progressive legislation with purity tests. We'll get there by having fewer Republicans in office and more Democrats, because we can pass a lot more if we only need 95 % of Democrats than if we need 100 % including Joe Manchin, or if we need help from Murkowski or something.  In the short term, she could play a valuable role in preventing some Bernie-or-busters. And she might have a bit of an epiphany when she sees the vile sexist treatment that's coming her way from Bernie-or-busters after Bernie loses and she endorses Biden.
> that single payer is already a compromise  ???  If single payer is a compromise to Bernie, wtf is his ideal plan? I shudder to think of that abomination
If you look at AOC compared to Omar, it's not even close. AOC is much brighter and definitely has a long future in politics. Yes she subscribes to the purity tests as "having morals" and yes she tends to parade herself as above others, but for the most part she is at least tolerable.
I believe we have to make room for folks like Alexandria in the Democratic party or we will lose this country. In my opinion, Alexandria is a talented and hard working politician who the Democrats should embrace whether they agree with the specifics of her progressive plans or not. We need everyone we can get to beat Trump and then to fix his messes.
I think she is more likely to mainstream than continue firebranding. Politics is a team sport folks.
She will make an amazing President one day in the future
She has made a lot of rookie mistakes since she took office.    But she *is* a rookie, so what can you do?
Honestly, I hope Joe jumps on this opportunity.      Either champion one of her bills, or help her build a progressive's run at a seat (not opposing another dem).
My respect-o-meter dropped for AOC that day. I was like sigh.
As far as I can tell she’s all talk. :/ still waiting for her to actually do something constructive besides blasting twitter.   I miss the old guard.
What caused Trump was decades of neoliberal globalisation and Democrats becoming out-of-touch cultural elitists.
She was literally on MSNBC praising his campaign yesterday.  She is saying what sander himself has said.  They will be backing whoever is the nominee.
She absolutely is.
As Nancy Pelosi said, if you want to do something more then get the votes.  It's not that Pelosi is resistant to some of the things people are fighting for, she just knows what will pass the House and what can pass the Senate.
So she’s being smart? Sounds like a good person to have on your side!
Yeah at the end of the day, despite a lot of heat for her from moderates on here these days, I think AOC has an overall positive presence as a public servant and she is genuinely trying to help people. I don’t think the Bernie platform of trying to immediately accomplish those goals will be effective but having her in the political spotlight long term will help progress some very good movements in society
I'm fine with it, because every Sanders supporter I know (in real life) would have even voted for Bloomberg in the general if we had to. We know what's at stake. This could be our last fair-ish election in this country..
"The Bros" aren't a real thing outside of some corners of the internet. The vast majority of Bernie supporters agree with her on this.
The words she had to say about Warren when she dropped out really improved my opinion of her. No sandbagging, no ill will, no trying to push one way or the other. She just gave Liz praise, praise Liz deserves.  She's starting to become the only member of the squad I've got respect for.
I certainly hope so. Calling Biden a Republican was deeply offensive and tainted my opinion of her considerably... I do see her potential but up to this point she (and certain other surrogates) have clearly been influenced by the culture of the Sanders campaign.
> She's obviously an extremely talented politician  I'm a fan of her, but what's the evidence of this? Her primary accomplishment thus far is winning a low turnout primary in a 90% Dem district. Most of her endorsements in 2018 & 2020 were failures.
Speaking of Senators: Louisiana lost a really great Senator in Mary Landrieu in 2014. She was just about the most conservative Democrat, but that meant she brought TONS of money to the state and she voted for Obamacare. She lost her seat over that act. That's the reality of American government. You can't get radical left bills though the system. You need to understand the political reality of the system. Mary put her political career on the line for a bill that Progressives just want to throw away. They think they can get something even more leftist through Congress when Obama stretched a Democratic Congress literally as far as it could go.
I like AOC overall though I have issues with some things, but she deserves credit for focusing her primary efforts on blue districts not swing districts. Absolutely some of these very moderate older Dems in deep blue districts need to be replaced by people who hold values more in line with the hue of the district.
100% Agree.
His ideal version is probably the UK's NHS. Government-run hospitals, not just government financing. A single-payer system, one that keeps private hospitals is a compromise
What's wrong with Omar?
I’m with you. I love diverse ideas in the party. I love people who push their colleagues who call each other out on their record sand challenge incumbents. It’s how a functional and healthy party should operate leaving room for diverse ideas, having healthy debate discussion and disagreement while working toward the same goal. I love being in a party with AOC and joe manchin. I love that each feel free to fight for what they believe. And at any given time let the most compelling case win.   Where I’m critical of bernie is he doesn’t call himself a democrat and when he goes past policy into feeding a conspiracy theory narrative of everyone but him and his are corrupt bought and sold corporatists.
Not run off employers and endorse populists over strong female candidates.
She could try being humble
Maybe stop acting like she's a rep who has 10+ years and take a step back to learn.  She's the equivalent of fresh out of college grads that come into a workplace with no experience and try to completely change something they have no understanding off. So annoying
Our boy Joe has made some not so amazing choices, especially early in his career. Let's give her some slack and build a bridge like Joe!
Get better or get out.
> neoliberal globalisation  What do you mean by this?
Yes, we know you don't care about LGBT, black, and immigrant issues, or as you call them, Identity Politics. Like a lot of working class white people, you're only out for yourself.
what caused trump was the fact that the republican primaries are winner-take-all. if they had proportional votes like the dems do we'd have president rubio or cruz right now.
She’s one of the better people in the Bernie movement
i know   its tyranny of a vocal minority,   same people that wreck everything.
She also had a tweet where she basically told people off for online bullying.,..not in those exact words, obviously, but something about how being online should be "inclusive". Plus, I do like that she didn't make an effort to get Warren's voters..the tweet was all about her respect for Warren herself.   \*I think most people don't consider Ayanna part of the squad anymore, especially as she broke from the others on several votes and backed Warren, but Ayanna and AOC are the ones with a bright future imo.
Doesn't the "squad" include Ayanna Pressley? She was originally a Warren supporter but I haven't heard much of her since
To be able to garner the sort of following she has isn't a coincidence, nor is unseating an incumbent.
>Absolutely some of these very moderate older Dems in deep blue districts need to be replaced by people who hold values more in line with the hue of the district.  Agreed. I generally want the country to move to the left on policy, just to do so in a pragmatic way that actually delivers and maintains progress.
Yes I think the party of diversity and tolerance should tolerate differences and a diversity of opinions as well. Although I would personally would love to enact policies as progressive as the Dutch, the lack of tolerance of various solutions to problems and the victim complex are two things that turned me off Senator Sanders years ago.
She came in thinking she was going to be part of a wave that would push the party farther to the left.  She miscalculated.
What do you mean? How should she be humble?
She's getting there. I don't like her policies but I see a visible difference in attitude towards more moderate Dems that do real work vs when she first started. She's a talented politician and if she can keep her seat I bet she'll end up being a better ally in the long run, and a progressive that may actually be able to do some things.  Should have endorsed Warren though. What the fuck was she thinking to go with Bernie?
As a woman, I know how tough is is to be "likeable" and also succeed in this country. I think it's probably even harder for female politicians.  In her defense she would not have won her seat if she sat back and waited her turn. Her heart is in the right place. She works hard and I respect that in a person. I was young once and believed I could change the world in years not decades. I think she is an asset to Democrats and she will learn and get better with experience.
They’re a troll, don’t feed them
Making huge strides in eliminating world poverty is bad.
She broke off from them a while back imo.
Exactly. We need a steady push to the left that allows Dems to win Elections but not be satisfied with the status quo.
Very True.
Close, she thought she was a leader of the wave.  Progressives flipped zero purple districts in 2018.  Justice Democrats won zero seats in the recent elections/runoffs.    They're middling at kicking seasoned incumbents out of very blue areas.  They don't compromise, so they don't get even close to their goals.  In contrast, mainstream Democrats, Biden especially, were fighting for MFAWWI in the ACA.  It was Lieberman that held out and stuck a knife in it, not Biden or any other mainstream Democrats.  It's not a miscalculation. It's simply that the DSA types are simply not what 90% of America wants, when you look under the hood and get past the marketing.
She could have done that with Warren.  Warren had plans.  Warren had a track record.  Warren courted her as a true champion of what AOC claimed to believe.  Instead, she went with misogyny and populism to be achieved through "revolution" by a guy who once named a post office.  In a few weeks, Bernie will not only be out of the race, but out of the party (again).  Warren will still be a senator from MA, and then likely a powerful cabinet member.  Let's see how this goes for AOC.
Hard
When literally no one she endorsed won a seat in the 2018 midterms, she maybe should have self-reflected a bit?
She acts like a super star but is brand new to congress.    She represents one tiny district but acts like she is a huge deal.
> What the fuck was she thinking to go with Bernie?  Bernie is popular and she wants to be popular too.
I'm a woman and I'm management in a field where I'm often the only woman and the only person of color in a room. So I know first hand the kind of sexism that's often hidden behind a label of "likeable."  AOC won during an election year where voter turn out was low for that district and by drumming up support amongst wealthy young professionals who had recently moved into the area, not because she drummed up support amongst long term residents.   She also win by spreading lies about Joe Crowley. Who by the way was an extremely effective legislator and had been fighting for the people of that district for a long time. AOC has accomplished nothing since getting to congress.   She also had zero qualifications. She did an internship and some volunteering. She has not put in the time doing community organization and influencing policy from a grassroots level as many freshman elected officials have done.   So I’m sorry I don’t share your view. I think she has little to offer outside of populist, divisive rhetoric
I think they just backed different people, but they still support each other. Ayanna is a little older (not old!) and more practical in her governing style. I really like her.
Excuse me, but I believe he renamed *two* post offices
I guess I still don’t understand what you think she should do. Do you think she should have changed her stances? Should she not endorse people?  Some people endorsed Pete, Amy, and Warren, none of whom won the nomination. Should everyone who endorsed them also self reflect a bit?
I guess I don’t understand what you would you have her do? Would you like her to stop talking to the media? To stop expressing her opinion?
Sounds about right, thanks for sharing your thoughts. That’s kind of the impression I got from her after reading the kinds of things she says.
Bashing AOC isn’t a good look, let’s focus on the positive here that she’s trying to unite. She represents her constituents and whatever you think of how she got there, she hustled and got there. A good bartender anywhere in NYC has to be one of the quickest and wittiest people in the workforce. I’m a fan of her style of questioning in the House. She’s got a razor sharp way of getting to the core of an issue. Absolutely an asset to all of us.
Thanks for sharing those details. All that may be true but she outworked Joe Crowley. She wore holes in a pair of shoes and so she earned her seat. I also happen to think just being a bartender for a few years and all that entails qualifies a person to do fine at politics. I am unqualified and I am sure I could do better than plenty of those people. We will see how her career goes.
My bad, but only one as a Senator.
I think it depends on how you look at it. Imo she didn't, Joe Crowley has gotten a lot of progressive legislation through Congress over the years and it's not like he was sitting on his butt twiddling his thumbs while AOC was campaigning. It was different kind of work, but it was work. AOC has gotten a total of zero bills passed since taking office in the past four years.   I don't think being a bartender qualifies her. I don't think there's anything shameful about being a bartender but I don't think it indicates you're qualified to be a congress person. Most people in politics serve in local grassroots efforts that give them the knowledge they need to make connections, and get bills passed and write policy. You don't have to do this in an official paid capacity, a lot of people work for volunteer organizations doing this work. Or they serve on local city and district government positions or state positions first.   I hope you don't take this the wrong  way, but why would you say you're qualified to be in congress? What is it yoh believe Congress's does? It's not about Twitter. It's about building coalitions, writing policy, getting bills passed, negotiating support, etc etc. Why would you assume you would do a better job at it when you don't have any experience with it?
>I am unqualified and I am sure I could do better than plenty of those people.  I have very slightly more qualifications than AOC and am fully convinced I could not. I don't know nearly enough about the nuts and bolts of politics to get anything accomplished. There's a reason the usual route is local>state>federal. It's like an apprenticeship.
Credit is due where credit is due.
That's a great explanation. I guess I should have said I can do better than most of the republican congress people. It's hard to get into politics when you're not rich and you have to work multiple jobs and you do not know people but she did so she found something that Democrats seem to be lacking. Trump proved qualifications do not matter to the American people.   My experience with campaigns these days is just door knocking and other things for voter registration and turnout. But back in the day, in my youth, I thought I was going to save the world and be a politician. Well I was lucky enough to win a school thing that send one person per district to the capital for a behind the curtain politics  trip with our member of congress. We saw a lot of things and got to meet a lot of people. I learned that the only people really working were the young 18-20 year old interns. They are writing the bills. And the elected did not seem to give two shits except about getting re-elected. They were all rich and they did not know the real world. And I learned some other things that turned me off from politics. So no, I'm not qualified but if I had smart interns writing bills for me then I could damn sure get a few post offices open and that was enough to get a man almost to the presidency.

I think maybe you're underestimating Pete's qualifications. To my mind, an exceptional education plus service as an army officer plus being the mayor of a fairly large city make a good candidate. If he doesn't get the VP, I really hope he'll consider taking on one of Indiana's Republican senators.
I meant no disrespect. Small town mayors do not usually make it to presidential races. I was saying if Pete waited until he was "supposed" to run and "put in his dues" as the other poster was suggesting he would not have run as the mayor of a small town who lost his last state wide race by 30 points and came in 3rd for DNC chair. He would have waited until he won state wide office and had proven he could bring more than the 8000 votes that elected him as mayor.   Obama was criticized for being inexperienced with 6+ years in the senate and state and local experience. Beto was a 3 term congressman who got 500,000 votes from republicans in a state wide race that saw him earn 4 million votes and he was called inexperienced.
Whenever I see an r/politics post about Bernie "surging" in the polls
*Bernie goes up 1 point while Biden is still 12 points ahead*  r/politics post: DEMS SAY BERNIE HAS BEST CHANCE TO WIN NOMINATION AND GENERAL! MEDIA IGNORES SURGE IN POLLS.
I'm pretty sure that commondreams site writes headlines specifically for /r/politics clickbait lol.
Put your hand down for a second, Bernie.
Biden: devotes entire prolific career to promoting unions and improving working class quality of life  Sanders supporters: OMFG HE ATE DINNER WITH A MILLIONAIRE HE'S LITERALLY JUST AS BAD AS TRUMP! WE'RE WINNING THO BECAUSE THE POLLS ARE DISCRIMINATING AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ATTEND FURRY CONVENTIONS.

My concern about Biden was his introduction of the 1980's crime bill. The three strike policy, mandatory minimum sentencing, and changing crack to be a harsher punishment than cocaine has been a disaster for the black community.
[removed]
Obviously the only reason Biden is ahead in the polls is because nobody has heard of the other candidates.  I'm kidding of course but I find it funny that people still try to use that line.
populism is a cancer by its nature and leads to disaster and incompetence. it is not an option. and left wing populism has already demonstrated its electoral weakness in its demolition by hated Tories.
Bernie is solidly in second at the moment, no question.   https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-the-first-post-debate-polls-are-in-and-theyre-pretty-weird/

Guess what? Most politicians supported these bills. The 80's and 90's were a different time. Drastic measures were taken because there was no evidence at the time to say that it wouldn't work. Well, turns out it was the wrong way to approach the crime epidemic and we've been working at fixing it ever since. Biden has been part of that adjustment.
He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement? Wow, how damming! Fuck that dude for supporting free trade, right?
True, but state wide polls in NH and California aren’t as good for him. I like joe Biden as a person, I just don’t think he has enough grassroots support to win the primary.
Sounds like malarkey to me
Well yea... that literally hollowed out the middle class. Free trade is good for the consumer not the producer
you're assuming the dp superdelegates give a rat's ass about grassroots support (they don't). they want a nominee who can win - especially one who can attract enuf indies and disgruntled r's who don't like trump and don't want the social upheaval they've been told a candidate like bernie will cause.
CNN has projected that Joe Biden has won the Democratic primary in North Carolina!
A lot of Sanders supporters thought NC and VA were in the bag.
Our youth numbers are up and Bernie's older voters are down.
Another W on the board for Joe Biden!
Already getting tired of all this winning
Am I misremembering or was he favored in NC?  I thought he was close behind Bernie there.
Like Virginia, expected AND fantastic!
My brother moved to NC a few months ago from Michigan. He voted for the first time at 28 years old for Joe Biden. My daughter voted for Mayor Pete in SC and I voted for Joe in SC. Proud of the Biden Bounce back!
Proud of my state.
In our bag!!!
Polls had Bernie beating Joe in NC up until very recently cant blame em. Moral of the story praise our lord Clyburn
I remember hearing people over the summer surprised that Biden was in the race still.  The mass delusion on Reddit caused by the echo chamber effect is unreal.
Don't jinx please! 😨😨🙇🙇🙇
Look at the polls listed at FiveThirtyEight:  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/north-carolina/   There's been a massive surge of support for Biden since South Carolina.   A High Point University poll (A/B rated) had North Carolina at Sanders +13. Biden was in third place at 14%.   Look at the more recent polls. They put the spread anywhere form Biden +9 to +27. It's insane!
💎 ALLAH WILLS IT 💎
I don't really think Clyburn has that much pull in NC.
Seriously, never underestimate TeamPete. Biden got most of us, and that at least doubled his support, if not more....
He doesn't, but his pull in SC was the explosion that set off that surge.
And also Klobu.  These 3 were my top picks, I'm glad they teamed up together.
I will be most interested to see if there's data on that tonight.
Dave Wasserman calls the WASHINGTON STATE PRIMARY for Joe Biden!!!
Sanders won the [2016 WA caucus 72-26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Washington_Democratic_caucuses) but only about 230,000 people voted.  WA also did a state-run primary which the Dems ignored for delegates, which Hillary won 52-48% out of 800,000 votes.  Already today, with 300,000-400,000 ballots left to count that will likely lean heavily Dem, almost 1.1 million Dems have voted.
https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1237882153536380928  >Sanders gets a better result in Spokane, where he wins today's ballots by 8, 50 to 42, compared to a 31-31 split yesterday.  >Over all, Biden up 55-39 in the new ballots today, compared to Sanders by 1 in the same counties in the initial county
Beautiful!
**WE CAN'T STOP GETTING** ***HIGHER AND HIGHER***
How peculiar. Earlier on Twitter, I saw people saying WA was taking so long to be counted because Bernie won and the DNC delays the results when he wins to minimize his momentum and impact.
Ive Seen enough. Primary over.
I think the best primary site would be one that showed each state by delegate spread.  That's what really matters.  North Dakota: +2 Sanders.  Washington +0 each. California +50 Sanders. Mississippi +29 Biden. Etc.
Joe has a lot more votes   Those things are supposed to matter   It mattered last week when some people wanted warren to drop out
Sanders all but admitted this in his press conference today. It was a bad night for him last night.   I really liked Sander's press conference today, he recognizes that the end is near for his campaign. And he wants to take the opportunity of Sunday's debate to address how Joe is planning to heal the party. It's really divided right now. 70% of people under the age of 50 voted for Sanders, but there's just not enough of them voting (edit: voter suppression is obviously a factor, in general, it still holds true that young people didn't show up). The people over 50 overwhelmingly voted for Biden and there were more of them voting.  There has to be a fine middle ground here, we risk losing the general election if we just alienate the overwhelmingly popular policies that we found from the exit polls last night. Joe is going to get the nomination, but we can't just leave people behind.
No one else has. No one has won the state yet.
Congrats all! Getting Washington is huge!
[me, at this article](https://youtu.be/_QIFQENuZtE)
So the guy who's supposed to be responsible for energizing voters can only win low turnout caucuses lol.
Higher and higher
Now it will be that they needed the time to rig the votes in favor of Biden.
This is a pretty good state by state summary I like: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/democratic_delegate_count.html
Going back even further, Nevada. 98% of the Democratic electorate yet to vote? Too bad! Bernie is leading in votes and delegates so the DNC must listen to the voters and coronate Bernie.  Now that Biden is winning by a million votes and 100 delegates the DNC has apparently rigged again. These guys are a lost cause
I'm so confused about this. Bernie acknowledges he has no path and is using the debate Sunday to attempt to get Biden to commit to things the "progressive" base wants. However, if Bernie's goal is to be able to drop out by saying *"Biden agrees to all this shit we want, so he has my endorsement"*, then Bernie can't really go too hard after him in the debate or it will make Bernie look awful when he endorses a few days later. So it will be super interesting to see what the debate is like. Added to that, I thought the format of the debate was to answer questions from voter submissions so it seems hard for them to focus on each other directly.
If Sanders doesn't reach out directly and coordinate the approach, there's no going back.  It was good to give the cheat sheet of what's to come.  Next step is the two campaigns coordinating the tempo, flow, and what to hit and avoid.  This needs to be like a late-night talk show interview, everything pre-vetted.  This debate isn't the time for one side to score points on the other.  It's the time to show that we all want 80-90% of the same stuff, and how Biden and team plan to get there.
I'm a hardcore Bernie supporter but I think most rational people can see the writing on the wall. I'm also on the blue no matter who train but I really do think that Biden needs to address some of these popular policies that Sanders has, Medicare for all, and the abolishment of student debt. The party really is torn right now between the moderates and progressives, and while the moderates are definitely winning we still have a very large amount of progressives in our party that need to be addressed and shown that we're not just abandoning all their ideals. The only way we can win this election is if our party comes together. I'm definitely looking forward to this Sunday to see if Biden can give some concessions and hopefully bring our party together.
Sshhhh you can't say that on Reddit.  But yes, the lower the turnout, the better Bernie does, the higher, the worse he does. But yes, he's supposed to beat Trump, because reasons.
I see you're familiar with Sanders supporters.
Yeah, that's good. Thanks!
Wouldn't Biden risk alienating the moderate voters that got him to this point if he adopts a more progressive agenda though? That's a big chunk of the electorate as well. I can see Biden being more flexible on certain issues and being willing to compromise but not completely abandoning a middle ground. There are plenty of areas of agreement though such as $15 minimum wage, tackling climate change, universal health care. The way to achieve those goals differs however. Like Biden has said repeatedly he won't take away private insurance. Will he back away from that? I'm curious as to how they can find agreement on certain issues
His debate is an either or. Either Sanders will absolutely destroy Biden in a way that no one could ever come back from (the only way would be the dementia bullshit is slightly true which it isn't) or he'll have a public platform to tell his supporters to vote Biden giving him even more support.
> Bernie can't really go too hard after him in the debate  The summary of his campaign was that he didn't go hard enough against Biden which ultimately lead to his failure, and I don't suspect he will during the debate either. What I got from his speech today (which was essentially him admitting defeat) was that every single exit poll showed support for Sanders policies, but people wanted an electable candidate in Biden.  He wants to address what Joe plans on doing about those voters' policy stances, can't alienate them and risk losing the general election.
I'm reminded of Yang's early interviews on Fox and Fox Business, and they were some of his best because the interviewers gave him the questions folks at home would be thinking. It gave him a chance to directly address those concerns.  I'm not holding out hope for Sanders here, but he could play the same role. Basically "the youth vote clearly favors my platform and you're going to need them to win in November, so Joe, make your pitch to them."
What annoys me is that these "experts" on winning elections are never wrong.  2016: Talk about Trump is the more liberal candidate who'll appoint better judges on the bench while also saying he had better foreign policy instincts. 2018: AOC wins a primary in a deep blue district and everyone is like "The Progressive tide is taking over! RIP Moderate Dems!" and then the Justice Dems go like 6/65(including the Squad) and flip 0 red seats.  2019: Jeremy Corbyn backs Corbyn only to see him lose in embarrassing fashion after hyping him up for years.  2020: Talk about how Bernie is going to win the white working class and black voters while increasing voter turnout and when all 3 are wrong you go into conspiracies.  I'm done with these fuckers. Maybe if they admitted to being wrong sometimes I'd be okay with it but that's when the grift ends. Gotta keep doubling down and passing the buck
I'm not saying Biden will make ANY concessions, I'm just saying Bernie is trying to save face.
If Biden switched to M4A, I’d be livid, but that’s not happening.
Bernie supporter switching over
Welcome!  ask me if you need a rundown on any of Biden’s policies, a lot of people are surprised about how progressive he is.
Join the coalition, where all voices matter!
Awesome job in canvassing! I’m happy you are here! It feels sad when your candidate is not succeeding. I’m sorry. We are here for you!
I think almost all of us would have done the same if Bernie was taking the lead. I don't like him as much, but beating Trump is the top priority right now, and I know I would have been willing to jump ship if that's what it took. In the meantime, welcome aboard!
Welcome!!!! Glad to have you on board!!
Welcome! Most of us did not start out as Biden supporters from the beginning, but we all agree that, no matter our differences with each other, they pale in comparison to our differences with Trump.
Thanks friend. United we can fix this country and begin to heal.. if we are divided going into the general we will have 4 more years of Trump and decades of irreversible damage to the nation.
Hope you donate and canvass for Biden too. We need to unite as one
Welcome. Together we defeat Trump.
Welcome! A lot of us come from different candidates or parties. We are really glad to have you.
Welcome aboard, friend.
Welcome, friend! We're in this together.
Welcome to the team
Welcome!  May I also suggest that in addition to working to elect Joe Biden and your candidates of choice in the future, finding ways to get involved in your local party? Be it lobbying your local elected officials or in getting involved locally, you can make an impact in big ways in small geographic areas. Every small programs championed by a town council reminds people that government is good and has a positive impact in people’s lives.   I would love to see the Bernie movement translate from campaigning to public service like Obama did, turning Obama for America into Organizing for America.   That would be incredible.
Welcome!
Welcome!
Welcome! We can't do it without you!
Thank you and welcome!
Welcome to the club. Glad to have you on board.
You made democracy better and fought for something. That’s more than a lot of people can say.   We are all in it together to defeat Donald Trump.
Welcome to the big tent. 🏕💙🌊
We're all in this together, it's going to take all of us to get out.
Welcome aboard.   What's an issue you're passionate about?
This is a referendum on Trump
We're going to need amazing energy like yours to take down Trump in November.
Welcome. Former bloom supporter here.
Welcome!
People fail to realize that Joe may enact a more progressive agenda than Bernie.  Because Joe can deliver the Senate, and Bernie can't. You can see this based on who is motivated to vote.  Any Dem President with a Dem House and Senate can enact a ton of progressive legislation. If an angry Bernie got into the White House, he wouldn't be able to get anything enacted. Even most Democrats in Congress dislike him, to put it mildly.  Moreover, we "centrists" are mostly not less progressive. You can see this in the exit polling showing people support M4A but support Joe over Bernie. Because "centrists" are in reality pragmatists who are concerned about winning first. 2/3 of the party is very loudly demonstrating they know their swing voter peers and know Bernie would lose in the fall. The fact that the thinking of 2/3 of the party is completely foreign to Bernie voters only says that we're living in bubbles and the internet is broken.  Joe just wants his lifelong dream of being President. He's talked about 1 term. He said the other day he is "only a bridge" to a new generation of young leaders. He's going to let them run policy. And they know if they don't enact a progressive agenda, then they'll have no place in the future of the Dem party.
Welcome to the  BIG  FUCKING  TENT  Bernie did a massive service to the party by moving the conversation in a more progressive direction. Now it looks like universal healthcare and a dem surge are on the horizon!
Exactly!
Potentially donate, but as joe takes PAC money I don't think it's as necessary. Bernie didn't so the campaign was fully funded by us at the bottom.
I am an active member of the DSA but thank you for the idea :)
Medicare for all, income inequality and climate change.
Every dollar is needed to beat Trump. Make no mistake.
Awesome. What does the DSA do in your area?
Same. I'm also big on unions, labor and trade. As an Anarchist, i like policy that dilutes power to the many. I feel like that goes a long way to solving income inequality across the globe. I don't like that two people performing the same work can be rich in one place and starving in another.  Environment is huge... I live on Cape Cod, 35 feet above sea level on a giant sand dune. It's literally something I think of daily.  Welcome aboard. Looking forward to having some great conversation. Don't take any malarkey from anyone. :-)
Mikey B has enough dollars to go around.
Lots of campaigning and fundraising. I'm considering running for a local office with our party. But for this election I am definitely voting Biden. This is not a year to protest vote.
Thanks man. I hope Biden can absorb from leftist policies. Im a large proponent of workers coops and think they can truly thrive in the tech industry. We should be investing in our people to support ethical fair workplaces.
He's actually running an independent expenditure that's basically going to go after Trump and help to register voters, etc. It can't be used to support Joe Biden directly (like it can't run "positive Joe" ads) and it isn't under the control of the campaign. So it's so important that we keep up the grassroots donations for Joe as much as we can!
No shit!!! Coops in retail have been amazing. I just left the west coast for the east coast and I miss Winco and Bimart like crazy. (Oregon).  I have a soft spot for Joe because he and I both have connections to Scranton, PA. Old time Coal and union country. Real working class town. Hard scrabble people. So if you look through those glasses at Joe B., you'll see him a little more clearly. He's not all that you and I want, but he speaks to a wide group of people who know that kind of life.   Remember, this is the guy that took the train to work everyday into DC. He's the emperor of AMTRAK. So, think about huge upgrades to mass transit which is what we need for efficiency and to reduce consumption.   Ya gotta see light in dark places. I think you'll find some light here. I hope.
Oh yes if he makes a push for Nationwide high speed rail that would be awesome. Traveling in Europe and Asia it's shocking how far behind we have fallen.
Depressed And Disappointed Bernie Supporter Who Is Ready To Join Team Biden
It might be worth reading through Biden's policies, a lot of them are a lot more similar to Bernie's than you'd think and definitely count as progressive. I know what it's like to have the candidate you hope for not succeed -- a huge portion of us on that sub are supporters of Pete, Amy, Beto, Yang, etc originally -- but I think you might find some solace in the fact that while Joe might get there differently than Bernie, a lot of the end results of his plans would be the same.  [https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/)
I came to this sub after it was clear that Warren wouldn't be the nominee.   For a lot of us, we never thought of the other candidates & their supporters as the enemy. We are allies fighting for what we believe in and we have more similarities than differences.  If you check around this sub, we are coming from different camps - Pete, Amy, Yang, Bernie, Harris and we're all assembling together to do what's best for the country.
Wow, great post! This is probably the best post of have seen here from people coming over who are distraught over Bernie's loss.   Also I think you should take another look at Bidens climate, education and health plans. They might not be exactly what you want but I still things they are pretty good.  Zero net emissions by 2050, trillions to nuclear and climate technology research and re-entering the Paris Climate Accords on day 1 in office is pretty nice.  Free community college (basically everyone's first two years of college) and a loan repayment cap at 5 percent of income to be forgiven after 20 years of payment is pretty nice in my opinion.  Also I think his healthcare plan will help alot of people now even if it isn't helping everybody. Plus there are alot of nice details in it like linking drug prices to overseas prices, so if it's cheap in Canada it has to be cheap here.  Edit: oh and I forgot. Welcome aboard 😎👍.
Welcome. :) Please don't feel stupid for believing in a candidate. Most of us here supported other candidates before Joe this year, and many of us have supported other candidates in other elections that didn't pan out the way we'd hoped. If ever there's a time to vote with your heart, it's in the primaries. You can be proud to have done so.
Welcome! Don’t forget to take a look at the rules of the road we’ve brought over from the Pete campaign. You shouldn’t be anything but welcome here as long as you’re nice and civil to everyone as well. As someone who also had to except that their preferred candidate wasn’t going to make it through to the election don’t forget to take some time to grieve the future you envisioned. Hope isn’t lost, it’s just going to look a little different than some of us hoped. We can beat Trump together and help heal the nation!
You don't need to come to us on your knees.  Stand tall.  You did what you thought was right.    Now you are joining the team that is taking back the White House and going to give you over 80% of the things you wanted, but with a much higher likelihood.
I’m gonna echo other people in these comments and say that you don’t have to come here in defeat. We want you to join, we want you to be part of our coalition. We want your passion and your voice, you’ve got a seat at the table that’s gonna work to get Trump out of the White House!
Just saying the same as everyone else. It’s a coalition now... of the willing to boot Trump the fuck out of office. His platform is a lot better than Reddit is going to give him credit for and I think you’ll like many of his policies as well.
Welcome aboard and super glad you're here.  Loyalty and integrity are two very noble attributes and never apologize for it. It's people like you, loyal and making us live up to our better selves with integrity, that keeps this whole system together. People who truly believe in the cause got us the women's vote, got us the clean air act, got us civil rights, got us unions and labor laws. True believers see the world as it should be and there is something wonderful about it. Not all of us can be true believers, but damn are we rooting for you.  I hope you really find something that lights you up in Bidens plan for our country... I'm looking forward to working with people just like you in the upcoming months.
You seem like a very mature 19 year old.  And with that I say “Comtia” *throws confetti*
You should not feel stupid for voting for the candidate you believe in when they're on the ballot and in the running. You're doing this democracy thing exactly right.
Welcome!
Welcome, friend. You are not only welcome here, you are NEEDED here. Joe has always been a consensus builder. As the consensus of the party has moved left (in no small part because of Bernie), Joe has moved left with it. He knows he is only a bridge to the future. Get on board now, help us beat Trump, and there will always be a place for your voice here.
 > I can't help but feel stupid for believing that Bernie could do it, that he actually had a chance. Especially knowing that a lot of his moderate detractors have continuously pointed out how unrealistic he and his policies are, and his candidacy has unfortunately proved that more than anything. I was and am taking this especially hard because it's my first time voting, and I wanted to be a part of something historic.  I hope that I can convince you not to feel "stupid" or anything negative about yourself. You stood up and did what unfortunately few young people are doing - getting involved in the political process. You took time to research candidates and their positions. You took time to register to vote. And then you stepped up and voted to make this country better and makes the lives of your neighbors better. You've got nothing to apologise for or feel bad about. You should feel proud and patriotic.   The worst enemy of change is apathy that change can never come. Change in our big, complicated system takes time which can make it seem all to often like it's not happening. But we can make positive change by coming out and voting and participating not just once, but every year.  And we need people like Bernie Sanders to inspire us and show us a vision of where we want to get to. Sometimes that kind of visionary is not the best person to drive us to that destination, but that doesn't make them any less important to eventually getting there. Sanders and his supporters have made a significant positive contribution to the betterment of this country and I hope they don't stop contributing because America needs them to stay engaged and involved.  We're going to save this planet. We're going to give tens of millions more people healthcare. We're going to reform campaign finance laws. We're going to protect and extend voting rights. We're going to make this country better.
Vote for whomever you want to.  If Bernie's still in the race by the time it comes to your state, vote for him.  Make your voice heard.  But regardless of who ends up being the nominee, we need to unify and show up in droves this November.
Hey, we may not always see eye-to-eye, but in the grander scheme we're all in this together. Let us join hands, regardless of who wins, and walk hand in hand to help keep the US on the right side of history.
Glad you’re here my man! Now is the time to look forward to the great things that will come. I know Biden doesn’t seem as progressive as Bernie but like everyone said you’d be surprised how many great policies Biden has as well. All great change is incremental, especially in politics. We will get there. Welcome to the team!
We welcome you with open arms man. Listen, in the long run Joe’s policies will get us closer to what Bernie’s preaching faster than Bernie even could. He already called himself a bridge to the next generation. But right now, we need him. We need his expertise and ability to heal after this era. We need for once a leader we can all look up to and say we respect and are proud of. We need a bit of normalcy again, the soul of the nation is crying out for it—evidenced by Biden’s victories.  So let’s heal this country, together. All supporters are welcome. We are the Democratic Party, and we have to stop Donald Trump.
If you wanna be excited for Biden, look at when he's fucked up, and look at what he did after.   No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes and/or bad decisions.  But Biden really understands that he made a mistake and tries to rectify it.     Take Anita Hill.  He fucked that up, and it's a major fuck up, IMO.   But he knew he fucked that up and worked really hard on the Violence Against Women Act.  Now OP, you're a young guy, you don't remember what it was like before the VAWA.  I was young when it passed, but I remember.  My sister was date raped and the cops did NOTHING.  She spent 3 whole days in the hospital because of that degenerate scumbag, and he got away with it.   Date rape, spousal abuse, that was "domestic issues" (aka the patriarchy's favorite bullshit) and cops didn't get involved.   The VAWA changed that, and now not only do cops get involved, but abused women get the help they need to leave abusive relationships.  We need the VAWA reauthorized, republicans won't vote on it because they hate women.      So Biden took down a major policy of the patriarchy AND he went up against the NRA and won.    Maybe Biden isn't as progressive as Sanders, but I truly believe he's actually made more progress than most politians in this country.
i was a bernie #bro to until i was banned from r/berniesanders so now im team joe. We need to get more people on bored as we cant have a split party with two fires we need to get together to have more numbers and have a chance to defeat trump as every vote counts
Refreshing.  Welcome aboard   Thank you for your comment, made me day a little better
Welcome, and my sympathies.  Thanks for your careful thoughts.  Many of use are refugees from various first-choice candidates.  (Team Pete here.)  It hurts to give up on somebody you really, really wanted to see in office.  But the striking thing about Joe's campaign is that it really is a coalition, a team effort.  And remember - most policy actually comes from Congress, not the President!  The bigger we win Congress, the bolder they will be to pass progressive change.
Glad to see people here are reasonable and positive. While I'm a proud Bernie Bro, I'm glad to see others who are ready to join Team Biden are being received in such positive manner. Hope we'll all be one team again to fight the orange man...until then I'll enjoy the banter between us.   \#ByeByeTrump
So happy to have you here!  Welcome!
Welcome! As a Pete supporter, it's still a little bittersweet for me, but I feel like Biden has done an unusually good job of welcoming supporters from other campaigns while retaining that other campaign's identity.
Be sure to vote in the general election.
I'm a Pete person, so I totally understand how painful it is when you lose the one you really believe in. But Joe's campaign is a great place to be, and I'm glad you're here.
Hey, good for you for getting out to vote and being involved!  I don't think you wasted your time. The progressive movement is coming faster than most people think; just not as fast as some people want.  The real key to remember is that we need to take the senate and the house and keep them. If both Obama's and Trump's presidencies have taught me anything, it is that the president can be blocked at every opportunity or get nearly anything done depending on the makeup of congress.  Keep voting down ballot progressives, and we can all still make sure we get change.
Sanders may not have been able to build a coalition but his ideas are extremely compelling and it shows with the support he got. He may not end up being president but he'll be a strong voice in the party for a long time.
I’m a former Amy supporter.  I liked her ability to get work done plus tbh I grooved on those Marge Gunderson vibes. But now it’s time for the Avengers to assemble. Your superpowers are needed.
I'm hopeful that Biden and Bernie are going to see what they can do to engage Bernie fans in the (almost inevitable) event of a Biden win. Biden is recognising what drew people to Pete, Amy, Beto etc and he will do this for Bernie if they work together
>I can't help but feel stupid for believing that Bernie could do it, that he actually had a chance. Especially knowing that a lot of his moderate detractors have continuously pointed out how unrealistic he and his policies are, and his candidacy has unfortunately proved that more than anything. I was and am taking this especially hard because it's my first time voting, and I wanted to be a part of something historic.  You shouldn't feel stupid, the data clearly shows that Bernie's policies are realistic options, many countries have them in some form or another. If they are "unrealistic" it is only because the electorate has been convinced they are, not because there is any technical reason they could not be implemented. People's minds can change. If you and those like you believe in these policies and keep championing them, there is hope in the future. You can be part of something historic, it will just take longer and require more work than you had hoped. History is often slower than we would like.  As Bernie pointed out in his speech today, the exit polling data is a source for hope. The majority of voters in these primaries have supported M4A, and the youth overwhelmingly supported Sanders. There is a good chance that Sanders policies represent the future of the Democratic party, and if that is the future you want you will need to keep working to make that happen.  There is also hope with Biden. Obviously he would be an far better president than Trump, but he will also be open to influence from the left. Bernie's constituency is an important component of the Democratic base. Biden needs Sander's voters, and so will be amenable to pressure from them. It is possible to both support Biden against Trump, and pressure him to adopt more progressive policies. As Bernie's slogan states "not me. us." The electorate has the power to push politicians. The movement Bernie started need not end with is candidacy, and you should not abandon the policies which will make America a better place.
This is FOUR years old but read it, especially #4   [https://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/](https://michaelmoore.com/trumpwillwin/)
As a fellow Bernie bro, thanks for fighting along side us.
Bernie is still in the race, you can still vote for him and support Biden in the fall. Bernie has fought so hard for us. Stick with him for one more week. Obviously this will not be popular here. The fact is that only half the delegates have been awarded. Now that there are only two people left, we can finally get a robust discussion around policies, which could help improve Biden's positions a bit before the general.
I am in the same boat! I voted for Bernie in California in the 2016 and 2020 primaries. I am obviously heart broken that Bernie is losing. However, I have read Biden's policies and they are better than Trump's plans obviously and generally they are pretty good and better than what we have now. If Biden is the nominee (all but assured at this point), Joe can count on my vote.
Welcome, friend! I appreciate Sanders supporters like you that just want to improve our country. My main issue with Bernie has always been that he doesn’t have a realistic vision about how to get things done. But, I want healthcare for all of us and a better environmental policy and all of that stuff, just like most Bernie supporters. The difference between Joe and Bernie is that Joe has worked hard to build the kind of unity that actually gets stuff passed. I feel really optimistic about our chances at improving healthcare and our quality of life in the future with Joe Biden, and I hope you do too. We’re all in this together, and I’m happy to have you with us!
How did you get the Pete for joe flair?
I've looked at some of Joe's policies before and while I don't agree with everything in them, they are definitely fair and good policies which I find a lot of my own progressive values in, like you said. Especially his policies relating to school. Just some minor disagreements, didn't mean to imply otherwise in the OP. But I'll definitely brush up on some of the policies I've yet to learn about. Thanks for the comment : )

Yup warren supporter here, maybe "appeal to critical thinkers" is not the way to win an election in this country. Name recognition + demographics are. Biden has the support of the African American community, he does not have the decades of republican hate mongering that worked against Hillary. So far his numbers in the last few weeks bode well for the general.  On the other hand, Sander's numbers have been worse than they were 4 years ago. Maybe things would have turned out different if Bernie had backed Warren from day1 instead of them going in against each other. Who knows, even if Warren had started the primary with a Sanders endorsement (or vice versa) they still could not have broken their polling ceiling that seems to limit super-progressives.   And to be honest he played out the last month masterfully. not flinching even while 538 had him down, locking up the key endorsements to overperform in SC, getting the centrist candidates to fall in place behind him, overperforming again on super tuesday, then doing well yesterday (all while rather underfunded). His story of SC primary to nomination is going to be studied for a while. I can say I am impressed with the competence and execution of his campaign.    I consider myself very progressive and yet yesterday in Mississippi primary I gave my vote to Biden. It is over and the best thing to do is to end the primary season the sooner the better. Present a united party against donald's bad faith and hypocritical attacks.
I liked Warren a lot too! She was actually my preferred candidate for a while. I agree with you, we need to assemble and do what's best for America (and that's definitely not Trump for another 4 years lol).
I have looked at those plans before, though I definitely need to relook at his climate change plan honestly, as it is a fairly complex topic. I actually really like his school plan, personally, even if I stated that I have some differences with it. As someone who is going to community college right now and has found it a convenient way to get a cheaper education (I technically get it for free actually), it's great that other people will be able to get a similar opportunity to me! I didn't know that about the overseas prescription drug pricing, that's great! I'll refresh my memory on that.   Anyways, thanks for the nice comment : )
Duly noted. Thanks!
Saying same. This country is going to need every able body to get out and vote blue ! Period.
Thanks friend. You all have given me a new perspective. There are plenty of ideas that I think Biden and us can work together to bring to fruition. Looking forward to doing it with you all come November!
Thanks for the super kind comment. That is a great way to put it! Maybe some candidates aren't the best at delivering it, but hopefully their supporters can inspire further change. Here's to us bettering the country!
How did you get banned you dumbass?
Exactly. I hope when the primary ends, we will all come together on one team for the good of the nation. I for one will welcome you.
Yes, if Biden's advisors are smart, they will give an olive branch to Bernie supporters (like me) in one form or another with policy changes being my preferred form. Biden will need to unite all factions if he is the nominee. I have read Biden's policy proposals and made a determination that I prefer Biden over Trump but other Bernie supporters will require that olive branch.
Wow, he really nailed it.  Everything about that article was on point.
Go to the right (only on browser, and not on old reddit) and click on community options under the create a new post button.
I think his healthcare plan in particular gets a lot of undeserved flak and misrepresentation, considering it would have universal coverage for everyone and would be free to low income families and have a strict premium cap for everyone else that would put their premiums at on average half what they are now.
tbh we've gotten enough of these posts lately that I'm honestly 100% just copypasting it every time this sort of post comes up because it's been applicable literally every time
How is universal coverage on a free public plan "for profit"?
Yoooo do you know much about carbon taxes? That's my favorite part of biden's entire platform.
That also works in the reverse - call out anything *you see* that needs to be squashed, and the mods are great about taking care of it. Welcome! :)
😎😎😎Malarkey detected 😎 😎😎  😎Obvious troll 😎
Pretty sure it works on Old Reddit; I have an extension that auto switches to old and it let me have flair.
I think they took it down or its not working because I don't see anything under community options when i tried
Lol i noticed that’s why I said we should just stick it. But I appreciate the dedication!
[deleted]
I saw someone saying the option to change it didn't show up on old reddit, that's all I know.
138% of the poverty line isn't all that low, and above that level it's capped at 8.5% of your income, which for most families is roughly half what they're paying now.  That's not counting the caps on medication costs, the ban on "surprise billing", and the auto enrollment.  "No change" is straight up dishonest tbh.

I love that this sub has become a blend of the original r/JoeBiden supporters, r/neoliberal memes, reddit addicts from Pete's sub, Warren people looking around nervously, and a random smattering of r/politics refugees .   Can't say I saw this coming in May 2019, but it's just crazy enough that it might work.
Me in 2019 “I’ll never vote for Biden”. Fast forward to Pete dropping out, now me, “Uncle Joe, TAKE MY MONEY”. I started to give Biden a serious look when him and Pete seemed to be almost friendly at the debates. Joe’s words about Pete and Pete’s words about Uncle Joe have solidified by belief. I also took a hard look at Joe’s climate change policy, while not as aggressive as I would like, Its more then I gave him credit for a few months ago.

Joe on his heels can be cringey sometimes, but Joe with the wind at his back is a badass.     I'm similar to you in that I NEVER thought Biden was who I'd find myself supporting after fervently being in the Pete camp, but here we are and it for some reason doesn't feel strange at all.     I think it helps a lot that Joe seems to actually recognize in Pete what all of us did, and expresses this recognition authentically. He's not just patting him on the head and saying thanks for the votes, he actually wants to empower Pete for the future.
You new to Reddit?  Welcome!  Dumb memes are what we do.    Seriously, I’ve had to learn not to over analyze memes. It’s the top level thought that counts.
this meme is not about slavery. roman empire memes are pretty common on reddit and have nothing to do with that.
It's a picture.  One is in disarray, one is organized.  It's not about slaves.

Stop brigading. It's possible to be a moderate without kowtowing to some supposed "oligarchs." Some of us legitimately believe that pragmatic and moderate policies are better.
Last time I checked Trump and his cronies have been pushing hard against everyone *but* Bernie in the nomination process.
I don't agree with a lot of the concensus in /r/neoliberal such their ambivalence to the concentration of economic wealth, privatisation of natural monopolies, advocacy of open borders without consideration of infrastructure and service provision or their hagiography of Margerat Thatcher.  However, I can post these criticisms in /r/neoliberal (and I have) without harassment or being downvoted into oblivion.  I can't say the same of the Purity-Left on reddit or real life.
Here's a sneak peek of /r/neoliberal using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!  \#1: [Honestly, used to be brainwashed into the Bernie Stan till I found this sub.

It's thunder dome over there. I can barely stand to even peek in now and then.
for good reason
I don't care for ~~hate~~ subs based primarily on negative and cynical criticism, even if I occasionally agree with the criticisms they level.
Haha, I only said it because it's true of myself as well.
Be mad
Yeah, Trump is basically defending/supporting Bernie in a lot of his tweets about the dem primaries. He really wants Bernie as his opponent
That's the thing, there are things I disagree with them on as well (many the same things you list) and there's no way I would ever get nostalgic about someone like Thatcher, Romney or Reagan, but the fact that they welcome the discussion and can speak intelligently about their stances and rationale is just so refreshing compared to the political cesspools found elsewhere on this site.   Plus they have dope ass memes which are missing from places like r/politicaldiscussion
It's not a hate sub, it's morphed into basically a r/politics for people not in the cult. I've had nice conversations on policy with Kamala people, with liz people even
Don't waste your energy on that one. 30 seconds in his comment history gave me the heebie jeebies.
*hate* was probably the wrong word for me to use.  It's a sub based around being critical of someone, not of promoting positive alternatives (even if that occasionally happens).  Maybe I'm a bit paranoid about it, but discourse across Reddit tends to have a trend of overly cynical and critical subreddits spiraling out of control and becoming more focused on "owning the (insert other here)" instead of being more positive and productive.  The negativity is toxic and just feels unhealthy.     If you're able to enjoy yourself there, however, please don't let me try to dissuade you.  To each their own!
A specter is haunting r/JoeBiden
No worries!
A little throwback to when President Obama surprised Joe with the Presidential Medal of Freedom
It sickens me that Trump tarnished this honor by giving it to Rush Limbaugh.
Aaaaaand I’m crying
his face when Obama says "to award our highest honor" and he realizes what the fuck he's talking about tho
I like that Joe's replies were to congradulate and venerate Barack Obama instead of himself..     Joe was just handed one of the most greatest honor as an American citizen and he proceeds to tell everyone in the room how great the other guy is..      I love his honesty... he stumbles a lot when he speaks....... but I love his honesty and genuineness.
Verklempt!
He should wear it sometimes.
Thank you!  I hadn’t seen that before!
One of my all-time favorite moments. Joe had no idea it was coming and he understood the honor.
This should be a campaign ad on its own. His reaction is so genuine. It's moving. He loves his country and has the best of intentions.
Aaaaand I'm crying. 😭😭😭
Tears. Every time. 😭🥰
Trump has tarnished everything, and it will be interesting to see how we can rebound from that.
Trump will be tossing these things out like paper towel at a hurricane disaster site, just to fluff his ego.

Nate Silver is retiring the Primary Forecast model. Diamond Joe Robinette Biden Jr is now, essentially, the “presumptive” Democratic nominee for President of the United States 💎🇺🇸💎
🐊💎💎🐊 THE MODEL IS NOW OBSOLETE 🐊💎💎🐊
So we won't track whether Sanders chance are 1/100, 1/1,000, or 1/1,000,000? Sounds like a DNC ploy to hide that Bernie is actually winning.
💎☕️
About time!
Let’s not be snarky. Sanders and Biden both want the same things, just in different ways. I really hope we can make Sanders supporters feel as welcome here as possible.
I'll believe it when Bernie drops out.
I was surprised by Bernies message of support for Biden if(when) he gets the nom in the debate. But jeez his supporters do *not* seem to be on the same page if reddit is remotely an indication. Really curious how this will pan out
LOL sanders is the one who sabotaged hillary in 2016 by staying in 2 months after she became the presumptive nominee. This guy is a large part of the reason Hillary lost and why we have Trump. I have zero respect for him and his online supporters. The irl ones are fine though.
Reddit is never an indication. Youd have no idea Bernies true support nationwide is like 10-15% by looking at reddit.

As a Warren supporter and someone who was at her rally in LA just 3 days ago, I am saddened by her campaign’s end. I’m a pragmatic progressive and Obama was the first President I had the privilege of campaigning for. I’m happy to say that I will be giving my time and money to support Biden!
Former Warren and Buttigieg supporter here.  Remember Obama/Biden embraced the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that Liz championed
Welcome to the JOEalition!
Welcome! I'm still trying to process Pete dropping.
Warren was the right progessive candidate not bernie. But joe will get those ideas and values to life.  Welcome aboard!.
Pragmatic progressive.  I like that.
Welcome, we are glad you are here!
Glad you joined us!
I'm going to miss Warren but I'm so glad she ran. To paraphrase Yang from a couple days ago: Elizabeth Warren deserved much more than she got this primary.
As a former Beto supporter welcome. The thing I like about Joe is he wants you to keep on loving Liz. You're in the right place.
I honestly don't see more than half of warren's support going to bernie.  which makes it at most a wash, if not a benefit to biden.  What was your sense as a supporter?
Welcome.:)
As someone who's been a Warren fan since her senate race back in '12. I did support her for a hot second during this race and would have happily campaigned supproted her had she done better. And as a fellow pragmatic progressive I wanna welcome you on board the Biden Bus!
Welcome! Warren was high on my list, too. If we flip the senate, she should be top of the list for majority leader. Her being able to tell McConnell to shut up would be delicious.
I started with Warren about a year ago. She had the best plan I’ve heard from any candidate to address housing, but Joe is the best on foreign policy which is #1 to me right now. Joe is gonna get this country back on track. Warren would make a hell of a VP, otherwise she should stay in the Senate to maintain majorities.
I’m voting for Joe Biden for senate also!
[removed]
Pete was my number two with Biden a close third. Her work in that Bureau is what made me want her to run for President. She puts ideas to action unlike a certain cranky old yeller who is too stubborn to just end his campaign to unify the party, which would drastically improve our chances of beating Trump by showing a unified front.
I just came over from the Warren camp, too. Welcome!
Me too. Just joined this sub today so that progress right? Haha
Pete is a great pragmatic progressive as well. I hope he becomes VP.
I just call myself an obama democrat.  But I think that's what it is
I actually think Warren’s end of her campaign is going to be a net benefit to Biden. From the people I met in person through volunteer work and online via secret Facebook groups for her, it’s a higher educated base than Bernie. Most people I know who support her are pragmatic progressives and hated what Bernie was doing to give the progressive agenda a bad reputation through his negativity, lack of unifying message, lack of detailed plans, abrasive attitude towards questioning, bashing of legitimate news reporting, and a cult of personality that is continually encouraged. There’s actually a lot of Hillary supporters who became Warren supporters. If you look at the statistics of who is supporting Bernie it’s actually a completely different demographic than Warren supporters. Warren supporters are much more aligned with Biden’s base. Even if Warren endorses Bernie, I don’t think a lot of her base will go to Bernie as most of us saw through the cult of personality and lack of ability to actually lead his own staff let alone his supporters.
I'm a former Warren supporter, and I think the people who would have gone to Bernie already left her last fall after she started slipping in the polls because of being honest about her multi-step M4A roll out (as if Bernie would magically bypass congress and get it done day one..). I think those who remain are the pragmatic ones like OP who will largely go to Biden.
Not OP, but another warren supporter. I switched to Bernie for a few days just because I thought he was the logical 2nd choice.... but I didnt feel it. What I liked most about warren aside from being a bold progressive and fierce fighter for the working class and less fortunate is her pragmatism. She fights the smart fight, she builds alliances and coalitions, and she has clout as someone who is respectable and gets shit done. Bernies heart was always in the right place, but his senate record is lacking. He gives good speeches and makes protest votes, and he certainly has a place in the debate, but I just dont see him as someone who can unilaterally push his massive expensive radical agenda through a congress with many Republicans and many moderates. Joe isn't as progressive as I'd like, and he has had bad votes and picked the wrong side in fights, but hes still progress, he will reverse trump and cement Obama's legacy for another decade, and I believe that he can rally progressives, moderates, and maybe a few moderate republicans to his side.
I voted for Warren on Tuesday after being a big-time Pete supporter, and a very large number of my friends IRL voted for Warren. My sense is that a lot of them are not necessarily excited about Joe, but their dislike for Bernie is STRONG. I agree it's generally a more educated and policy-wonk-loving demographic than Bernie's, LOL.  (this describes me too, but I'm starting to get excited about Joe 😊)
[deleted]
Liz is fantastic.  She experienced the hate coming from Bernie’s camp, which was disgusting towards Pete.  And it’s sad because she and her supporters treated Bernie with such respect.  For me, even if I absolutely agreed in every way with Bernie,  I still do not want our country to continue on an angry and hateful path.  Time to heal
For sure! One thing I like about the Biden OGs is that they like adopting some of our subs culture, like the ROTR were adopted. And I will warn you now, certain supporters really test the discipline aspect of it 😭
Another Warren-to-Biden here. I think you're right, there are a lot of us.
Thanks for confirming my suspicions
[removed]
Yeah, I think it speaks well of Uncle Joe's leadership that supporters of other candidates are being welcomed not just for their votes and volunteer work, but also for their ideas.   He's also sharing credit for the work, which speaks to a real team mentality, which should be required of any candidate of this age!
Yes it does. You get more focused on the process of enunciation rather than the content.
Also the distinct advantage of creating paraphernalia that allows us to continue who we originally supported. The amount of Pete and Joe stuff I have seen is amazing, there's stuff for Amy and Beto!   Its reassuring and It motivates me to help Uncle Joe in any ways I can!
Joe Biden on Twitter: My running mate will be a woman.
Senator Tammy Duckworth would be a great choice!
 Hmm, I wonder who. Klobuchar, Kamala, Warren, someone completely out of left field?
Amazing! So thrilled!
won't lie, I wanted Pete. But I feel like he's assured an important cabinet position anyway which is a big step up from mayor of South Bend and will put him on a good trajectory.
Great move. Not many things will get coverage while coronavirus is happening, but this will
Pleased with this!!
Someone we already know like Harris? Or someone out of left field like Tammy Duckworth?
[deleted]
[removed]
If he chooses Klob, please someone tell her to stop with that fucking hair joke she says constantly   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEJGBRbUFHA
I love andrew yang's tweet when he heard this "he didnt say this in any of our conversations" it's obviously a joke by yang but its funny
Well, there go my High Hopes :(  Maybe we'll get a SecState Pete?
Great news.  Abrams or Harris for VP. I would like to see Harris as AG. To see the look on Trump and Barr’s face when Harris announces investigations into the Trump administration would be gold.
My bet is it will be Klobuchar. Super productive Senator with a lot of experience and appeal in the rust belt which will be central to the campaign. I actually thought she was the most likely VP pick before he made this announcement.  If not Klobuchar, next most likely is probably Harris.
I told you so.
My bet is Stacey Abrams
Stacy Abrams. Stacy Abrams. Stacy Abrams.  Stacy Abrams. Stacy Abrams.
The ideal VP for this moment would be Latina, early 40's, from a Western state, with 10 years in political office-- but not Congress-- like if Sotomayor were 20 years younger and a Governor. I dont think there is such a person-- but I applaud his announcement to pick a woman. There are so many that will make a great VP, & POTUS 2024.
I’d be fine with Klobuchar, or Harris. I think Warren will either stay in the senate or be put in the Cabinet.
Harris Please...
I love Kamala Harris, but he also mentioned that he would be putting an African American woman on the Supreme Court.   My best guess is it will be Klobuchar on the ticket, and Harris as the court nominee.
How did he tweet this in the middle of the debate?   I mean, I know he doesn't actually write or send any of the tweets attributed to his account, but I at least like to pretend. This really ruins the suspension of disbelief when I'm actually looking at him live on camera while "Joe Biden" is posting this to twitter.
hey joe, you have my vote, now do me a solid, ADOPT MEDICARE FOR ALL!!
Everyone keeps saying Harris or Abrams but why not elect a VP that will help you flip the swing states? I feel like that should be one of the most important considerations and I don’t know how a representative from California or Georgia will help flip midwest states.
He chooses AOC and he's done. That being said, I think it's gonna be Kamala Harris.
I have to agree. Hopefully Joe choses her, but some people might think she's still too green? I think she's great for women, for veterans, and for immigrants.
As someone who lives two blocks outside her former district (unfortunately my rep is far more milquetoast), and is now represented by her in the Senate, I completely agree.  Total class, great experience.
Dont you go threatening me with a good time now!
The names frequently mentioned in addition to those are Tammy Duckworth, Stacey Abrams, Tammy Baldwin, and Gretchen Whitmer. There are really a lot of great options.
Hopefully someone out of the field, and with a lot of political experience.
Please Tammy please.  Edit: Duckworth
[deleted]
Warren is a no, the VP needs to be relatively young and there's only a 7 year difference between them. I predict left field, though I have a worry that it might be Harris for demographic/political expediency reasons. My main reason for thinking it won't be is that I think that would be a poor decision and I think Biden doesn't make too many decisions I consider poor.
Abrams
The betting markets are pretty evenly split between kamala and klobuchar at like 1/3 chance each. Everyone else is less likely
JANET NAPOLITANO. 62. former Az governor.   Also Val Demmings 63 Fla Congresswoman.
The dream ticket would be Biden/Clinton, but that's probably not going to happen. I wouldn't mind if he chose either Warren or Kamala to be his VP.
IMO Klobuchar as VP(59, well loved in the mid-west, slam dunk for the election), Kamala Harris as Attorney General, Warren stays in congress
Michelle Obama  /s
Warren... bringing the progressives along
As a gay who has been to countless bachelorette parties, and never been to a single bachelor party... I think we still count as female for most people, lol.  Kidding, but I still wanna keep the dream alive!
We should be so lucky to have Tammy Duckworth on the ticket!
Pete will have a place on his cabinet if Buden wants it to be truly representative of the US, we need some more LGBTQ higher ups in the White House.  If anything happened to Biden before the general, i.e. Covid-19, I’d imagine Pete would be on the short list of people Biden would like to take his place at the top of the ticket.
Yeah, I feel you. It pretty much crushed my will to care about politics
It's not like there's a shortage of qualified women to choose from. What skills or abilities do you think are being sacrificed with this decision?
Oh god, why did I watch that entire video?
I’m thinking Sec Defense
He’s been talked about a lot for UN Ambassador. That would seem like a great starting point, high profile, but not like Secretary of State which requires someone with way more experience in foreign affairs.  I like Pete too, I think he has a very long and promising career in politics ahead of him.
Sally Yates for AG.  And the next AG shouldn't be involved in any investigation of Trump, that should be done by a special counsel that is 100% independent.
Amy is a great choice...on paper. She is from Minnesota, a purple state that could swing to Trump in the upcoming election. This could help Biden's chances at keeping the state. She is also popular in the industrial mid west, in must win states like Michigan and Wisconsin. She also has appeal with folks in the suburbs, Biden's primary campaign target.   Her only downfall is her lack of favorabikity. For whatever reason, research shows people don't like her very much, and that is an issue (at least a little)   https://www86.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/amy_klobuchar_favorableunfavorable-6767.html
I want her to run for governor again in 2022
Catherine Cortez Masto from Nevada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Cortez_Masto) meets a lot of your suggestions.  Eight years as Attorney General of Nevada and three years as a Senator.
Her record as AG turned out to be very controversial, and she ended up being a much weaker candidate in debates than people were expecting. She's also from California (not a swing state by any means), and Biden already has great black outreach without her, so I think she's a pretty weak choice overall.
After she called him a racist? No thanks!
Hell no
That’d be a weird as hell ticket.   I think it’s gonna be Obama’s former AG.
He may occasionally write his own tweets though not in the context of scrolling through Twitter spontaneously deciding to tweet. Hillary used to sign hers with -H when they were from her not her team.
I’m guessing he’s got a social media team.  This is not a president who tweets during his morning pish on his golden toilet.
To be fair, Abrams only lost her gubernatorial run by a couple thousand votes. Clinton only list the state by 5%. Abrams might bring Georgia into play.
If we can increase turnout in GA though, that puts 2 Senate seats potentially in play (especially the jungle primary one). I bet it'd help in states like NC too. That's important.
AOC is too young. She won't be eligible for about another 5 years.
She’s been a senator about as long as Obama was before he was elected.  And she was in the House a few years before that.  If we keep letting Baby Boomers say that Gen X and Millennials are too green, they will never pass the torch to us.
With her birth in Thailand is Duckworth able to become president? I am not sure what Stacey Abrams gets Joe. She is awesome, but she might help the Dems more with her work to end voter suppression. Baldwin & Whitmer are contenders.
Someone younger would also be a smart move.  We need to start getting a spotlight on rising stars in the party for future election cycles.
Gretchen Whitmer - Gov of Michigan
Biden, Pelosi 2020.   What could possibly go wrong
so long as it's not someone who quits politics because they can't handle it what so ever.
Shouldn't it be someone with little experience? To cultivate younger generation?
Either Tammy would be great, honestly.
Massachusetts holds special elections. Warren's replacement would in all likelihood be another Dem.
Each of them brings something different to the table.  Kamala would be history making as not only the first female VP but the first female POC VP, but being from CA doesn't really help in terms of electoral advantage (if CA is ever in play the problems are way bigger than a running mate status can change).  Klobuchar would help with the midwest, but doesn't do much to help ease Bernie supporters into the ticket.
Val Demings is my top choice
Klobuchar is dull and uninspiring though, and hasn't proved to be very good at campaigning (her childish meltdown during the previous debate was .... not a good sign)... Joe should not repeat Hillary's Tim Kaine mistake.  Abrams seems a vastly better choice. She *is* inspiring.
It's not a movie casting or fantasy football draft, you don't just choose the prominent celebs for image or cheerleading related reasons.
Agree. Obviously I’m biased towards Amy though. Biden is progressive, so I think someone more moderate might make moderate democrats and republicans more comfortable. I like Tammy Duckworth too. Kamala would kick ass as AG.
too important in congress
No. An ideologically split ticket is a bad idea, especially with a president as old as Biden who's unofficially floated only serving one term.  Progressives won't win this election. Klob or someone like her is the best bet for going after the voters who gave the House back to the Democrats.  The crazy minority of Bernie Bros who might vote third party or Trump if they don't get their way won't be won over by Warren or some other progressive on the ticket.  But a progressive firebrand on the ticket could scare away the purple state independents who created the blue wave of '18.
I think it would be a smart move. She's a woman, a mom, a vet, from a military AND immigrant family...it would be a smart choice to get both sides to vote for you.
Not saying there is. But there are also men who are qualified.
We can agree to disagree but Trump and his cronies should be held accountable for the unprecedented corruption of this administration.
She’s a fantastic senator, and I loved how far she got in the primaries.  But... she’s so vanilla.  Boring.  Joe needs someone young and exciting like Obama needed him to bring calm experience and maturity to his ticket.
Most of these show a tie, about as many people like her as don’t. From what I understand Biden has a similar favorability rating, just with way less people with no opinion.
Maybe it's because of her reputation of being mean to staff? While she's competent, if the staff thing is true, that's not someone we should have potentially leading this country.
Never heard of her-- just drilled down a bit-- I think she could be perfect! Great resume,  Harris can be killer AG, Warren or Klobuchar replacing Moscow Mitch-- the Cabinet will be impressive as hell!
Perdue is gonna be tough to unseat, but Loeffler (or whoever wins the primary) is one that could be picked up.
Gen Mattis was only 4 of the 7 required years out of service, Congress just changed the law to let him in anyways. That's how it works at the top
Agreed. They said the same about Kennedy and Obama being too green. I think she'd be ideal, but more and more ppl are sayin it'll be Harris.
> With her birth in Thailand is Duckworth able to become president?   Yes, [Tammy Duckworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth#Early_life_and_education) is a natural born citizen despite having been born in Thailand because her father was a U.S. Citizen.
I think one of Duckworth's parents (her dad I believe) was an American citizen so she would qualify for being able to run for president that way I think. It's the same deal why Ted Cruz was able to run in 2016. His mom was born in the US even though his dad is Cuban, so that is why he could run even though he was born in Canada.
 Stacy Abrams. Stacy Abrams. Stacy Abrams. Stacy Abrams.
[removed]
Nope, she's far too important where she's at right now
Haven’t heard of her, but if she’s popular in MI that’s a smart move to help numbers in that state.
This is the one.
Ohh, hell no.  They’ll come after Pelosi harder than they came after HRC.  We need her in the House anyway.
Joe needs someone who'd be able to do the job of President right from day 1. He's old, and would be the oldest president ever by several years. While he seems to be in great health, I think having a very experienced VP who's 20+ years younger than him would calm the minds of lots of folks inclined to vote for him but scared of an inexperienced VP taking over in the worst case.
For sure. I haven't followed Baldwin as much as I have Duckworth, but everything I've seen so far is great.
You are correct. I incorrectly assumed the governor would appoint her replacement in the interim, but the office would remain vacant until the special election.  Edit: I was actually correct the first time. The gov would appoint her replacement in the interim.
I would love to see Harris tear Pence to shreds in a debate.   Also, if Joe is the nominee I hope he has the sense to pick a running mate who helps unite the party and inspire voter turnout. My ideal pick would be Warren; Klobuchar would be a dud.
One nice thing about her being from CA is that her senate seat would be safe
JOE BIDEN HAS WON TEXAS!
The BETO BUMP
Hahahaha. This is amazing.  Greatest chicken joint in Texas.
Gonna eat some Whataurger tomorrow in celebration
This is incredible. I can't believe we pulled it off. Joe never polled that high, *even at his peak*. For him to come back like this after being so far behind in the early vote...damn. People *really* hit the polls for Joe yesterday.
Yeehaw
Such a great thing to wake up to!
The O'Rourke rise!
*glares angrily in Texan*
How can you say that when both layne's and cane's  exist?
Truly, Beto was the table on which Biden stood
*Laughs in Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit*  I am Texan, love Whataburger, and was triggered like a *motherfucker* when I first saw that tweet.
I saw that too lol. I'm hoping someone was intentionally trolling us because I couldn't figure out otherwise how someone could be that dumb.
Don’t forget the Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich!!!
They were referring to the chicken joint he went to earlier in the day. They just screwed up by showing the pic of him at Whataburger.
Florida alone will effectively wipe out all other Bernie states
The longer Bernie stays in the more his supporters hatred of Biden fester and the greater chance Trump gets re-elected.  Imagine voting for Trump just because you hate Biden.
Bernie needs to drop out TONIGHT. If he doesn't, the media, Joe, and the general public need to give him the same attention we give Tulsi Gabbard which is next to nothing.
Statements like these are what we need to be on r/all, politics, s4p, etc. These types of statements will make them realize we need to come together.
Is FL a winner-take-all state? Or is it just really that large?
I don't see much hate for Biden, just weak attacks that fall flat like he's not very smart and then he wins  a 1 on 1 debate.
 a lot of people are ignoring bernie at this point. biden can still win the general without bernies supporters. For example he can convince republican moderates to vote for him
This is crazy that it's happening to Biden. This happened to Hillary and I somewhat understood it, the way the media portrayed her made her seem somewhat shady or untrustworthy, but Biden is such a better candidate much more electable. Bernie people need to start realizing it's just not possible, he's losing even worse than last time because the candidate running against him is much better than before.
\>  Imagine voting for Trump just because you hate Biden.   &#x200B;  Sounds just as stupid as voting for Trump just because you hate Hillary Clinton. It's a good thing no one was stupid enough to do that
Set the delegate threshold needed for the next debate so it’s only Joe on stage.
Holy shit, is Tulsaad Garbàge *still* in and hasn't officially dropped out yet?
thata'd only make them angrier. look at Bernie's subreddit - they already have a response to his loss and it is basically that the election process was meddled with. Taking the loss just as well as in 2016.
It's that large and Biden got it by such a huge margin. AP is showing 130 delegates to Biden and 48 to Bernie at this point. (there's still some final counts so that total should change slightly)
There are no winner-take-all states in the Democratic primary, that's a Republican thing.
Check out the Bernie subreddits. Plenty of hate for Biden over there. Along with hate for everyone who isn’t a Bernie supporter.
Lol I keep getting people on twitter that tell me that Biden and Trump are the same policy wise. I hope they are either trolls or a huge minority of voters because those people are crazy.
Sanders surrogates cannot effectively weaponize misogyny again like  in 2016.
He already is converting republican moderates.  Many have said they would consider voting for Biden but never vote for Sanders.
That wasn't the reason she lost.  She lost because she didn't campaign at all in the rust belt.  She felt that blue wall was going to hold no matter what.
Are there gonna be anymore debates? I thought they were finished now.
She's in Russia's pockets. Hillary correctly called that months ago.
How exciting!
It's also how the electoral college functions in states other than Maine and Nebraska.
I'm sure if we look hard enough we can find it. I just mean in general I don't think Joe is going to have the "likability" problem that Hillary had. And let's be honest: it wasn't likeability. It was misogyny and sexism. Joe being a man will shield him from that.
I didn't say it was. She made mistakes in the campaign strategy. It doesn't make voting for Trump only because of propaganda-fueled hatred towards Hillary a tiny bit less dumb.
Hindsight is 2020. She was never trailing in a poll in Wisconsin. She campaigned heavily in Pennsylvania.
I’d watch 90 minutes of him eating ice cream with mirrored shades, just for quarantine fun!
I think after mid-March they don't plan them in advance anymore and decide on it as the race goes on. You don't see very many presidential primaries that go on for this long.
No need to look hard at all. It’s frequent and open.   I agree with you re Joe’s lack of likability problems.
You are definitely misguided. The reason Hillary lost in 2016 wasn't sexism, but a weak campaign, identity politics("I am going to be the first woman president") and not taking their competition seriously.  Obama won because of his energy and faith in the nation. Republicans didn't have any strong candidate, so they picked the most boring one and lost.
Oh for sure.  Anyone that votes for Trump is an enemy to this country, period.
Ok thanks!
Wasn’t ONLY because of sexism  Sexism played a factor.
30 years of being attacked didn't help. A lot of Dems didn't vote for her because they thought she was evil because they had been told she was for so long. Biden doesn't have that problem and will pull Republicans that don't like Trump but would never vote for Hillary
That is correct, however what is the most astonishing thing is that whereas traditional conservatives   voted for someone who was and still is strongly supporting their own agenda, some people proudly voted for Trump while calling themselves progressives. That is something thats actually far dumber than voting for Trump because you're a conservative and he will do what you want for the country - thats voting against what you believe in, just because your favorite lost and someone you personally dislike got the nomination. Would Hillary have won if they voted for her? Theres no way of knowing that, but its despicable nonetheless.
I will have to be disagree. She had a very unlikeable personality and always behaved as if everyone was her inferior. And like you said, a lot of people considered her malicious, whether it was misguided or not we'll probably never know.  However, biden doesn't really have these problems, like you pointed out. His umbrella policy is going to unite every anti-trump voter, republican and democratic alike.  My only concern is whether or not Sanders' supporters will also support him in the general election when Sanders inevitably loses the primary election. This may sting if they won't bother to vote.
What is that saying?  Cutting off your nose to spite your face.
I think they have proved that Bernie's movement isn't as big as they thought they were. The ones that choose to not vote for Biden probably won't make a difference.
\>  She had a very unlikeable personality and always behaved as if everyone was her inferior.  &#x200B;  Example?  \> And like you said, a lot of people considered her malicious, whether it was misguided or not we'll probably never know.  &#x200B;  We knew before the election happened. Her charity work, her amazing contributions as FLOTUS (playing a major role in introducing pieces of legislation such as the [State Children's Health Insurance Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program), the [Adoption and Safe Families Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_and_Safe_Families_Act) and the [Foster Care Independence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_Care_Independence_Act)  )... To the contrary, what proof did we ever have to say that she is "malicious"? E-mails? That only came up later. What did she ever do that was PROVEN and not gossip that would indicate she was "malicious"? The entire notion was in fact the continuation of relentless Republican propagada from the 90s targetted at Bill Clinton and everything that surrounded him. It was picked up by people on our own side and in fact, they have perfected this "art" better than Republicans, with even more energy and resolve.  &#x200B;  Sorry if my message comes out as hostile, it's not - i understand if you just dislike Hillary,  i mean everyone can dislike anyone for whatever reason. But the word "malicious" brought my attention. I do agree with the rest of your message entirely.
I don't dislike her as a political figure. I dislike her as a person because her attitude was overbearing, at least this was the sentiment that most people(here on reddit) had during the 2016 primaries. You only have to go check the r/politics threads during early 2016.  It is undeniable that electing her as President would have been the better option(and with this 2019-ncov outbreak, it could have even saved lives), but it's not me who has to be convinced about this, ut's you guys in the US. I am just a foreigner watching your politics from a distance.  To adress the point about her being malicious, you only have to look at the republican **and** democratic media. In my very first comment, I said that she didn't have a very strong campaign and this is still true. She was so sure of winning against a dumbass businessman that she didn't really put in the effort, nor the DNC for that matter. The media built this malicious persona for her that caught on really well, **much, much better** than it would have for past candidates. I was not aware of her charity work and contributions, I would have assumed it was Bill's doing. Thank you for bringing it up.  I guess you can say that you've even changed my mind a about her but the fact is that Biden needs the support of Bernie's voters, otherwise without a united DNC, this will just be a repeat of 2016, narrowingly missing the election in some swing states.
Sure, i will never understand that because for me she was always so likeable but thats not something that can be debated, if you just didnt like her personality i can't argue against that, its far too subjective.   I agree, the media built this persona, maybe she didnt do a strong enough counter-initiative to that but that was actually my point - propaganda was being used against her by media of both parties. And i think it caught on so well because her last name is Clinton.   She joined Bill in working on it after she retired from being Secretary of State. Before that Chelsea Clinton also played her part. Hillary's tenure as a Secretary of State is also worth bringing up - i recommend reading into what this job looks like. Everyone understands POTUS has enormous responsibility, very often receives little grattitude and risks his life. Well, the same is true for this position. Why am i talking about it? Because the running theme is that Hillary is in politics for money and power, and if that was true she would have remained in the Senate instead of taking up one of the most difficult jobs there are in the country.   I hope i did change your mind and the minds of people who read these messages at least a bit. I agree entirely with your last point, Biden needs their help and thats why he had already asked for it, lets hope they answer his call.
USA Today Political Cartoon - Biden
That cartoon makes him look out of shape. In reality he looks fit af!
 Joe has got some cake on him, goddamn.
“I’m not dead, I’m not gonna die!”
This is really spot on.
FALSE!  The media is after Bernie!

"YEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH...."
Finally
Don't say that to his face.  He'd challenge you to a pushup contest.
Wrong!
Haha that would be awesome
OK.

Two men, so awesome they are!
Way to go Pete, go get that idiot Sanders Joe !!
Ooohhh I can just feel the Joe/Pete memes a'comin.   And possibly some bad fanfiction written by teen girls.
Secretary of State, please make Pete Secretary of State.
I didn't realize till today how much I enjoy this duo! Not that I think Pete should be VP (mainly because I think it would be good to pick a woman running mate), but nice to see such comradere and respect in an otherwise combative process.
Let's be civil towards Sanders.  We need his support and his supporters' if we win.
~~r/bidenbro~~   r/petepal
Rotr intensifies :)
Biden leads Sanders by ten points in enthusiasm among his supporters.
It's showing up in the polls!!! Positive hard data that we can take to the bank!
Pretty impressive
The reply by ‘can’t even’ I believe, in that Twitter thread, is imo, absolutely correct. Truly don’t even know why there is going to be a debate tonight.
The crazy thing is that these numbers match pretty closely to March 2019. Its almost as if the debates and early states are all just noise.
You're gosh darn right I'm enthusiastic about the man who's gonna be the most progressive American president ever
NO MORE MALARKEY! I WILL NEVER TIRE OF SAYING THAT! YOU CAN TELL I AM ENTHUSED BY MY USE OF CAPS LOCK!
Oof
I mean, given the recent weeks, its only natural.
Supporters of the leading candidate are more enthusiastic than the supporters of the runner up? Colour me surprised...
Can I get an explanation of this metric and how it's used for predictions?
the race would absolutely never be declared over if bernie had this kind of lead over biden
That's what happens when people have known you for decades.
It seems like the electorate was terrified to take a chance on a new face this year, so the two best known candidates ended up being the final two. Usually the debates and early states do matter.
One analyst said it's easy to win back voters who supported you in the first place.  So voters started by supporting Biden, looked around at the other "moderate" choices, but when all those choices disappeared, came back home to Biden.  They always liked him, they just thought about other people in the meantime.
Seems like Bernie is giving Biden a chance to win his wholehearted endorsement. In 2016 it was obvious that Bernie’s endorsement of Clinton was superficial, so he wants to avoid having his supporters go rogue again.
Who also has the experience to repair our foreign policy and to handle a national crisis like the one we're currently going through.
It’s not being declared over this poll about enthusiasm, it’s over because of the insurmountable lead that Biden has gotten. Sorry bud, but unless Biden drops dead there’s no mathematical way for Bernie to win.
https://gyazo.com/5ef77a77fde72bea0825bad6cb9cd1db  Do you think if Sanders and Biden had been swapped here that the race would be declared over?
If the polls in the rest of the states showed Bernie winning, yes. It would be over for Biden. Stop with the whole tin foil hat conspiracies.  What you don’t understand is to make up the difference in delegates, Bernie needs to not only win more states, but win big in at least a few. No polls show him winning any states, let alone in a large margin. There’s multiple states coming up where Sanders might not even pick up a single delegate, such as Florida which has 248 delegates. Bernie can’t make up for these kinds of losses. The same would be true for Biden if everything were in the complete reverse.
Unknowable because the delegates aren't the only and/or best metric. They count for the convention for sure but they don't measure the way things are going
Based on polling Biden should've dropped out and endorsed Warren in the summer.
No? Based on polling odds for majority, Bernie only ever went above "no one" once, and for less than a week. He was at a bit under 40% chance to get majority on 538, where his chances of winning now are under 0.1%.
Dude...polling from 6 months before anyone votes is literally meaningless. Bernie cannot make up the difference, accept it. If you feel that you’re right come back to this comment in a few weeks and we’ll see where he’s at.
I didnt say bernie would win. I said it was nonsensical to claim there should be no debate based on a discrepancy in polling and not actual votes.  Why are you so afraid of a debate anyway? Maybe you shouldn't support the mush brain guy just because Pete told you to for a cabinet position.
I didn’t say there shouldn’t be a debate. And it’s hilarious if you think Biden’s got a mush brain yet he beat Bernie in the debate....guess Bernie can’t even beat a guy with a mush brain :/  Also I support Biden not because Pete endorsed him. I was a huge Bernie supporter in 2016 but woke the fuck up. Can’t stand the guy now.
>I didn’t say there shouldn’t be a debate  Then why did you reply to me in this thread disagreeing with someone saying that there shouldn't be a debate?   >yet he beat Bernie in the debate  Being caught in multiple lies is winning a debate in the same universe Biden is a good candidate  >I was a huge Bernie supporter in 2016 but woke the fuck up.  I was a Clinton supporter, and I got tired of having to defend someone so obviously awful for ideological reasons. Sound familiar?

GET OUT THERE AND VOTE FOR JOE!
The memes round here are getting good. Are there some yangangers hanging out now?
Hello there, tip toeing in to see how the Biden vibe is , I was on Team Pete and it was pure joy, hope to find some fun campaigning here too !!
Just me and the boys* winning the 2020 election
And warren is out there being an idiot
Lol.
You do realize these are villains?
uh.....dude on the left straight up admitted he wants to take our guns away.
This is cringy.
I'm an old, but I've been terminally online forever. You learn to adapt to the new meme styles.
Nah us younger Biden supporters are holding it down
Meh, I love her too much for her jabs at Bloomberg.  She's also a better version of Bernie. She's about as much to the left as him, but has managed to get more done in 10 years then Bernie in 30. And she doesn't seem to have a BernieBro problem.
Maybe the caption's an essential part of some meme I don't know....but Amy isn't a boy.
Its a common meme. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/me-and-the-boys

She could be one of da bois though.
How a man treats his peers says a lot about him. Two candidates respond to Pete dropping out, only one makes it about himself.

I'm with Biden now!
I couldn't believe how presumptuous and tasteless Sanders was in his tweet.  Definitely one of the reasons I'm here and a new donor to the cause.  Biden was my first hope in the fight to end the trumptocracy, now he's my last.  Here's to a strong showing on Tuesday!  Cheers!
Yeah, I'm sure Pete's supporters would join a movement consisting of a base that called him a rat among other derogatory things.
I read that earlier and thought "What an incredibly presumptuous lack of tact."
I'm a very *very* strong Pete supporter.  However, after the way Bernie has implicitly allowed his supporters to trash Pete and other candidates, I'm all in for Joe.  He's the best chance we have to beat Trump and, most importantly, he's an actual decent human being.  I can't take the ridiculous astroturfing on r/Pete_Buttigieg from disingenuous Bernie supporters trying to feign outrage at Bernie's staff doxxing Pete tonight.  It's so gross.  Anyway, I wish I still had my ballot to vote for Joe but I mailed it in a week ago.  Thanks for the nice welcome everyone.  This is how you *actually* welcome people.
Republican here. Biden all the way!!!
Very Trumpian.
I voted for Pete early here out in California, wish I could revote for Biden given the recent turn of events, looked up the rules and unfortunately I can't revote( I could be wrong). Nevertheless I will be supporting Joe Biden the rest of the way. I remember the interactions I had with some Biden supporters and it was pleasant and there was respect despite differences in opinion. Same unfortunately can't be said for Sanders supporters. I don't want to label people but patterns appear. Going to collegel in California, nearly everyone is voting for Sanders. One day the  Sanders club was tabling and asked who I was voting for. After saying Pete, they started questioning my allegiance to millennials and how I would vote for a Wall Street millionaire.( They already had their facts wrong). That interaction left a sour taste in my mouth. As the title says I was taught to judge people on how they treat other when they are at their lowest and their highest.
Sanders has some nerve asking Pete supporters to join him. This guy did his very best to delegitimize Pete's win in Iowa and stood silently as his supporters went all out to call Pete a rat and used many homophobic slurs.
I’m a die hard Pete person. The contrast between those two tweets is exactly why I subbed here today.   Rally around Biden, stop Sanders and Trump, Pete for Sec. of Defense! I can absolutely live with that.
This is an insightful post. The juxtaposition really does speak volumes.
This tweet was, for me, the straw that broke the camel's back as far as supporting Sanders.
God I hate Bernie Sanders. The man is so transparently self serving. As if his “movement” is the only viable option.
Many Bernie supporters idolize him, and act like fools.  It really helped push me away from Bern, and vote for Pete instead.  I am going to support Biden going forward.
I used to maintain more of a benefit-of-the-doubt mindset with Bernie, like, "I disagree with some of his beliefs but I respect that he seems to be honest about it."  This election season so far has eroded that faith in him as a person. He's been nothing but an egotistical jackass who refuses to compromise with anyone and who continues to run even though, statistically speaking, a man his age who just suffered a heart attack has a *very real* chance of not even surviving his first term!   Anyone not in love with themselves would realize they need to bow out and support a healthier progressive alternative (like Warren). But no, not Our Lord And Savior Saint Bernard. I'll vote for him if he's the nominee, but I'm done trying to like him for the sake of diplomacy.
Thank you 💎 Joe. We Pete fans appreciate it. Let's win this thing! Unity beats division. Kindess beats anger. Respect beats trying to cannibalize on our votes just hours after Pete dropped out.
You expect him to praise Pete? Bernie has criticized Pete heavily and he's not going to pander to Pete's supporters by giving Pete empty flattery.
Sanders is basically Trump at this point!!!!!
[removed]
I thought Bernies comment was fine.
In fairness Bernie may not tweeted that I don’t think he meant any harm. But regardless I’m team joe now
Yeah, using the words "our" and "us" is such a selfish prick move.
[removed]
😎🍦
Went to Sanders' Twitter and couldn't find the tweet. Did he delete it?
You are correct.  Many (if not most) of us have a horrible taste in our mouth from Sanders supporters and his tacit tolerance of their behavior.
Who do you plan on voting for in the general?
It's a bit narcissistic but it's not **that** bad. Trump has the mentality of a dim-witted middle school bully.
The only thing liberals seem to dislike about Trump is that he is unkind.
This is why you don’t early vote unless you have a late primary.
Plus the whole thing where he kept calling Buttigieg a billionaire puppet based on 0.2% of his total campaign funds. Sorry Pete didn't have the opportunity to do what you did by transferring senate money, use several PACs, and run long after being mathematically eliminated in 2016 so he can get more money as you he essentially nonstop (except for a couple months in the 2016 general) for five years.
Sanders is literally running ads claiming he's the first candidate ever to win Iowa, NH, and Nevada.  Such bullshit. Pete won IA and multiple other candidates including Gore and Kerry won all three as well.
His volunteers were also sending out texts saying he won Iowa, as well as NH and NV. I was like, nah, Pete won Iowa.
[removed]
Word.  I completely agree.  Although I think Pete wouldn't be a bad VP choice, but Sec Def would be very fitting as well.
Wait are you also a mod here? Is there somewhere you aren't a mod?
I hate when people say this. I don't care who you support. People say on reddit, "oh I was a big supporter, but this. THIS is why I'm no longer a supporter".  &#x200B;  Get real dude. I hate Sanders as much as the next guy, but these types of comments are idiotic. Nobody believes them.
You're making your decision on who should hold the most powerful office in the world based on a tweet that a staffer wrote? It's not even an offensive tweet; it's pretty typical of a presidential campaign to welcome new support. I don't support Sanders either, but this seems really silly.
How?
There’s no concrete proof of this. And it’s not self-serving. Pete had no path forward and I think he would much rather Biden win than Sanders.
It's *fine* but a bit thoughtless at least, with strong hints of narcissism.
It was tweeted in his name, it doesn’t matter who actually did it. People need to stop excusing everything bad about Bernie by saying “he didn’t do it” or “he didn’t say it”. A man is just as much who he surrounds himself with.
The staffer who doxxed Pete should be fired, but he won’t be. If anything comes of it, Sanders will just brush it off saying he doesn’t condone it, the asshole who published Pete’s personal cell number will remain on the campaign, and Bernie’s cult will continue to use homophobic slurs and rat emojis to spam anything Pete tweets for the rest of his career.  That’s who these people are. They are evil.
Colorado Governor Jared Polis? Is that you?
https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/1234299309522325505?s=21
Biden
Pete was Iowa. It’s been confirmed multiple times, and it was even confirmed he won it by a larger margin than previously thought.   And Bernie simply disregarded the behavior of these people, taking no ownership of them, saying that they are not part of his movement.
Ohh fuck off you dishonest little shit. Buttigieg declared victory in Iowa based on his internal numbers showing him winning. Guess why no other campaign declared victory? Because their numbers also showed Buttigieg had won. And he did win. It was a lot closer than the internal numbers showed, but it was a victory never the less. Litterally every other candidate in the race would have done the same thing if they had been the ones being fucked over by the Iowa democratic party and denied their victory by it's incompetence.  > And to say he stood silent is incredibly disingenuous. He denounced anyone doing personal attacks while calling themselves Bernie supporters. He has done so in interviews, town-halls and the big debates.  Yeah Bernie have made the gestures. Then he has his campaign staff go out and continue to encourage his supporters just like he let high level campaign staff campaign for Jill Stein in 2016.
I would love a Biden-Buttigieg ticket, but I think there is no way he doesn’t pick a woman as his running mate.
We love him anyways!
r/neoliberal
Bernie spoke to the press before the tweet was posted and literally said the exact same thing. I don’t think it alone should determine ones support, but it’s pretty tasteless and in line with Bernie’s massive ego.
I doubt staffers write these tweets. Maybe they edit these official statements ("We need you to draft an official statement,") but assuming outright fabrication is highly cynical.
He still did not congratulate him or acknowledge Pete had won Iowa. Sanders is a sore loser.
Even if he tweeted I didn’t see anything egregious. Also look at my comment history and you’ll know I’m anything but a bernie apologist. I just don’t like stopping down to his supporters level and nitpick on things that aren’t a big deal
This kind of shit is toxic in our political discourse. Criticize the individuals, but don't generalize every Bernie supporter as evil over the actions of a few. That's just being hateful.
I wish 😔🍦
That would be u/jaredpolis
The comments are hilarious. Tons of people pretending to be former Pete supporters switching to Bernie, yet their tweet history is just calling Buttigieg a rat.
Larger margin? Margin in SDE was smaller than 0,5%. And Bernie won the popular vote, both initial and realignment. What's wrong in saying that?  I am not here to say that Bernie did enough. I honestly have no idea what he even possibly could do more(would be interested to hear this). However, the argument was that he has been silent which he clearly hasn't been. On the contrary he has strongly disavowed those who attack other candidates. He has avoided other questions, not this one.
😐✊
Eh. People are always way more sensitive and reactionary to things when it's a candidate they want to see lose. I really don't think this was worth even making a thread about.
My larger point is that it's really not a tweet worth being offended by, regardless of who wrote it.
All current and former 2020 DNC candidates simply congratulated Pete on his campaign and what he managed to accomplish. Only Bernie makes it about him.
I’m calling a spade a spade. All I’ve seen for months from the Bernie Bros is Homophobia. I won’t forget that, it I won’t ever forgive that.
😔
The fact that a current governor shitposts on Reddit is hilarious and amazing.
They should make it less obvious at least
>  he has strongly disavowed those who attack other candidates  When? He simply said they are not part of his movement and then combines them into the conversation about Russian and pro-Trump trolls. He takes zero responsibility for the hate and divisiveness he is spreading.
Maybe in isolation. But it absolutely shows a trend of narcissism, smugness and divisiveness that his campaign and supporters are justifiably infamous for.
Briahna Joy Gray makes it hard not to scrutinize Bernie's press releases.
Agreed
Are you basing this purely off internet comment sections or something? It's absolutely ridiculous to think all Bernie supporters are anti-gay, and even more ridiculous to make sweeping generalizations about people like that. I guarantee you it's at most a small minority of his support.
I'm not even from Colorado but I'm a big polis fan
 > I guarantee you it's at most a small minority of his support.  A high level Bernie campaign staffer and media surrogate doxxed him today on twitter, published his personal cellphone number. They had to disconnect his phone number because of the sheer amount of death threats and spam phone calls that were coming in. Most of the evidence of that is posted on pro-Bernie twitter accounts. That’s not a small minority, that is the Bernie campaign perpetuating an act of violence against the first openly gay presidential candidate. And no one from the campaign had apologized.   Seriously, if you don’t look at what I just said, and come away completely disgusted and appalled, and question Bernie’s humanity, then you’re not worth my time.
Can you give me links to what you're talking about?
If Trump and accomplices go ahead with trying to smear Biden’s son, Bloomberg adviser Tim O’Brien says they’re ready to respond with ads about the Trump crime family
I love Bloomberg the attack dog so much more than Bloomberg the candidate
My stance on Bloomberg has drastically flipped in less than a week. What an interesting time we live in.
God I love this coalition. Bloomberg’s ad team combined with Pete’s ground game, Amy’s legitimacy and hopefully Warren’s progressives. It’s going to be a strong democratic election.   Obama won through coalition building. This is a little different but works all the same.
Good. Ivanka and the others benefit from their position in government
Trumps problem will be that he doesn't get the free tv time like 2016 and at some point the rich guys will not want to throw good money after bad. His funds will dry up while Bloomberg can bury him.
>ads about the Trump crime family  But why aren't they doing that **now**?
Back in 2016 Trump and the GOP had the heavy propaganda machine. This year we have Bloomberg's billions. Ads are going to get interesting in the general.   I don't like Bloomberg as a person, but I'm ok with a truce and appreciate his support to beat Trump.
HNNNNNNNNGGGGGH!!!
Let the games begin.
Just talk about how Trump broke the law investigating Biden and how McTurtle covered it up.
Bloomberg is a good example of how people are very complicated. He's done very shitty things, and he's done very good things (his funding of gun control in particular). I'm grateful that he's going to pour billions into flipping swing states and attacking Trump.
and I oop-
I can’t wait for Biden Son vs Trump Kids
Hate him as a candidate, love to have him on our side.     What's the word for that?
Plz Bloomberg , it's inappropriate for me to walk around in public like this..
This wouldn’t be news to most people. Trump supporters don’t care about that
Still need to clearly answer the allegations tho. Go on the offensive, clear his name, then give them a great big shame on you for smearing his son.   Key off of Pete's defense.   https://youtu.be/tbCIMClWrd4
Respect to Mr. Bloomberg !! Finally going where we should have been long ago ! Right on ! So over those sloppy af grifters !
Why don’t they just reapond withnads about the trump crime family beforehand? If you know there is evil, expose it! No?
Is this the democracy we live in? If one corrupt politician attacks another corrupt politician for having a corrupt son, a corrupt billionaire air ads about the original corrupt politician???
The difference is that Trump fans already know this and will still vote for them.  Democrats though might hesitate and not vote.  So you can play this game but I think you need to do something else.
Love the team.  Each person has a nice little niche.  Joe just needs to be Joe.
I remember Bill Maher saying the for Democrats to win, we needed to find our “Steve Bannon-type”   Maybe it’s the guy who took on the NRA, backed 40 democrats in house races, and poured millions into climate change
Same though
Does Bloomberg's ex-candidate status allow him to bypass laws that would keep him from going all out support the nominee?
I've always wanted the Dems to have some billionaires backing them, because thems the rules we have. I just don't want the billionaires buying their own seats. When we change the rules to get this kind of money out of politics, the country will be better off, but until then, Bloomberg is necessary.
I had many issues with Bloomberg as a candidate for president that I don't have as Bloomberg as a person or political activist.
Let’s make sure we leave room for the Bernie crowd to bring progressive ideas as well. Warren brings the wonky, difficult details to progressive plans, while Bernie brings the passion and ideological drive to keep pushing society forward. I’m excited for this general.
Same. A Biden campaign volunteer called me tonight to invite me to a campaign event in Detroit. That’s the first time I ever received a campaign call. Even though I moved from MI, I did vote for Joe in SC last week.
Timing is everything. People have a tendency to only remember what's fresh, especially when there's so much to wade through.
Because we're nearing the election
Also I can say as someone who's airways were blanketed with Bloomberg ads for a good month before the Super Tuesday vote, Bloomberg hired a really good ad team.
That didn’t work the first time
Nope. Process arguments don't persuade people.  Hunter never should have gotten that job and that's what people flirting with voting blue want Biden to answer on.
We should get a debate. Make it an undercard.
hypocrite
But it may reaffirm for people that are feeling defeated by Hunter/Ukraine ads, and feeling unmotivated to vote that Trump IS in fact much much worse.
 >This wouldn’t be news to **most people.**  I have some really bad news for you about the Fox News demographic & polticially apathetic American public...
Allegations of what exactly ? This has been investigated to death over nothing illegal to begin with.
Bloomberg is throwing unprecedented sums of his vast fortune at showing TV-watching ignoramuses who Donald Trump truly is. Forget the haters; he's a patriot. 🇺🇸
It's like a heist
This exactly. You can’t change the system when the rules the system gives you are fucked up. We have to win with the rules given by the system first and only then can we go ahead and enact campaign finance reform.
Right?! We just want Billionares buying out the candidates not the seats!
Same. If he wants to pour his money into social causes, good for him. If he wants to pour his money into buying the presidency, fuck him.
For sure! I just didn’t want to count Bernie in yet. I feel it’d be dissrespectful to him and his supporters to count him out.  That said, if Biden does pull off this primary I sure hope Bernie jumps in and brings his passion to the forefront. While there may not be a cabinet position in store for Bernie, Biden might be able to put numerous young progressives into leadership positions within his administration.  That’s really what I’m hoping for. I want Biden’s administration to be the administration of passing the touch. Thrusting young progressives and New Democrats to the forefront and giving them the experience they need to carry the party forward. In order for that to happen though we will defiantly need Bernie’s support
Same. In a Super Tuesday state and I saw a shit ton of ads. I also never skipped them so that he'd be out more money (if I understand that correctly) so I watched all of them. His ad people are top notch because I was almost starting to believe the shit.
Glad to hear. I think we are going to need all the help we can get.
Which election was that?
Joe Biden did nothing to get his son a job.  He has no control over his adult children.   Meanwhile, Trump's children sit in government offices with taxpayer-funded salaries and cry about nepotism.
Ohhh, the Trump troll who LARPs as a progressive doesn't like to be called out on r/politics so he follows me here.
Yes. Be weary of anyone who pretends they haven't made colossal screw ups in their professional or personal lives - Bloomberg is giving vast amounts of his wealth to improve America the best ways he knows how to and has given decades of his life to public service besides creating tonnes of jobs
[removed]
Real question what's the best strategy for that with Citizens United being a thing? I mean obviously we could say "constitutional amendment" but we all know that's not politically possible right now, so it has to be something that can be done with Congress, and something that will be upheld by the current court.
I wouldn't have been nearly as annoyed by his running if he just got in and competed in the first 4 contests like everyone else, but his strategy of getting in late and spoiling the moderate lane, when everyone else played the game and realized there was no path so they got out before delegates mattered, really bothered me.   I mean Super Tuesday could have just as easily netted Bernie 100 delegates from Bloomberg slipping in at 20% of the vote everywhere like he did in Colorado. We're lucky a lot of voters choose to hold off until election day opposed to early voting to see how South Carolina went (myself being one of these voters).
The reality is Bernie isn't out, Biden has to win 51% of the remaining delegates to become the nominee but Bernie only has to win 54%.  Now, the upcoming states from now until the election is over all pretty much favor Biden except for a few low delegate states, and a few high delegate states that probably won't break strongly in one direction or another, but with the math what it is now I certainty wouldn't give up if I were them.
The one that went 52-48.
If Joe did nothing to get him the job then *that* is the response. Talking about Trump just congress across as deflecting which suggests the lack of an answer on the merits.
What are you talking about?  I have no idea who you even are nor do I care.  I voted for Biden and haven't been on /r/politics in at least a month because it is a pro-Sanders sub and I absolutely detest that man as you should too.  https://i.imgur.com/rrRfpEo.jpg?1  As for you, you have disturbing views on Biden.  https://np.reddit.com/r/DemocratsforDiversity/comments/fbrltj/dfd_discussion_thread_march_01_2020/fj7hebj/
This is not ROTR.
The statistical probability of Bernie winning is 1 in 50... Biden’s is 7 in 8. The math is not on Bernie’s side... of course that’s never stopped him before
Which one was that?
I agree with you, but if he gives that answer Trump calls him a corrupt liar and we're back to square one.
Trump’s corruption is the most important issue in this election. He is destroying our democracy with Republican collusion.
I'm gonna furiously masturbate behind 7-11 to save you.  When good things happen to you, you can thank me.
What is this ROTR?
 We're talking about swing voters. Guess how much you get to decide what is the most important issue for them.
We have standards for behavior here, imported from the PeteForAmerica campaign when Pete Buttigieg became part of the Biden campaign. Calling progressives stupid? That's not how we do business.

Uh thanks attractive young woman “blackz4trump” you’re totally not a weird troll
im a trump supporter but Biden for the win
why is this a live discussion? lol
🥁🍦🥁🍦🥁🍦🥁🍦
Well that was weird
Another good reason to vote for Joe
Most Democrats will vote for Joe, many moderates who don't like Trump will vote for Joe.  But the biggest challenge would be gathering enough grassroot level volunteers to work for Joe. For door knocking and get out the vote on eday.  I believe Hillary was outnumbered by Trump when it comes to door knockers and rally attendants.   Grass root workers will decide the election.
Obama should have forced Scalia’s replacement through.
Come on, Roberts is by no stretch an "ultraconservative". Thomas and *maybe* Alito could be called that, anything else is a stretch.
What incentive do progressives have to vote for Joe if, rather than "ultra conservative" judges being put in by Trump, simply "conservative" judges are put in by Biden?
I am VERY worried about the election process with this COVID-19 spreading. Everyone is all "we'll just move the election online!" and everything will be OK. Um, can we not?
If you think grassroots organizing and door knocking is key to the election, doesn't that make Joe Biden the less electable candidate?
And you know Moscow Mitch will call the Democrats corrupt if they were to do the same
How could he have done that?
So "ultraconservative" that he rescued the ACA twice and has the highest number of unanimous opinions (IIRC, his rate is higher that Rehnquist).
Either way.  You get the point. If Trump wins he’ll probably replace RBG with Sarah Palin! Lol
Is that a joke?
No one's saying this.
The virus will of pretty much ran it's course by November
Right now we have to flatten the curve by practising social distancing. Joe Biden and Bernie won't help the situation by holding rallies etc.  Bernie must drop out promptly. He will not win. If he does, the Midwest and the south will not vote for him in droves. These people came out for Biden in the primaries and will do it in the general. California, Washington (state) and New York will have no choice but to vote Biden. He will win.  I've been against online voting for ages, but I don't like the idea of hundreds of people waiting in lines in November. It's probably a bit too early for this to make a call, and I'm not confident a solid online solution can be developed, let alone developed by November. It will break/be tampered with.
I think getting votes is key to the election, so Joe is the most electable
Not scaring the living shit out of everyone over thirty is also key.
Yes, I think grassroot organizing is indeed Joe's weakness. His strength is that he's pulling a lot of moderate voters.  But if they don't do a better job at inspiring youth we'll have to accept Trump again.
By appointing him and asserting the Senate refused to comply with their constitutional duties. It would likely have gone to SCOTUS, who likely would have found it to be a non-justiciable political question.
This
Recess appointment.
To be fair, RBG had a chance to and should have bowed out during the Obama years but I guess Democrats assumed they'd just win the next election...  That was a bad call.
I got that some folks in our camp think it's okay to lie to score cheap political points. If I wanted that malarkey I'd go watch videos on S4P.
We don’t know that.
The ripple effects are going to last for much longer. This is an economic disaster, and it's exposed the Trump and his administration as the incompetent frauds that they are. The only "accomplishment" Trump could point to was the stock market, and that dissolved in a matter of days.
I'm not sure what each state has but in Florida we have early voting, so that reduces the size of the crowds day of.
What do you mean.
Would his apointee Merrick Garland get to rule this case if Obama did that?
 It he didn’t even try.  Obama lost so much of his fire by his second term.
Garland would no longer be on the Court though, so we're back to square one.
I saw this nonsense in another thread.  I doubt the justices make their career decisions on reading political tea leaves.  They serve their term and let the politicians handle the fall out.  You have to win elections if you want to appoint justices.  Moscow Mitch has made it clear that we need to take the Senate too.
Trump says so - it's all gonna just disappear.
By the model the CDC is using in my state the virus is expected to peak late April early May.   That's all I know.
Mail in votes would be a great interim solution.
No.
He almost certainly would have recused himself.
Justices have made their career decisions reading the political tea leaves since the beginning.  She decided that she didn't need to jump on the Obama opportunity, and that she would hold out for the next democrat.  That's fine, and it's her right to make that choice, but the idea that Supreme Court justices aren't watching to see who will select their replacements is naive.
Are you denying that this happened? Because it definitely did happen, people were concerned about both her age (80) and health, no tea leaves were necessary: https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSBRE9630C820130704  You’re free to have whatever opinions you want about this, but it’s not unreasonable to suggest that at 80 years old and the possibility of an upcoming Republican administration she could have stepped down and let a younger judge in and we wouldn’t be having this conversation.
McConnell is more corrupt than Trump. Speaking as a history teacher here. His total disregard for the Constitution is atounding.
I don't deny that there's people that might have wanted her to retire, but there's a tradition of supreme court justices being independent and above politics, at least the ones that care about being a good justice.  I count RBG as one of those.  You want more progressive justices ?  Win some elections, take the senate.  The right wing evangelicals got in bed with a guy who pays hush money to porn stars for chrissakes.  You think that was because they like him ?  What will the Bernie bros and independent voters do in November?  Stay tuned...

I actually am kind of looking forward to the rest of the debates. I think now we can focus on mainline Dem vs revolution. I have some concerns about how (if?) the debates will go in the general and think Biden could use the practice getting sharper.

I agree, if Biden approaches the next debate with Sanders the right way, he could give himself a great opportunity to start appealing to undecided voters in the general election. He can basically position himself as, "Bernie over there is for the far left, Trump is for the far right, I'm for ordinary Americans."

Joe debuts new policy: Ice Cream for all
I prefer a public ice cream option.
I don't think it's radical for the IRS to give each person an ice cream cone after filing taxes.
I4A    Nationalize Ben and Jerry's
Donald Trump promised me that if Hillary Clinton won the election there would be, and I'm quoting here, "Taco trucks on every corner."  Unfortunately we never got to find out if he was right or not.  As President will Joe Biden support a taco truck amendment to the constitution?  It is my sincere hope that he will.      💎🐊
Republicans: wtf? I like vegetables now?
can  we also do taco truck on every corner? That's what I was promised last time.
As someone who is both sugar sensitive and lactose intolerant i’m more in the Ice Cream For All Who Want It camp
I’m gonna need a picture of him eating his veggies, to balance out all these ice cream pics 😂
ice cream gives me intense gas. i switched to coconut and it was gross. i dont know what to do if this becomes law.
fIsCaLlY IrReSpOnSiBlE
That should really resonate with suburban soccer moms. Gotta win that key constituency.

Ice cream is cool and all, but with Hillary we were gonna have a taco truck on every corner, and I could go for a taco right now...

Ice Cream for All Who Want It
You're insane? Banning private ice cream is the only way we're going to drive down the price of ice cream. You're only voting for Biden because you WANT everyone to be without ice cream! Well, I hope you're happy when Biden is president and all you get is FroYo!
Some of us are lactose intolerant Mr. Senator. Icecream4All might not be the best solution.
I don’t think it’s radical for the USPS to deliver an ice cream cone to each person with their mail
In San Antonio, it’s pretty much the case no matter who won heh.
Ice Cream Tacos!
Same lol. I’m sure Joe would be ok with some dairy-free low sugar options for us ;)
[Best I could do.](https://i.redd.it/lv55ttdx5il41.jpg)      [All credit goes to "Wine Country for Pete" on twitter.](https://mobile.twitter.com/wc4pete/status/1236719998002814976?s=21)      Oh... it's on the front page.  Nevermind.

Lmao 10/10

No worries, I never get tired of looking at this!
It's okay to be a centrist or a moderate.
Of course! This country is supposed to represent folks of different stripes.   I've stopped using those terms altogether since the 'far left' has co-opted them to mean anything other than someone like Sanders ('progressive'), presumably to make you feel like your lagging behind them in terms of moral character and thus guilt trip you into voting for someone you don't align with.  (E.g if you're a centrist you stand in the way of progress - a load of malarkey)
We need progressives for our vision but progress always always always happens in the center via compromise. We gotta work together.
A lot of us feel that way. I am certainly a liberal, maybe even a progressive, by normal standards. I believe in a welfare state, and I think the government should have some power to regulate companies if they behave in a way that hurts people. However, there's a big difference between wanting universal healthcare and supporting things like the CFPB, and Bernie's plan to abolish private insurance, guarantee federal jobs, and implement nationwide rent control. In 2016, I liked him because he campaigned on the idea of bringing plans that worked in other countries to the US, but now he's gone totally off the deep end and is proposing things that, for the most part, have only been tried in autocratic communist countries. Liberal and socialist are distinct identities, and we're not wishy-washy for not supporting their extreme policies.
There’s nothing wrong with believing in putting aside our differences to achieve a greater good.  Just don’t kid yourself into thinking that those across the aisle have any interest in working with anyone with a D next to their name.   We don’t live in that world anymore. I wish we did; but it’s gone, and there is no indication of it returning anytime soon.  Sadly, the only way to “get anything done” is to win the presidency AND both houses of Congress, and then hold them for several terms. Otherwise the next administration simply dismantles everything that has been achieved.
I hope this isn't too much of a disgression, but its been a bit surreal for me to watch candidates debate economics, and health care reforms that the Senate will never pass (No matter who the President is, Medicare for All will not land on his desk), and even more surreal that this has actually been the debate people want to see, which is why those are the questions the media asks and the candidates bring up.  Russian interference changed the course of the 2016 Presidential election in the US, and they are trying to do it again.  The current President openly asked for their aide during the campaign and believes Putin over our own intelligence agencies, and aides and abetted by the Senate Majority Leader is blocking the more stringent efforts to acknowledge and stop Russia from going even further in 2020.  And, of course, he withheld defense funding for an allied nation that Russian troops were and are partially occupying because he wanted their Prime Minister to go on television and announce he was opening a spurious investigation into an American politician's *son* who isn't involved with politics, hoping it would cause the guy's family a political scandal.  How much of a psychopath do you have to tell a foreign leader of a democratic country that you're going to take away their weapons and just let Russia march into Kiev and hang them all because daggonit you want them to subvert their own justice system and go after an American citizen who briefly made 40k a year working for a business there because it'd let you score political points against a political rival here at home?  That's the real issue here.  I wouldn't even necessarily say the misconduct that Trump was impeached for directly (Though the House was right to impeach him and the Senate should have convicted) is that issue in and of itself (Though its certainly related), so much as that we need to take measures to make sure we stay a democracy (Or as close as the electoral college, House gerrymandering, and the Senate having been set up to give low populated states more power will allow, anyhow).  Do we get to decide who are our leaders are, or does Moscow?  What if China wants to get involved? Do they just start doing counter-influence campaigns and hacking and see who's computer hacking and psychological manipulation is better at getting them the puppet of their nation's choice to lead *our* country?  To me, this is a foreign policy election.  I want to preserve America's ability to select our own leaders.  That's why I support Joe Biden.  That the Cold War hawks in the Republican Party support Donald Trump tells me everything I need to know about the state of that party right now.  They went from Joe McCarthy to letting Vladimir Putin pick the President.  People are missing the bigger picture.  I think Sanders has done a great job advocating for Social Security, healthcare, and other domestic issues these last 5 years or so.  He's changed the center of political gravity in the Democratic Party on those things, and mostly for the better. Its not that everyone endorses what Sanders puts forward, although more do than they used to, but by showing there is, or creating, a constituency for those ideas, the more moderate candidates have to define their views in terms of talking about how much they should increase Social Security payouts and not in terms of how much to cut them. Its helpful, and good for him for making that happen.  Biden will be the most economically progressive nominee we've had in decades based on the platform he's articulated, and its in part because Bernie changed the terms of the debate.  In the end, though, Bernie was always going to be focused on domestic policy.  To the extent he thinks about foreign policy, I think its often though the prism of some sort of worldwide leftist movement.  Its not that he agrees with Putin's electoral interference, in fact he's rightly denounced it.  He just isn't often focused on foreign policy and, when he does, it sounds like we'd signing up for something that is just as dramatic a break with norms as Trump, just in a different direction.  Biden will focus on foreign policy and will provide a traditional American foreign policy without the excesses of Bush 43 or someone like that. Just an honest to goodness use of our influence to contain Russia and China when they threaten us and our allies, and a robust attempt to strengthen NATO and other traditional alliances.  He knows how this stuff is done- you all may remember that one debate where started rabid fire technical talk about repositioning the Pacific fleet and most of the other candidates looked like deer caught in the headlights.  Joe will make progress if elected, but mostly he'll try to restore the way things were.  Lets hope we haven't already lost too many of our non-partisan civil servants to fix our institutional bureaucracy and get this thing back on track.
I like the idea of “working across the aisle,” but do we really believe that republicans are going to work with Biden though?
r/centerleftpolitics r/moderatepolitics
Spoken like someone on the LEFT /s  I really wish rank choice and Civic Ed had a baby so we could have a multi-party system where people know the difference between them and politicians aren't confusingly under broad party labels
This is not about individual labels. It's not about "I'm a centrist" or "I'm a progressive". The issues start at the top. This is the establishment vs the others.  This market crash is looking like the crash of 1929 when Hoover was in power. How did they fix it back then? They voted for FDR. They used terms like "Socialist" and "Communist" to describe FDR. He was so popular he got elected 4 times. They set term limits because a "socialist" was so popular. They had to have a fourth ballot at the convention before he finally got it.  Exit polls are consistently showing the people want medicare for all. Obviously, it's not translating well into actual votes.  I completely understand why someone may want a moderate but the idea that both parties work with each other on the big issues is the real 'malarkey'. Did we forgot how much push back Obama was given?  I'll vote blue no matter what. But I have to disagree with saying that a moderate will magically unite both parties and work together.  I have this conversation every other week with coworkers. I would love it if they worked together but the old days where the parties worked together seem to be gone.
I’m a proud liberal who’s somewhat left of Biden, but he’s the best man for the job. I came aboard last November.
Bernie served to make progressive ideas more palatable. He lost mainly because people were unsure he could beat Trump, not because they disliked his policies
I also think it's absolutely okay to be a centrist. Problem with Joe is, he's too much of a 'meh'. It's like we're having a guy run for president just for the sake of it. This will be Joe's biggest challenge that is to overcome his 'meh' status.
Could you elaborate on what you mean by Trumps fascism?
Of course it is, nothing wrong with most political positons from the social democrat (no not socailist) policies of sanders to the quite on the right policies of a kasisch .
Naaayce. Yep, the virtue signalling is strong with this one. Good malarkey detection skills.
Civil rights movement?  Gandhi?  Emancipation of slavery?

I was kinda hoping we'd go towards the direction of Multi-payer healthcare like Germany. But I'd rather go toward single payer than having Trump as president.
I think universal single payer is the ultimate goal, and really the only way to guarantee complete coverage to everyone while also controlling costs, but with our current system being so entrenched giving a true public option to start off seems like the smart move.    Given legislation to allow it to negotiate costs better than Medicare currently does (and thus make premiums affordable) it should become a popular choice, which will eventually allow it to take over the market.
> and Bernie's plan to abolish private insurance   Afaik he doesnt.   &#x200B;  > but now he's gone totally off the deep end and is proposing things that, for the most part, have only been tried in autocratic communist countries. Liberal and socialist are distinct identities, and we're not wishy-washy for not supporting their extreme policies.   No what sanders proposes is the case in most european countries. Its normal policy there, not some extre elefty positions. Sanders after all is centre left in reality, he just seems far left due to skewed US politics.
While its true, focusing too hard on foreign interference makes us seem demented. And younger generations seem more accepting of foreign people getting involved in US politics. Its not illegal for foreigners to volunteer for campaigns and there are news articles about Canadians and Australians working for Sanders. I've seen a picture of claimed German volunteers as well. We know the Russians and Chinese infiltrate campaigns to get policy info, and Israel heavily tries to influence US choices, with Saudi Arabia suspected as being the source of much of Sanders current campaign donations.  I hate it. But if most younger Americans think of themselves as world citizens whom anyone else can decide their leaders or, for Republicans, cheer on a hostile nation targeting their enemies and do nothing to punish the perpetrators, it seems a lost war.
I agree that Trump isn't literally a fascist. But his broad disdain for the media, habitual factual misrepresentations, and superficial hyper-nationalism are traits that you'd expect from proto-fascists.   Patriotism and a skeptical approach to the media are positives traits, in my opinion, but Trump just takes these things and ratchets them up to a 10.
Okay yes some progress happens through civil war 🙄
Bad bot
Single-payer in the Sanders sense (banning private insurance) is actually incredibly rare. Really only the Nordic countries, Canada, and Britain have gone as far as he's suggesting (and even then, some of them still allow private insurance). Pretty much all of continental Europe has multi-payer universal, either with a public option, or with all private non-profits in a few cases like the Netherlands. I think just making Medicare available for anyone to opt into, and then enrolling uninsured people automatically is the smartest way to expand affordable coverage. I also think we should license private insurance at the federal rather than state level, so that companies can't have local monopolies on private insurance.
> I think universal single payer is the ultimate goal, and really the only way to guarantee complete coverage to everyone while also controlling costs  Why can that not be done through a public option? It'll be cheaper than private insurance, and you can have a subsidy for low income people who otherwise couldn't afford it.
Guaranteeing federal jobs and implementing nationwide rent control are radical policies that are NOT commonplace in Europe and have only ever really been done in autocratic communist countries. Rent control is one of those things that sounds like a really good idea on paper, but in reality it’s a band-aid fix to the real issue, which is that more and more people are moving to cities, and there simply aren’t enough places to live. The best solution is to make single-unit zoning laws illegal federally so that suburbs can be built up vertically, or at very least so suburban houses can be divided into townhomes. This will make rents lower naturally by simply increasing supply.  Guaranteeing everyone a government job is also going to seriously damage economic growth, as jobs will be created regardless of whether or not they provide value or a useful service, and suck people out of the private sector where they could actually be contributing to the economy. This is bad from a social democratic/liberal perspective because it limits the amount of tax revenue available to fund the welfare state. The reason countries like Sweden are able to have so many government programs is because they have a booming private sector that they use for tax revenue to fund them. Pulling tons of people out of the public sector while trying to massively expand the welfare state is a bad idea.
I don't understand this line of thinking at all. I'm of the younger generation and I will never accept it as ok for other countries to interfere in our elections. This is akin to attacking our country on our own soil and it should be treated as such.
The only thing that's prevented him from going full fascist is the courts. I believe that he has demonstrated he will pounce on the opportunity to consolidate power should it arise.

Whatever dude. Y’all just blind
A public option is a good middle ground and likely the best we can hope for for now, I’m not against going that route.    The areas where having universal single payer would be superior are:  no more worrying about in and out of network (not everywhere accepts Medicare right now for example) as everyone would be covered everywhere, with one insurer covering everyone the government could set reimbursement rates to control costs and mandate all facilities accept them as payment in full (and to be fair to providers and facilities ideally there would be a elected board of medical professionals setting the rates to be fair to both providers and the taxpayers), and it would save quite a bit on overhead when it comes to medical billing, collections, etc.    I could see a role for private insurance still existing in such a system as additional rider plans - for example having additional coverage that would allow you to upgrade to a private room at a hospital or cover vanity cosmetic procedures.
Rent control and loads of people working in gov are part of normal "way of working" for most eu countries.  &#x200B;  > and have only ever really been done in autocratic communist countries   Plese stop with that autocratic communist nonsene . Sanders and the democratic left are demorats not communists nor autocratic . If you want that, look at trump who has acted a lot more autocratic then any president before.  &#x200B;  > The reason countries like Sweden are able to have so many government programs is because they have a booming private sector that they use for tax revenue to fund them.    Its ironic you dont see that both go hand in hand: if you have eduated productive/healthy workers you tend to have a good private sector.
Yeah. ☹ Unfortunately, because of foreign interference and Republican dirty tricks operations like Erik Prince's Operation Chaos, you never know if someone is a real supporter, a foreigner with possibly bad agenda, or a Republican trying to fuck things up. Old interviews with the paid Russian bot people say they were supposed to create a toxic atmosphere online, similar to how the KGB faked race war propaganda in the 50s and 60s. The idea being to use American openness against itself.  When a supporter is toxic or spreads disinformation, they might be doing so knowingly, to poison discourse. This is why I am wary of angry political supporters.
Blinded by this incredible opportunity to invest in chess sets!

Blind to what? Your conspiracy theories about Biden or your conspiracy theories about covid19? You regurgitated so much nonsense in your post it's hard to tell exactly why you're so upset.
Rent control might be normal, but MANDATED NATIONWIDE rent control is not. Wide-scale federal employment is normal, but GUARANTEED federal employment is not. If the government controlled all rents, there would be no incentive for anyone to build anything other than single-unit homes that will be bought, not rented, worsening sprawl, pollution (from long commutes), and furthering neighborhood segregation. We want to encourage density, not discourage it, and the way to do that is to make city living affordable by encouraging, or maybe even financially incentivising the building of high-density market-rate urban housing. Minneapolis has done this, and it has worked wonders, as the city has managed to grow massively from an economic standpoint while still being very affordable to live in. We need to encourage this sort of growth at a federal level.      On to federal jobs, I iterate again that even if there were a MASSIVE (bigger than planned by any candidate) increase in the size and roll of the federal government, there would not be enough work for the entire workforce, and so people would be sucked out of the private sector where they would actually create taxable wealth, to the public sector where they'd be using it. This is the difference between Venezuela and Sweden. In Sweden, their huge social safety net is funded by their large, well-taxed private sector. In Venezuela, they tried to fund a safety net by nationalizing their big industries, namely oil. The price of oil crashed, they couldn't keep up, and now they're in a conundrum where they don't have enough money to pay for programs and don't have the private sector lean on to create taxable wealth.      Lastly, I want to say that I absolutely agree with your point that a well-educated, healthy, and happy workforce is a good thing, and this is absolutely the roll of the welfare state, at least partially. I absolutely get that they go hand in hand, but I want you to see what I'm saying, which is that the roll of the state is not to micromanage industry, but to let it do its thing (unless it acts in a predatory or harmful manner) to produce wealth efficiently, and then the state skims some off the top to fund schools, healthcare, etc., for the people. It's better to have the private sector be the one generating the wealth and the public sector doing the welfare spending than to have the government doing everything.
Now we’re talking! Republicans vs Democrats in this historical debate! Only $40 and when the democratic candidates are selected they’ll notify you to purchase the additional pieces
Think bigger picture. It’s not just about Biden or Covid19, it’s about the lizard people creating distractions. Distracting us from their existence. I understand it’s hard to see at first, but once you start seeing them, you can’t stop
> Rent control might be normal, but MANDATED NATIONWIDE rent control is not.    When I look at belgium they have a form of mandated natioanwide rent control. You cant just up the rent without reason, and reason is you improved the value of the house.  &#x200B;  > Wide-scale federal employment is normal, but GUARANTEED federal employment is not.   When I look at it its more provide the incentives for green deal, infrastructure,... creating work. Your comparison with venezuala is pure freamongering and has nothig to do with this.  &#x200B;  > but I want you to see what I'm saying, which is that the roll of the state is not to micromanage industry, but to let it do its thing (unless it acts in a predatory or harmful manner) to produce wealth efficiently, and then the state skims some off the top to fund schools, healthcare, etc., for the people. It's better to have the private sector be the one generating the wealth and the public sector doing the welfare spending than to have the government doing everything.   Sanders doesnt propose to "micromanage industry" (ecept perhaps health care what is something special)  &#x200B;  Hence he's not really a socialist and has no problem with what you describe.
Wow and how much should I expect it to go up in value over ten years? 10%? 20%? 200%???
Shoot I reckon 25% compounded every 5 years or so. In 100 years your grand children will have a small fortune on their hands
In tough times like these it’s good to know there’s a solid investment like commemorative chess sets.
The trick is to never open it

Holy crap, I think that site updates in real time.  :-)
well we all know bernie will concede if he doesn't have the plurality of delegates, so there's a good chance
538 is now the establishment to Berners
Thank. God.
NO COMPLACENCY! GET THE FUCKING POKEMON GO TO THE POLLS TOMORROW
To the polls tomorrow, Super Tuesday people! I'll be at our polling place here in Birmingham bright and early. (Well, maybe not bright in the traditional sense, given that it's been raining all day and will be until Thursday, so it'll have to be more of an inward feeling of brightness.)
Shut the front door!!! I am so happy. Let's kick some socialist ass tomorrow!!!
This -> my veins
Warren at 0%... lol
This is great and all but don’t forget that 538 also gave Trump less than a 20% chance of winning the 2016 election. Personally, I agree with their prediction that the primary is going to go to the convention.
Go Joey Shades!
Shit, I feel like checking this all the time tomorrow
I'm actually really disappointed by this, was going to put more money on Biden but this has tanked the odds, now just  2x return.
I feel bad for 538. Their model is flying all over the place with the current election.
Biden is genuine. He doesn’t come across as demanding. I don’t know why the pundit rips him during debate all the time. I think if people sees his emotion, they can see this is really a guy doing this for the country. He is not doing this because of ego or pride or he think he has the best answer for everything, he is doing this for this country. That earns my respect.
Wooooo! No One 2020!  &#x200B;  Not me. Nothing.  A fresh end for America!  Void first!  I'm with nothing!  MAHA make America hollow again!
Based, can’t wait for the Bernie tears and seething. They’ll act like they’re Bernie or bust but will begrudgingly vote Joe in the primary anyway, can’t for Sanders to give Joe all his funds too.

I get lots of joy from reminding people I'm a millennial ethnic minority voter who supports Biden.
It is already
Every time an approved poll gets released (or when something that changes the dynamics of the election, e.g. after primary results, someone suspending their campaign, etc.
I need that laugh...only works other way round for bernie bros
You joke, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did!  They call everything that has accurate polling "rigged." Including the Iowa Caucus. Anything that doesn't outright endorse Bernie is the establishment.
hold your tits.  there's a lot of work to do.  lets go.
Came here to post just this. As an unaffiliated moderate scared to shit of both Trump or Sanders I am very happy to see the sane democrats consolidating behind Biden and hopefully just in time.  Thank. God.
Will be voting Biden tomorrow in Calhoun County.

Kinda sad really. She's pretty much as progressive as Bernie, but with an actual plan and has shown to get more things passed in her 10 years as opposed to Bernie's 30 years.  I also haven't heard anything bad from her fanbase.  &#x200B;  I also like that she's still in the race for all the times she will get to further eviscerate Bloomer.
Didn’t you hear? She has a convention strategy!
They were probably correct with that number. 20% chance seems pretty in-line with most other predictions. But 80% doesn’t mean 100%. Trump beat the odds.  I’d keep in mind that 538 has been pretty excellent this year so far.
Unlikely things still happen. Odds were against Trump winning, but a perfect storm of bad things happen, and they allowed him to win. 20% means low probability, not no probability.
Would you play a round of Russian Roulette? You only have a 17% chance of dying.
They gave him around 28% odds and this was higher than any other major forecaster in 2016.
Trump winning was the greatest political upset of all time.  If you gave him anything over 10% you are a genius.
In fairness, it has always been long Biden and Bernie, and short everyone else
r/dirtbagcenter
Do you know how probability works or did 538 predict that Hillary would have a 100% chance to beat trump?
17% chance vs 16% chance...  Hmm..... yeah equal 🤔
Then add in Pete's and Amy's delegates...
Reddit is insufferable
The Rules of the Road make it better
I’m a Gen Z Joe Biden voter and I’m the only one I know, but guess what? I’m the only person I know voting in the democratic primary.
None of what you said is really why Democrats are tired of him. And vilify is far too strong a word. He's piggy backed on Democratic primaries so many god damned times and just tosses it aside when he no longer needs it.
No they aren't, I see this argument about Medicare for all in particular and it just isn't true, pretty much all of the Western world still has private health insurance; Canada, France, Australia the UK all have widespread private health insurance. What Biden is offering is closer to what the rest of the Western world has, private insurance with a public system safety net to make sure everyone gets some form of healthcare no matter what and unlike Bernie's proposal, it stands a chance of actually making it through congress.
Seizing 20% of every big company without compensation is normal in western countries? That’s one of his actual policies.  Jeremy Corbyn got blown out in the UK with milder policy than that.  Also banning stock buybacks, codetermination with federal charters than can be revoked *by the executive* etc etc  Sanders is extremely left wing on a number of counts   And universal healthcare is not single payer. I’m from Singapore. We have universal healthcare. The system is a mix of private and public (health insurance plays a minimal role and is private), and we spend 1.5% of GDP on healthcare for among the best outcomes in the world.
That the hard left chose Bernie over Warren should be an absolute embarrassment. Does no one bother to compare legislative accomplishments? Do these people want to get anything done?
Agree 100%
Yeah. I’d love for them to be right. I just don’t want to get my hopes up too much. I’m still a bit raw from Pete dropping out.
Depends on the stakes. But good point though.
lol yeah, theyre not gonna start doing 1 in \[decimal\]
Do the deligates of candidates who dropped out get transferred?
Yep. This is about the only sub i visit these days lol. Rest of the site is utter garbage now, and thats coming from someone who used to spend time on probably hundreds of subs way back in the day when the site was great.
Universal healthcare does not mean that all private insurances are gone. It means that private insurances are more of a supplemental insurance. Canada, france, and the UK most definately do not use private insurance has their main insurance. The NHS in the UK isn't just a "safety net". Its the main insurance that almost all UK residents are entitled to it. Only 10.5% of people living in the UK have provate insurance. So I'm not really sire where you are getting this idea that they use a system based on private insurance.  And Bernies plan not being as likely to pass is kinda my point. We are literally so behind the curve becuase "socialism" bad even though what people here call socialism works in most countries.
>Seizing 20% of every big company without compensation is normal in western countries? That’s one of his actual policies.  Kinda. The government wouldnt be "seizing them". The corporation would have to set aside 20% of the company to be controlled by the workers. Kinda like a built in union. While that is more radical than most countries, Germany has a somewhat similar law where workers are elect some members onto the board of directors.   >And universal healthcare is not single payer.  I didnt say that it was.
> Seizing 20% of every big company without compensation is normal in western countries? That’s one of his actual policies.  It sounds like tax to me
No. Pete and Amy *suspended* their campaigns, meaning their delegates will not be distributed. If they chose to allow their delegates to distributed, they would go to candidates who were viable in Iowa and NH where they won those delegates - hence not Biden. The NV delegates won by Pete are not allowed to be distributed for whatever reason.
visit the innocent subs. woodworking, blacksmithing, powerwashingporn... there are many subs far away of the politics boogaloo
In Canada 30% of healthcare expenditure is privately funded, the French system is literally a government run health insurance akin to the public option proposal in the US except compulsory and does not fully reimburse medical costs, this hybrid of public and private healthcare has given France possibly the best healthcare system in the world. In the UK the NHS does not provide services as comprehensive as Sanders' plan and continues to underperform the private industry resulting in growing numbers of Britons taking out private healthcare. Bernie's plan to completely destroy the private healthcare industry and replace it with a publically run system is simply not consistent with the approach other countries have taken, and the idea that such a system can be fully constructed in four years is not realistic unless serious corners are going to be cut.  If you're aware Bernie's plan won't pass congress then why not get behind a plan that will? I agree that a system more akin to that of other western nations is what America needs, but the reality is we're only gonna be able to get there incrementally, the same way those other nations did, what Biden provides is a stepping stone that future presidents can further improve and expand, what Bernie provides is four years of bitter political deadlock in Congress that will probably drive people back to the Republicans in 2024 and ultimately kill off any hope for healthcare reform for at least a decade.
Codetermination is different from 20% worker share ownership. The government would be expropriating them, just handing them to workers after, because the value of existing shares would drop.  I’m okay with codetermination (or rather, can accept it, even if it’s not my preferred system).. Sander’s plan allows for companies to be shut down by the executive, though, if they “harm the community or employees”.
A expropriation of 20% of wealth, as a tax, would also be a hard no from me. With shares its more nefarious because people are being robbed of their *ownership* as well.
eh, those are somewhat insulated from the issues compared to political or tech/gaming subs, but in my experience, no sub ever really escapes the fundamental issues fully, they just occur less often. /r/coffee is a great example of that type of sub, and yet I still see it there. Lots of my hobbies are more tech/software/gaming oriented, and I disregard those types of subs completely because it's just circlejerks and the groupthink agenda upvoted, anything else won't be (usually downvoted instead), even if it's 100% factual but goes counter to the prevailing groupthink of the sub.   I actually work in enterprise software, and it's a bit like peeking behind the curtain to see Oz is just some dude, people try to pass shit off like they know what they're talking about if they make it "sound" like they do, but as a professional in the field, you see right through it whether it's bullshit on hardware or the various subjects surrounding software and software development.   Ain't even worth the time, the reddit upvote system fundamentally broke site-wide once the site reached a critical mass of people, the very reason it was designed ( to upvote good/factual content) ended up being its primary downfall, being used to perpetuate circlejerks and groupthink and drown out dissenting views that go against that viewpoint even when they're completely factual and are great contributions to the conversations. It's become a game of "who shouts the loudest wins" type of deal.

30% of healthcare in Canada being privately funded does not undermine what I said. And again: Only 10% of the UK uses private insurance. They are not system built as private insurance with a strong public safety net. They are first and foremost a strong public program with private supplemental.  And yeah, our private system should be destroyed. A new one will grow out of it, but our private system currently is cancerous and quickly strangling us. It in it's current form where the majority of people have to get healthcare through their place of employment is simply not compatible with a universal system.   >If you're aware Bernie's plan won't pass congress then why not get behind a plan that will?  Becuase I dont think Bidens plan is good enough. Why should I support a plan that's "better than nothing" when I currently have the chance to have my voice heard for what I really believe in? I will vote for Biden over Trump, but I'm not going to lie and pretend that I think his plan is what is best for the country just becuase so many Americans are ignorant about how the rest of the world has better systems than us, or how too many politicians are bought and paid for by the insurance industry. Baby steps arent good enough. Obama promised more and caved on the public option. I'm not going to support his VP in the primaries just to watch him cave also. I'm going to vote for the actual system that I think is the best option and I'm going to fight for that system for as long as possible.
It is different. I said simalar, not the same.
I hear ya...  I'm in the environmental regulatory compliance field, and know EXACTLY how / why regs are put in place.  Going to the r/environment sub can be so very frustrating.  You see people posting and mass-upvoting articles based on flawed data or blatant scaremongering all the time.  It is nigh-impossible to get a word in edgewise.  Every once in a while, I engage anyways because I'm a bit of a masochist, but its just so frustrating to feel like you're shouting into a hurricane....

So you've admitted that Bernie's plan to eliminate private healthcare is not consistent with the systems of other countries and you've admitted that his plan won't pass congress yet you still support it. Bud, sending a message is all good and well but there are people out there who genuinely need healthcare reform now. The fact that you would genuinely ask why you should support a plan that's better than nothing is astounding to me, of course you should support a plan that's better than nothing, because it's better than nothing, it genuinely boggles my mind why Sanders supporters feel sending some sort of message is somehow better than getting actual reform, you need to look at the political reality. If Sanders spends his presidency in political deadlock and eventually loses to a Republican over Medicare for all, healthcare will become a toxic issue in the democratic party, nobody will want to touch it with a 10 foot poll because everyone will know it was the issue that tore down Bernie's presidency, not only are Bernie's proposals useless by your own admission, but they will probably be actively damaging to the cause of better public healthcare in the long run.
Yep, sounds exactly like /r/technology, genuinely one of the most garbage subs in the entire site right alongside /r/politics 😂
>So you've admitted that Bernie's plan to eliminate private healthcare is not consistent with the systems of other countries   I think you need to read what I said again. Most other countries killed their old private health insurance systems when switching. A new system of private insurances as supplemental were created in most cases.   >and you've admitted that his plan won't pass congress yet you still support it.  Becuase it's the right policy. It's not about "sending a message". Every time we cave the Republicans slow down real progress and more people die in medical debt or are too scared to get help from hospitals. It doesnt matter to the Republicans what we pass. The ACA was invented by a conservative think tank and conservatives STILL lost their minds and threw a fit calling it "socialism". Meanwhile taking small baby steps does nothing but undercut what we ACTUALLY need. We could of had a real plan almost 12 years ago, but Obama caved. There is no remote possibly were the GoP wont revolt regardless of whether its Bidens moderate plan or Bernies progressive plan. You argue that pushing M4A now damages it, yet I argue that caving in to brain washed conservatives damages us more. We had everything we needed when Obama was in office yet they didnt do what was needed and here we are over a decade later no closer to actually affordable healthcare. People need to wake up and vote for the better policies, period.  I will not vote against the clearly better option. I think you even know that it is the better option becuase the whole argument you make is that it's less likely to pass. You cant argue Bidens plan is better, becuase it's not. Any attempt to convince me to vote against what is clearly a better plan will not work.  I never said that his proposals are useless. Do not put words in my mouth.
A new comprehensive system of private insurances that would not be present in Bernie's plan, again, Bernie's proposal is not consistent with the approach taken by other nations, period.  If you want to do what other countries are doing then maybe take a look at how they did it, none of these countries started with no public healthcare and switched to their current system in four years, it took them decades of continuous reforms and political battles to evolve and refine their systems into what they have today and as much as you might not like it, the same is going to have to be true of the US. You say you would never vote against a better option but you also admit that Bernie's plan won't pass, so explain to me how it is that literally nothing is a better option than a Biden plan that stands a chance of passing. The Government giving everyone a billion dollars each is clearly a better option than spending less money providing social services, that doesn't make it realistic.  At the end of the day if you'd rather vote to send a message rather than a real reform then so be it, but just know that the Americans who are really struggling won't be out there with you, something that has become abundantly clear today out of all days.
>A new comprehensive system of private insurances that would not be present in Bernie's plan, again, Bernie's proposal is not consistent with the approach taken by other nations, period.  You dont need to spell out the plans for private insurances. Bernies M4A plan states that private insurances are not allowed to duplicate what M4A would cover. They are given mostly free reign to cover things that wouldnt be by M4A. Private insurances would be acting as supplemental insurances like what many other countries do. I encourage you to read the bill.  >You say you would never vote against a better option but you also admit that Bernie's plan won't pass,  Right just like how I would never have voted against gay marriage, unlike Biden. There are right policies and then there are wrong policies. Passing Bidens will take the steam out of actually good policies that need to be passed.  > but just know that the Americans who are really struggling won't be out there with you, something that has become abundantly clear today out of all days.  That is rather offensive. Do you honestly think that every single one of the countless people that voted yesterday for Bernie were "well off"? You dont think any of them struggled? You think that your side is the only one that struggled? Bernies whole campaign is built out of grass roots and small donations from average Americans. Bidens campaign is built on rich donors and being Obama's VP. I'm sure that many of Biden's supporters do struggle though, but you seem to think that nobody could possible disagree with you and vote for an objectively better plan while still struggling.   >The Government giving everyone a billion dollars each is clearly a better option than spending less money providing social services, that doesn't make it realistic  That's not a better option at all. That would leave the government in crippling debt and has not been prove to work in any country unlike what Bernies M4A is built on....
Cory Booker endorses Joe Biden
A monster endorsement like this will SURELY be the top post of /r/politics. Right, guys?
And the coalition grows!!!
Hoping Biden can build on and continue getting those endorsements. Really positive week
\*Looks at thumbnail\*  Man, Cory Booker looks different than I remember.
Car is getting bigger!  Going to need a bus!
I think they are on their 15th Jesse Jackson news story at this point

Lol.   That sub is Bernie Central.   I almost can’t look at it at the moment.
They’re still coming down from Beto’s former bandmate
He’s had some work done.
Oh shit. Good point.
that's the worst take that's ever been taken
Oof
No you should.   &#x200B;  That way you get to compare between the circlejerking peak before a voting day, and then the utter cockblocking of the circlejerking after the pro-Biden results come in lol. Super Tuesday was the most prominent example; even after Biden won majority of the states, all you saw were pro-Bernie wins and circlejerks.  &#x200B;  And then when reality sunk in about 2-3 days later after Bloomberg also endorsed Biden, that's when most Bernie bros took a temporary nap off the sub to cool off their meltdown lol.  &#x200B;  Now they are back up at full force again; but watch out for after tomorrow's results. Then on March 17 as well; as it would dawn on them that their massive echo chamber is just.... a puny chamber compared to the vast majority of Americans who don't want the country swinging like a mad pendulum from one end of a political spectrum to another.
I actually use this sub as my only source of aggregated news on all things Diamond Joe. It should not be called "politics."
It’s become what /r/T___D became essentially.  And is also similarly a Russian influenced echo chamber. Toxicity at its absolute finest.
He's no fool.  He knows how hard it is for Americans to trust a black man.
I only use /politics to keep up with what Trump and Congress are doing.  I mostly ignore a lot of the primary stuff.
Don't know why something so spot on got so downvoted.  &#x200B;  You would be correct. OP is also correct in calling it a horseshoe. It's exactly what we are having put in front of us, and for the life of me I cannot understand why the generally good people of that sub and everywhere else are taking the Bernie bait.  &#x200B;  Populist vs Populist ends in a massive electoral win for Trump. His tweets supporting Bernie should tell everyone everything they need to know.
The shmucks also think that just because Comrade Sanders is popular in their little echo chamber, that it translates across the country.  Which , as Super Tuesday clearly showed, it doesn’t.  The issue is they have all been shouting “Vote Blue No Matter Who” in an attempt to convince People to vote for Bernie when he inevitably would win the nomination... However now, the rhetoric has become “I can’t vote for Biden or anyone that isn’t Bernie”  It’s pathetic and divisive. Bernie’s new crusade against “the establishment” and his conspiracy theory laden interview yesterday morning is the exact same message as DJT’s rally to his supporters to “drain the swamp”
It's the Soviet way!!

Joe speaking graciously about Pete   This is a good night   Something clicked in Joe down in the dirty south, he found his voice. I like this Joe, connecting with people and being humble.
Now Bernie Bros are claiming that we're trying to screw Bernie out of the nomination again. How does unifying behind one moderate candidate screw Bernie out of a nomination?
Joe is easy to fall back in love with. He wasn’t my first choice but he is the one I’ll be voting for.
Beto taking Joe and Jill to Whataburger!!! Lmao!!
Folks! This is a team! We need your help!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  I'm going for Whatburger right now!
We'll it was awesome to see the love and support from several different Reddit campaign subs in here coming together as one party!! I'm feeling the love and unity in here!
I havent felt this much energy since april 14th when buttigieg declared.
Team Pete now Team Joe and just made my first donation to Joe. Let's win this thing!
Biden breathing life into the party's soul.
Donald Trump, you're fired!
I’m just pinching myself.  Who could have predicted this outcome before Saturday?  I was just hoping for a nice win and now Amy and Pete are stumping for Joe!  JOEMENTUM!!!
Good god Beto is talented. I wonder how far he'd have gone without the "I'm coming for your guns".
Supporter of Pete since he started his exploratory committee over a year ago. Will always be a Buttigieg supporter and will support Biden in this race going forward.  I Just got home from the Dallas event. Here are some impressions:  -It was packed. The venue held around 3500 people. When my wife and I got there there were easily 3,000+ in line. Over the next hour the line probably grew by another 2k people or more. We were one of the last ones let in and there were easily 1500+ people still outside.   -Everyone in line was super nice and excited. Honestly, at least in our section of the line, there were TONS of Buttigieg supporters. There were lots of Pete shirts and signs in the crowd. Pete’s endorsement definitely made an impact on the turnout at the rally.  -The event itself was really energetic. Amy got a good reaction and you could tell she was emotional and everyone was supportive of her.   -Joe was the best I’ve seen him. He was energized. He is obviously feeding off the energy of the endorsements. I was impressed with him. It definitely felt like this was the start of something special.  -Joe needs to employ Beto as official campaign hype man.   -Overall, really great energy and there was a sense in the crowd that we’re going to make this happen. The fact that you had supporters from all these other candidates show up to one location, be super friendly with each other, and move their support to a different candidate was really something to witness.   -On the way out  there were two Bernie supporters holding giant signs and screaming at people that they’re throwing their vote away. It was a very stark contrast to the positivity and belonging that was shared inside the event. Was interesting to witness. Couldn’t help but wonder if they are unaware they are doing more harm than good of if they are aware and are doing it because of some internal anger and desire for confrontation.   -After we passed the Bernie supporters we found ourselves walking next to a mother and her little son. The little guy was wearing a Pete shirt. He was clearly bummed that Pete wasn’t at the event. (I think many of us shared his disappointment) But his mother was explaining to him that Pete was going to work with Joe. It was heart warming. So thanks little dude for making us smile.
Damn, I forgot how good of a speaker Beto is
I wonder if Beto missed giving these ELECTRIC speeches
Joe’s the grandpa we need.
Is Kamala coming 🤞🤞🤞
Will Beto be on stage, or his he just endorsing?  Either way, awesome!
Holy crap. I love this positive energy that the moderate democrat base is building. All good vibes, it's all love! We have to unite not point fingers.
this is fucking epic. If Pete was here too I would literally die
Avengers, assemble
"We have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party, but we cannot become like them."
I missed Beto. Great Joe speech!
When you're not the headliner at your own rally. Goodness I miss Beto. Can't wait to get to vote for him again if he decides to run for office here in Texas.
Beto is just electric.
Whataburger is on the menu folks!
Former Pete voter here to join the growing list of those endorsing Diamond Joe Biden for President! It is time for America to choose a path of minimal malarkey!
THANK YOU AMY, PETE, AND BETO!!!!
Damn this is a great speech. He's so right on endorsements, we've got so many big endorsements.
Today has been a vindication 9 years in the making for me. I’ve loved Biden since probably 2011, and having all this warmth, support, surging polls ... it’s been a long time coming and I am so unbelievably proud. I don’t know what tomorrow will bring, but these last 48 hours have full of pride and humility.   This is what I’ve known Biden to be about, and it’s been nothing short of cathartic after these last 5 years.
I've watched almost every Joe's campaign from Iowa until now.   I am 100%  certain this is probably his best campaign speech so far.
Betos endorsement should bring him over the top in Texas
That was a beautiful endorsement
That was incredible. The energy here is beautiful. So much positivity all around and respect and decency :'-)
God I love Beto so much
I wish Beto wouldn’t have gone for broke and made those comments on guns, because now he’s radioactive in Texas.   He should be running against Cornyn now.
Sources: Sanders is beside himself. Driving around downtown Dallas begging (thru texts) O'Rourke's family for address to Beto's home
Maybe I'm crazy, but I feel like Amy has pretty good delivery. Whoever writes her stump speech needs to be fired though.
Beto!!! Damn Joe's had some great speeches of late!
WHATABURGER BAby!!!
We got Joe, Amy, Pete, and Beto. Just need one more to form the megazord. Could it be Kamala?
This is going to be a tremendous moment!
Is Beto coming on board tonight too?  Texas is where it’s at
And Beto O'Rourke!!!
Amy is kind of building a strong case for VP right now.  Kamala Harris is probably looking at how quickly she can get a flight to Texas.
Everyone yelling Amy. Really nice ❤️
I tried to get in to the rally tonight, but they were at capacity. I did get to meet this [very enthusiastic Biden campaign volunteer ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ViZsge1)  (center) though, so not a total waste of an evening. Also really nice to see first hand that Biden supporters are revitalized after tonight. I don’t think they were expecting the crowd that showed up.
[deleted]
Moore insulting black voters from SC. Typical from bernie camp..insult and hate
where is BETO!
Joe was never there for the rich and the powerful. He was always there for the average american!
B E T O
I still am unclear what being apart of the establishment means? I'm a Missouri Democrat, what establishemnt?!?
IT’S ALL COMING TOGETHER BABY 💎🐊
Uh, they should get better lighting on that stage
I just tuned into the PBS Newshour stream which is really a nice clear stream. I think because Pete already endorsed publicly, the rally will have Klobuchar and O’Rourke endorsements.
We've got bad weather tonight, tornado levels. Might be off and on.
Joe is really speaking from the heart right now
So is the plan of online Sanders supporters to just be awful to Elizabeth Warren until she drops out?  That's a surefire way to ensure her supporters just love you when she finally does.    No way they'd take one look at the other mixed group of supporters from other candidates all getting along and say, hey that looks a lot nicer than those snake emoji people.
Almost 5k!!! We're doing it!!!
5,012!!! We did it!
Silly question. I just read that Pete already endorsed and won't be at the rally. Is that true?
hahah the sound quality is pure public access TV right now !
C-SPAN updated the title of their stream to: Joe Biden in Dallas with Senator Amy Klobuchar
Was that dude white balancing cameras with a sheet of paper from across the venue? lol
I supported Clinton in 2016. Now I'm ready for Joe! It's time to bring back decency to the Oval Office!
This speech is incredible. There's no way we lose TX tomorrow, how could anyone turn their backs on such an inclusive and beautiful message?
BETO!!!!!!
omg!
OH SHIT HE HAS ENTERED THE BUILDING BABY!
I like going 2 r/politics and watching them asking for Warren 2 drop out AND then reading at the bottom of the free is several pages of how much they hate her.
WE KNOW JOE
I think this is going to be one of Joe's more memorable speeches
From one of the other mods:  A Beto road warrior is behind Biden right now.
Guy in the crowd: We love you Joe!
I finally listened to Joe’s speech from Saturday. The pain that man carries around every day, the courage and grit he’s shown to push through it, the empathy he’s capable of displaying at all times, he’s such an inspiration.
The stream has not started yet.  The event begins at 7:30 pm CT/8:30pm ET.  Alternate stream:  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20X2yYVEGII
WHOO HOOOOOooooo!!! And I heard Beto will be there to endorse also. Cozy night before Super Tuesday.
Here's a working link i believe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVFZ4\_g\_6GU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVFZ4_g_6GU)
Where is Kamala Harris ?  She needs to make a surprise appearance in Texas!
So are Pete and Beto coming out tonight at this rally? I know Pete already gave a speech tonight somewhere else
WHERE IS whataburger Beto!
There goes Trump... lmfao
LETS GOOOOOO
We keep getting the emergency alert system! Lol! Hard to watch this thing.
Anyone know what the reason is for the delay?

This is my mood tonight: https://i.redd.it/9i9sgkxkts0y.png

This is awesome.
Will this be televised or only youtube? CNN is going to have interviews...
Has it started?  I'm still staring at a Youtube placeholder screen.
Here we go!!
Anyone know of a link to the whole rally? I wasn't able to watch, got back right at the end!
Anybody heard from Kamala? I was really hoping she’d get in on all this
Chris Hayes is taking Mike Bloomberg 2 task!!! Damn!!!

Today was a great day for Biden and the campaign, but California is the big prize tomorrow and it’s not looking good for Joe there.
Joe Biden Wins Endorsement Of Machinists Union After Rare Rank-And-File Vote: "Biden won 36% of the vote versus 26% for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Donald Trump took 34% of ballots cast."
Yet another reason why Biden must be the nominee.  Bernie loses even union members to Trump.
For anyone else who was wondering, it looks like they'll have a separate vote later for the general election:  > The new process will require multiple steps, beginning with members voting online for a candidate in either the Republican or Democratic primary. Leaders of the union’s political arms in each state will then weigh in based on the members’ picks. After Super Tuesday, the union will make an endorsement in both primaries with the blessing of the national executive council.  > After both parties have nominated a candidate, delegates to the union’s convention will vote on a general election endorsement in September 2020.  > It's all but a forgone conclusion that the union will ultimately endorse the Democratic nominee, but Martinez said the executive council won't likely intervene if members decide to endorse President Donald Trump.  https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/06/machinists-union-endorsement-2020-1411338

Berners like to say that when the union members get to vote they'll vote Bernard. Well they did and they did not pick Bernard.
Ahh I love democracy.
They know Trump is the guy that stiffs his workers and moves jobs overseas for his crappy ties, right?
This issue leaves me conflicted. I'm an adjunct professor with a union, and they are horribly ineffective. I have to fight the union to get then to fight for and I suspect it's cost me my job.  I think we need to let unions compete just like every other service provider. I believe in freedom of association and collective bargaining, but a lot of policies to "strengthen" unions strengths them against the employees who might want to replace them.  So more directly relevant to OP, just to get a vote in my union I have to join and give a bigger piece of my (tiny) paycheck. As a fee payer, my fee cannot by law go towards political activities, but of I want to have just a vote in the union, I have to fund political activity I might not agree with.
Strange that this endorsement, like virtually all Biden endorsements, is buried in arr politics.
!arweavethis
Bernie has morphed his message from, "I have your back" to "you won't need the union with me".  Its a conflicting message for groups that operate inside of a market economy.
Misleading take. Presumably the Democrats would coalesce together if there was only one of them against Trump.
 💎 💎 💎 💎 💎
I will give you that not all unions are created equal.  My dad was a United Steelworker and was very, very active in his union.  His union fought tooth and nail for their members.  My dad's employer had contract negotiations every two years and it was always a huge fight between the union and the employer.  The employer always wanted to cut health benefits, cut pensions, get rid of holiday pay, etc.  And they were never able to do that because of the union.  The union was also incredible when my dad was diagnosed with cancer.  They collected money for him every week and brought it to us.  They fought his employer to make an exception and allow me to inherit his pension when he died and they won.
Also, most unions have a separate optional fee for political activities.
That's right out of the left authoritarian handbook.  How terrifying.
There is a reason he doesn't have union backing.
I can see how it would be easy to slide that way when you view the world as completely broken and unjust.  You dream up the ideals on how things should be and totally discount the limitations of humanity. Big companies fall into this trap too, they start thinking, we did this, so therefore we can do anything and everything.
Clean sweep of every county in Missouri
Another malarkey free zone
Mississippi will too join #EveryCountyGang too.  [Michigan might too.](https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1237576640990834688)
Moving to Kansas City to canvass for Joe in August  Edit: The one in Missouri, not the one in Kansas like Trump thinks.
that's a good look, man, I like that look
MISSOURI!!! Represent.  This is the state you need to show people when they ask about it Joe can switch seats.
Go to Joe.
wow this makes me happy
***HIGHER AND HIGHER***
One November repeat please. I love my state but it’s hard to like it sometimes.
Tonight was a bittersweet night for me. Not because of Joe, but to see how many voters didn't like Hillary in 2016 and voted against her. She was a terrible candidate, but would have made an amazing President.
[deleted]
Its such a powerful message being sent. This landslide look. Renews faith for a country that has being beat up by the treachery in the WH and the SENATE. I sincerely hope the country and the world are watching now. UNITED we stand. Our country will get through this, the right way.
Probably because Missouri is one of those states that people forget exists
Michigan has as well.  That makes it 6 states where Biden won every county (Oklahoma, Alabama and South Carolina as well)  2 more states (Arkansas and Virginia) Biden won all but one county.
Well thanks for being the team player!!! We need boots on the ground in every state.
Marion county checking in, did my part this morning.
She wasn’t really a terrible candidate. She had the misfortune of being a woman. A whole bunch of sexist crap got hung on her, and we as a country got fucked in the process. Hopefully Joe can help unfuck it.
That’s in Mississippi. This is Missouri
Do you have nothing better to do this morning, my dude?
My favorite city!

ITS LATE AND I SHOULD BE IN BED BY NOW
Welcome, Elizabeth Warren supporters!
Once again: **We do not tolerate any of our users harassing others.** If you see someone doing that, please message the mods.
Don't go to their sub, guys. Let them come here if they want to. Give them space.
Warren people, I send love from Team Pete! It's always so hard when this happens. Warren is a fantastic politician and I have so, so much respect for the Senate work she's done.  I can vouch that this team is very welcoming. There will always be room for Team Warren here 💜
Believe it or not, as a Warren supporter, the story of Hervis Rogers is motivating me to vote for Biden out of respect for that man.
Thanks for the welcome! I am excited to help Joe clinch the nomination!  &#x200B;  Edit: Wow I'm already loving it here.  Great job with all the inclusive flairs!
I'm here now.  As a Warren progressive I think I need a better steward of the cause than Bernie.  And someone who can actually win. I'm probably a bit more left than most here, but I see the data and the overwhelming theme of this cycle "Beat Trump." I believe with the coalition that Biden has, he has the best chance to do it.    I also like the tone and messaging of this camp a ton more than ritualistic sacrifice of anyone who might disagree with you.   May we return to a place of thoughtful discourse.  Even if the step isn't as far left as I might have wanted at the beginning, it's a step in the right direction.
Thanks, what does the Biden campaign need in terms of volunteering right now? I feel suddenly useless now that Warren is out 😢
To all those suggesting Liz for VP or cabinet -- Biden supporters love Elizabeth, and the country would be lucky to have her in a key role! But let's not forget how important it is to have brilliant senators in important positions to legislate. When we flip the Senate, she could lead Banking, Housing, and Urban affairs or Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Those are going to be the roles that actually write and debate most of the legislation needed to make progress, and they are arguably more important than many cabinet posts.
Another Warren-to-Biden convert checking in. Even though I’ve been able to see the writing on the wall for a while, I was still pretty devastated by today’s announcement.  BUT, this election is too important to wallow.  I appreciate how friendly and welcoming this sub is.  It takes a little bit of the sting out of having to find a new political home.  And I really believe in the coalition-building style of politics, so I’m glad to be joining a campaign that believes in it too.  Truthfully, I’m not exactly excited to vote for Joe in the primary, but I’m hoping I’ll come to believe in him the way I believed in Liz.
Hi all, I'm a heartbroken Warren progressive ready to throw my lot in with Joe Biden. My state votes on the 10th, so the ballot I was saving for her will now go to him. I take it malarkey isn't allowed here...?
[deleted]
Thank you!. I was soarin' with Warren, now I'm ridin' with Biden.
Voted for Liz in Oklahoma on Tuesday. I was torn between her and Joe, but I decided I wanted the election to show there is a place for her and her ideas that isn't with Bernie.   Thank you all for being so welcoming. The attitudes of the Joe people and the Pete people have made it a really easy transition. I think my view of Joe was heavily skewed before, and now that I have taken the time to look at him I would be thrilled to vote for him in November.
Bernie supporters yesterday: “Drop out you lying Pocahontas!”  Bernie supporters today: “Come to our side and let’s unite!”
I fell hard for Elizabeth Warren, and I'm sad that she's out.  However, as someone who started getting interested in politics in the early/mid 2010s, I've always had a soft spot for Joe.  Even though Bernie might be closer to me ideologically, I know that Joe a good and decent man, and I think his experience and record shows that he will be more effective in getting some of the policies that Warren fought for.  Also, I rewatched his 2016 DNC speech. "America is second to none. We own the finish line!"  I'm ready for someone who's proud to be an American, and makes me proud to be American, to be back in the oval office. Even if he's not Elizabeth Warren, damn, Joe Biden makes me feel good about America.  Also, i'm a sucker for the memes.  Warning, I wasn't able to vote for Obama in 2012 cuz of my age, and I've never voted for a winning candidate, mayoral/gubernatoral/presidential (even in primaries). Hopefully, Joe ends this streak
I remember the first time I heard Warren speak was a CNN town hall probably about a year ago now. First she spoke, then maybe Amy K, then Bernie.  I couldn't get over how Warren (approx 3% in the polls at that point) was so much better than Bernie. She was lucid, engaged, quick witted, knew her stuff- it was incredible. Also the way she dealt with Bloomberg was fantastic. I was surprised she did not get more of a boost from that encounter (probably only due to the primary states order).  The combination of a personal hero of mine in Joe Biden running and Warren's policies being a step too far to the left for me meant that I never truly supported her, but she is a phenomenal politician. I kinda think she should get a cabinet role and be allowed to run a department rather than having to be just one face in 100 in the Senate.
Heartbroken Warren supporter. She would have been the best president in terms of policy. I guess I'll reluctantly support Biden now because he's the only candidate of the remaining two with a record of legislative accomplishments.
There are a lot of great things about Warren. I’ve always liked her. Welcome aboard!
This is a malarkey free zone.  All are welcome.
First, I want to thank your mod team for the post in this sub about not being dicks to Warren supporters over the last few days.  Very Classy.  I am a single issue voter.  Its not guns, its not abortions, its not M4A/Public option.  It's anti-corruption.  Probably not a surprise to you that I was a Warren supporter.    Now more than ever we need a President who will not prove to be Carter 2.0, We need someone who will do more than create milquetoast reforms after an extraordinarily corrupt President.  Someone who will not hand the White House to a Republican in 2024.  I've looked around Joe's website and maybe I wasn't thorough enough, but what is his anticorruption plan?  How will he work to stop lobbyists such as the NRA from purchasing legislative votes?  How will he ensure that no child or close relative of a President or VP is ever involved in a clear conflict of interest?  What is his plan to make sure that our elections are free and fair so we never have someone like Trump again?  Thank you in advance and apologies if I've missed something obvious on his platform.
I'm in my feels today. I joined this sub a couple days ago because I knew it was coming after Super Tuesday.   I've always supported Warren, when she began running against incumbent Republican for Senate in 2012.   It makes me sad how much crap she got from a certain progressive candidate and his supporters. I think what people don't realize is she's not a politician, she didn't get into this realm really until 2012.   She is brilliant and cares so much about the American people. I know her and Biden are very different and have very different views. But I was really touched by his tweet about her. That's the thing. Biden is presidential, has morals and can be an amazing president.   I'll probably be bummed for Warren for awhile but this Warren supporter is now supporting Joe Biden.
Was a little down today since she dropped out. *BUT* it's not time to give up, and while I emotionally want progressive AF policies, I am a pragmatic voter. I live on the west coast so there's plenty of Bernie Bros around me. My worry is they'll sit out and not vote in November because iTs nOt tHEIr pErFeCT cAnDiDaTe. Mind you, we live in a vote-by-mail state.
Welcome! It's hard. Take your time. Grieve how you need. Many of us have been there.   We're excited to have you. Some cultural things to welcome you... this sub adopted Pete's rules of the road. The mods are great. Malarkey is bad and we will have none of it. Diamonds are a big thing here. And ice cream. Its awesome for grieving and celebrating. Symone Sanders is the badass that tackled the protester. I'm still learning the other staffers. Flair is welcome, it's in the community options.  Feel free to tell us about any cultural/community things that are Team Warren, so we can be inclusive.
As a old DFLer and a Wellstone Minnesotan I love Warren and her supporters.   Lets get shit done!
All are welcome! If you’re a Warren supporter who is now voting for Bernie you’re still welcome here. Let’s keep this positive train flowing.
I just want to say, the thought of the impact the amazing Warren staffers, supporters, and BAILEY would have on the Biden campaign (*should they choose to support him*) is pretty exciting. The Pete, Amy, Beto, etc. supporters brought incredible energy and organization to help out on ST and have been a true delight.  And IMO Pete and Warren's team need to be put in charge of the digital/social media effort yesterday. They were really in a class of their own.
Lots of us also know the grieving process you guys are going through, having started out as supporters of other candidates. Be good to yourselves today. It was a great campaign.
I loved Warren and Pete because I wanted an energetic and brilliant president.  Now, between Bernie and Biden, it's a no-brainer.  Bernie will tear this country apart.  Hopefully Biden can beat Trump and gain us the Senate, and we'll try this whole primary thing again in four years.
Rachel Maddow interviewing Senator Warren on msnbc right now. Well ... in a few moments.
Welcome.  Thank you for choosing country over candidate.  Together, let's beat Trump.
I wanted to share what I've always loved about Warren (I was an early voter in CA for Pete, and now wholeheartedly support Joe btw.)  I've been a Warren fan for years. Her fiercely passionate pursuit of what is just captured my heart.   Her anti-corruption message and history of fighting corruption is, in my opinion, exactly what this country needs. The way she fights for the little guy is why she was my number 1 choice for a long time. Early on in 2019, I remember seeing an interview with a former Trump supporter whose number 1 concern was that the president fight the opioid epidemic, because his son was one of the victims. Once he realized that all of his messaging was just a lie, he said that he would be supporting Warren, because he believed that she would be the best one to fight for his son.  Theres a lot of truth to that, given that SNL always portrayed her as a "nevertheless, she persisted" fighter. (I got my mom a mug that says that, with the statue of Liberty in the background. It's her favorite morning coffee mug now.)  I remember wanting her to be on the ticket in 2016, and being thrilled that she was running in 2020. A woman president would be an incredible, welcomed change. And I can see how she's already inspired SO many girls to be leaders, just in the famous selfie line (this video comes to mind: https://youtu.be/VUNAwQ8elmk)  And my goodness, she has the acute sense of policy detail AND the great ability to make it understandable (which, as a teacher, I greatly admire! I'm also the child of a teacher, so her personal story truly resonated with me). I loved how refreshing it was for someone to "have a plan for that."   I went through the grieving process when Buttigieg dropped out. I can only imagine what it was like to hear the news today. So, to the Warren supporters: I see you, hear you, and I empathize with you so, so much.
Glad to be here. Glad to be all in on the Diamond now. Thanks for the welcome.   Let’s take back the White House in November.
[#WarrenToBiden is trending on Twitter! But subtweets are filled with Berniebros unfortunately](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WarrenToBiden?src=hashtag_click)
Can someone help me understand why you are supporting Biden? This isn’t me trying to argue, I just truly want to know what policies you are behind. I voted for Warren on Tuesday, but Bernie was my second (I don’t even like saying second, I had a tough time choosing between the two) choice. I feel like I should have voted for him bc Medicare for all is my main concern for this election. I’m just looking for some opinions and dialogue on what I view as a more centrist candidate. I don’t feel like things will really change if Biden is elected. But I would love to hear people out.

Greetings and Welcome 2 all Warren's people!
Can anyone explain briefly on Biden's appeal to me? Guy seems to have dementia and his policies go the Hillary 2016 route, basically a nudge on the status quo. I'm a Warren or Sanders guy.
**↑** This. **↑**
Seconded.  Team Pete went through the same thing last week, and we know how it feels. Give them some space to grieve. Bombarding them doesn't help.
What a patriot! It definitely reminded me of how important it is for all of us to vote. If he could do it and be late for work then we can do it too
such a cool story.
Don't forget our official emoji combo! 😎🍦
I think Biden's policy is a lot more progressive than most realize. His platform gets gaslight really hard by Bernie supporters saying "He doesn't want to change anything," etc.
>I also like the tone and messaging of this camp a ton more than ritualistic sacrifice of anyone who might disagree with you.   We even accept future former Republicans and single dem vote Republicans. We all need to do our part in 2020 to win our country back.      We can all unite on the fact that we want a functional government, de-politisize our State and Justice dept, and allie with democratic nations over dictatorships.
I still don't understand the idea that Bernie can't win. Biden polls better against Trump then Bernie does but not by much, and Biden's debating skills have fallen off more then a little since 2008 and 2012, and he's very gaffe-prone, something that Trump is very good at exploiting. Not to mention Sanders does better against Trump in the Rust belt overall as well as my own home state of Texas, two areas that could single handedly decide the election.

thanks for joining!
Don’t feel useless. A lot of us here came from Pete and Amy. This is a great community. Text or phone bank when you’re ready!
I’m a field organizer here in Jacksonville Florida! Message me if you’d like and we can set up a phone bank for you to call into the state. Of course, if you’re from a state that hasn’t voted yet I’m happy to connect you to a local staff member!
> Thanks, what does the Biden campaign need in terms of volunteering right now?   I think just about everything, he has basically no organization anywhere. It's the first campaign I can think of built mostly by including other supporters (which is a good thing to me).
Your not useless. Yes your candidate is no.longer in the rsce but your vote and support for joe can see her ideas still come to life. We are all in this together. And no ones vote is useless. Thats bernie bro talk.

thank you and welcome aboard!  (it's not Biden supporters downvoting you by the way)
No Malarky and follow the ROTR
Welcome, a lot of us Pete supporters are here, the Biden camp has been extremely welcoming.       I know we've kept our sub up, and I would assume you will as well. I know it's helped a lot of us to still have that space.       The world has the UN, we have the coalition of decency, welcome aboard.
May I ask why Biden, and not Sanders?
Of course! This is a good thing to say (although hopefully it shouldn't be necessary). Unlike other candidates' supporters, we make no demands.
>Voted for Liz in Oklahoma on Tuesday. I was torn between her and Joe, but I decided I wanted the election to show there is a place for her and her ideas that isn't with Bernie.   Holy shit. Are you me?!  I was all in on Pete so quickly had to decide who my next choice was to vote for. You basically summed up my decision-making right down to the voting in Oklahoma, LOL
This so much. I supported Bernie in 2016. The Bernie Bros pushed a lot of voters away like me who were against the name-calling and general toxicity. When we warned that they were losing the Black vote & other voters, they got angry, basically told us too bad or denied there was any problem outright.   So I went with Warren this time and saw the Bros use racist language about Pocahontas, just like Trump did and refer to Black people as uneducated, blaming them for Bernie's primary losses.   Bernie can't control his bros while Biden supporters have been diligently working together without tearing each other down and we saw the results of those differences on Super Tuesday.
That was all over my Facebook
As someone who leans left of Biden as a Pete supporter, I take a lot of solace that it's extremely unlikely that Joe would stop any progressive legislation passed by the house and Senate.       I truly believe our country will be more progressive under Biden than Bernie as odd as that sounds. This type of coalition can win seats, not just the presidency.
I won't be proud to be an American under any presidency until we stop allowing the working class to be exploited and catch up to the rest of the world. I support Bernie because he's consistent, inspiring, and I can be confident more than anyone else he'll fight for the everyman, given his insistence to refuse money from billionaires and super PACs (I don't personally consider Our Revolution a PAC since it's grass movement but I understand the criticism)
I volunteered holding signs for her that day and got to shake her hand. There was a couple hundred of us and she shook all our hands to thank us, even though her driver (?someone, not sure) was in a rush to get going for the town hall. It sounds cheesy to say but it was a wonderful moment for me.  I really hope ranked choice voting takes off, so that people like you don't have to pick sides.
I'm also not overjoyed to support Biden after liking Pete, but the primary contest shows that Joe is the only one who can win all across the country and unite the party in doing so. I believe the coalition that's growing now is rock solid and it can beat Trump if we hold on to that unity.
This is actually a great, fair question I haven't heard before. I'll try to give you an answer later but it goes without saying that he'd clean house from Trump-appointed partisan scum hacks and replace them with good progressives. Since he's been in the political realm for so long and has 4 years of White House experience, this might be one of his biggest strengths.
 I think this page will have much of what you're looking for!  https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/
Hey and welcome! This is a great question given that it’s Warren’s hallmark and hasn’t been something Biden has necessarily emphasized enough on the campaign trail.  This might be what you’re looking for, his policies on structural government reform:  https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
https://joebiden.com/governmentreform/  Is where I'd start I guess, it's a good question though.
"Corruption is a cancer: a cancer that eats away at a citizen's faith in democracy, diminishes the instinct for innovation and creativity; already-tight national budgets, crowding out important national investments. It wastes the talent of entire generations. It scares away investments and jobs." --joe biden, May 21,2014 Romania  " Fighting corruption is not just good governance. It's self-defense. It's patriotism." Nov 2014  Long before Trump announced his run for President, Biden was talking about corruption in government.
Oh hell, even a week later, and I was naturally going to link you to Pete's policies... :(
Corruption touches on a lot of individual subjects (heck, it effects everything) that most campaigns address individually. I think Warren is unique in focusing on corruption in specific, whereas with other candidates, you have to look at corruption related proposals in their other plans. For example, in his plan for criminal justice reform, Biden talks about wanting the DOJ to be committed to investigating corruption and malpractice at the police and prosecutor level.
Also in addition to his existing plans, I'd imagine that staffers and new supporters from migrating campaigns will start to enhance/promote complements to Biden's existing platforms over the next few weeks too.
thank you! I have a lot of respect for Warren, and it must have been awful news today.
I do think Joe needs to work on reaching out to the Bernie supporters to a point they at least feel HERD. Their issues are very important to them and warrant thoughtful discourse.      But the Bernie or bust numbers aren't nearly as great as the combination of the centerest Republican Joe will get, plus the Republican non voters that would rally against Bernie.
Indeed—welcome! Let’s talk either way.
Yes. The fact that joe has said he only wants one term is a huge plus for me
Bernie is a populist, as are his policies. He's the most favorable senator in Washington and he appeals to young people better than anyone else. He is an above average debator. Both Biden and Bernie will very likely beat Trump, but given Biden's gaffes and lack luster debate performances lead me to believe Bernie has a better chance.
Let's save America!
What does the polling numbers say about who has the best chance against Trumo now?
And the rest in 2022!
It's like those supporters are allergic to unity.
Personally, I am a single-issue 'defeat Trump' voter (for many reasons, most importantly Supreme Court appointments; two more Trump nominees means literally 30 years of zero progressive laws ever being upheld) and the data--simple data like the RCP general election polling average and the 2018 election results--suggests to me that both Biden in particular and moderates generally are the best choice for this purpose.  The notion that ideologically pure candidates win "purple" general elections by driving voter turnout has been proven blatantly false time and time again, for both Rs and Ds.  To me the difference between Joe and Bernie is so astronomically tiny compared to the difference between either of them and Trump that the policy differences are really not that relevant to me, given that any sweeping legislative change will be blocked by the Senate or current Supreme Court anyway.  (I am personally of the opinion that, optimally, the government should be completely in charge of healthcare, but also of the very strong opinion that such a system is literally *impossible* to enact given the country's current politics, so it's more important to have a better chance at movement in the right direction).
I chose Biden because I think that there is more to being president than what Bernie can offer. I respect Bernies views on MFA but we need someone who can offer true leadership. We need someone who can work with congress and get things passed and we need someone who can restore America’s standing in the world and get our relationships with our allies back on track. What Joe said about this election being for the soul of America really resonated with me. I think we need a president that can deliver beyond policy and I think Joe Biden is the only one left that can do on that
His policies. Here is a good official overview: [Joe's Vision for America](https://joebiden.com/joes-vision/)  I think Barack Obama gave the most compelling description of Joe: [Who he is in 60 seconds](https://youtu.be/EcL_puLKQIE)
My policy reasons for supporting Biden are mostly because of foreign policy. The isolationist, anti-trade policies of Bernie aren't good, in my opinion, especially in a world where China and Russia are emerging as direct competitors to the US. We need a leader who is willing to work with other countries and I just don't think Bernie cares about the US on the world stage.  From a non-policy perspective, I'll echo what others have said about Biden's ability to work with people. A lot of Bernie people have complained about the "establishment" backing Biden. I don't think that's as much because of specific policies as it is because Biden is just more willing to work with other members of Congress to come to solutions than Bernie is/would be. I imagine that if Bernie would become president, Congress would send a lot of bills to his desk that he'd refuse to sign, even if the bills certainly progress things in the correct direction. Ultimately, the President's ability to enact policy on his own is limited to executive orders and much of foreign policy. I trust Biden to work with Congress, whether controlled by Republicans or Democrats, and I trust him much more on foreign policy.
Former Warren supporter here and I voted for her by mail the day of Nevada's primary. I've never been prouder to support a candidate for President.   I'm supporting Joe now because I'm hashtag bluenomatterwho. I also like Joe. I've [learned about his stutter](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/joe-biden-stutter-profile/602401/) and re-watched President Obama award him the Medal of Freedom.   Hot take: I feel like the primary campaign wrapped up on Monday. Joe and Bernie can only "get out the vote" at this point. Likely scenarios put Joe with a solid plurality of the votes. Unless something crazy happens
I want to take a different tack from other responses and say that one of the reasons I support Joe is why I love Warren: He is a fundamentally decent and resilient person who isn't afraid to be emotionally vulnerable. I support him for who he is, not just what he stands for.   After he talked about his faith and what it means to him in that CNN town hall I had to leave the room and cry a little bit. I have to every time he talks about Beau. You can see his face change when anyone describes loss or tragedy. He stops being Joe the candidate and becomes Joe the father who lost 3 of his kids far before their time. The man who only wants to live up to what his son asked of him on his deathbed: "Promise me, dad."  The strength and empathy that he has exhibits in the wake of so much personal tragedy is something I don't know I could love up to. But he gives me hope. Not just for the future of our country and what it means to have a good person in the White House, but what his strength means to other people.  Folks like Warren and Biden are the exact kind of people we need to restore the soul of this nation and I would have been so proud to vote forneither of them. I'm pretty annoyed that Warren was written off so unceremoniously, but she's not going away. She's such an inspiration.
I think the first thing we have to do to see any positive change is to get Trump out of the White House, and I think Joe is now the best positioned to do that.  I am also very disappointed by the toxicity and vitriol coming out of the Sanders campaign.  Congress is the one tasked with creating legislation, and I'm sure if a Medicare 4 All bill makes it out of Congress, Joe Biden would sign it. So let's get to work voting for progressives in the Senate/House.
I believe Bernie would actually take the country towards socialism. And I ain't talking about Medicare!  I'm talking about the Federal Jobs Guarantee, and giving 20% ownership and 45% control of all major corporations over to the employees.  A Sanders win would give a ton of momentum to the socialist movement, and as someone who believes in capitalism, I really don't want to see that. Assuming this is the last time Sanders runs, the socialists will be without a major figure to rally behind, and I think the whole thing will recede. I think Bernie's socialist supporters also believe that, and it's why they've become so toxic.
Simple. Bernie’s election would cause a civil war. The rights all out war on “socialism” is not just rhetoric. Talking with many trump supporters, a lot of them believe that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is the real enemy of America and that a split along ideological lines may be necessary. They view Bernie’s campaign as an assault on the constitution. I’m an independent. I don’t particularly like any of the candidates and an receptive to farther left ideas as there is a reason the rest of the developed world is too the left of us. However I also want what’s best for America and in this election cycle, we need someone who can heal and try to bring some bipartisanship back to America and Biden is capable of that while Bernie is not
First, you should know that Biden does want to have the government to provide a public option (subsidized if you're poor) and to continue reforming healthcare.   The most exciting thing to me about Biden is that he's really a team player. If you read his campaign website, you'll find that he's constantly elevating solutions proposed by other politicians. I think that this coalition building will be extremely effective, as it'll be less about Biden trying to shape what other people are doing, and more about giving them extra support. This gives the Democratic party a pretty good chance of getting an awful lot done during a Biden presidency.
Because Biden has a history of working collaboratively with others. Sanders does not. As a former Warren guy, the ability to build a successful coalition is absolutely key to uniting the Democrats. Everything I've seen with Sanders shows me he is incapable of doing that.
Biden doesn't have dementia. Joe has fully released his medical records and he has 0 neuro-cognitive disorders. Joe **has** struggled from a debilitating speech disorder since he was a child but mostly overcame it. [Here's an absolutely great article about his struggles.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/602401/)  Re: his bad debate performances, one theory I read in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fe3ae0/with_joe_being_attacked_in_the_media_for_his/fjmk89k):  >it's  more he sucks at debating friends he can't get "mean" against. Biden has, to my knowledge, never really had to debate a serious Dem opponent before, and debating your friends is a lot harder to do well than debating your enemies.   He never really had to debate and run against *friends and allys* before on stage, which I think is compelling. Like, he's such a big-hearted guy, he's struggles with words a little when it comes to criticizing Democratic Party allies.   But that's just a theory. Again, the fact of his medical status is that he has a speech disability, nothing more. I highly, highly recommend the above article.
We'll see in the rust belt coming up, but how can you claim Bernie does better in Texas when he lost it to Joe.      And now that Bloomberg is out, even more so.
I really think people need to get over this debate thing. Debates usually fail to move the electorate at all unless it is something like the Warren Bloomberg moment (and he did better than her in a lot of places on SuperTuesday). And have you seen Trump talk? Clinton by all metrics destroyed him as far as debates go. So much that we still remember "Puppet, no puppet. You're the puppet." America is also done with his nicknames. It will just energize them more.  Biden will do much better with working class voters, especially in PA, Minnesota, Florida, TX. The black vote has come out in record numbers (even bigger than anything Bernie brought in 2016). While they don't go to rallies, they vote.  Bernie is doing worse in terms of turnout than 2016. He didn't expand his base, and young people stayed home.
How does this work exactly? On the campaign site it says they use a peer to peer system. Does that mean that those receiving texts and call won’t see my actual number but a different one?
Already getting private attack messages from the “bro’s”, thanks for making my choice easier guys! 😂
I'm in New York.
I feel like everyone just assumed he had tons of money and staff since he had the name recognition. Yang said that Bloomberg hired most of his staffers, maybe Bloomberg will have them all working for Biden now?
I meant useless in terms of my volunteering has come to a halt, my state still hasn’t voted. I hope Biden takes some of her ideas on ending corruption and financial regulations.

Yeah I'm also not interested in associating with Sanders' (or Trump's) pernicious campaigns/supporters. Joe is the way to go. I'm vyin' for Biden.
Glad to have you on the team!
 >I am 20 years old and I’ve not been able to vote in an election yet.  Remember to vote in your local elections! Not every election is for congress and president and they occur at different times sometimes. So be sure to check your city's calendar.
Greetings and welcome, thanks for your effort.   It's true that Sanders supporters are toxic and harmful towards others.  Be welcomed here.
Thanks and glad to have you! Joe Biden is the now, but Pete Buttigieg is the Future!
Very cool. Is the vibe that Biden is getting the plurality of Pete’s support? I heard sanders is neck and neck with Pete’s second choice.
Oof, I'm sorry dude. I knew people who worked on Clinton's campaign and they were so heartbroken after 2016. I can't imagine how you must feel as a delegate, I really hope you get a chance to cast a vote for Pete in the future. It really sucks believing in a candidate and having them drop out or feeling like other people can't see what you see.
Welcome aboard, and sorry to hear you won't be a delegate.
I think Pete might actually be able to withdraw from the New York ballot. So hopefully he won't be on there. I signed a petition for him and I'd cry, too. But Biden is our best hope and with all the support and a good VP pick I think he'll beat Trump. I have midterm exams rn but then I'll campaign for Biden.  One thing that I think will help is that Obama won't be the sitting president and will hopefully campaign for Biden in the general. We can have all the cute Obama-Biden memes again <3
Welcome and thanks for your principled support!  *#RidinWithBiden #Joementum*
Sorry about what you've experienced. Thanks for helping!
Thank you for activism. Democracy and our party only work if Democrats get involved. I was a Dukakis precinct in 88 when I was 17, but never had the courage or drive to try to become a delegate.
How does being a delegate work? You get to decide the vote over hundreds of people? Or you wait and see their result then vote accordingly? Sorry, not from here. Just wondering.
RIDEN WITH BIDEN
They’re very important but I live at my college and when I tried to have absentee ballots sent for the midterms in 2018 they never came. I’ve decided to just go home for the primary in April and my he general in November this time around
Just because they said Buttigeig is not gay enough and also a CIA plant and a rat and called Warren a snake and said Biden is a senile pedophile and "Harris is a cop" doesn't mean they're toxic!! Surely all the other candidates will be eager to support Bernie!  Seriously though,this kind of crap is why Sanders has no friends.
It looks like people who were very engaged with Pete are probably skewing more towards Biden. All over r/petebuttigieg last night were warning posts about Bernie’s stans brigading our sub while we were hearing about the campaign ending. However I’m not sure if that translates from online to actual grassroots supporters.  Even if Biden doesn’t get all of us, it looks like the gains to Warren and Klob will hurt Bernie a lot when they gain viability in some locations.
I'm in like...twelve to fifteen Pete groups (I'd really have to count) and you're pulling in the overwhelming numbers from it at least on FB, albeit anecdotally. Couple people in the Jews for Pete group going Bloomberg (and I can't fault them for wanting a Jewish candidate, even if he is...well, Bloomberg), and a real few here and there going Bernie, most of whom sound like to me to be the Pete supporters who trend more progressive....which is par for the course given how wide Pete's spread of supporters is, political spectrum-wise. On the other hand, the Republicans For Pete group (which A, also has Dems and Independents, and B, is imo one of the best of the Pete groups, hands down) seems to be ALL IN for Joe, to the point that I've seen members saying they were on the fence but they're thinking about changing their minds because they value the other members' opinions so much.  A lot of the reasoning is the to be expected "have to block Sanders" idea, but I'd say most of it is based on the impression that Biden is the one Pete would want us to unify behind now. We've got a lot of respect for his opinion on the matter, for obvious reasons.  I'll also point out that the Bernie camp has been AWFUL the last couple of days, and I genuinely think that alone pushed a lot of people over the edge. At least the ones who weren't already totally fed up with that crap. But there was a lot of vultures swarming and downright lying and treating supporters like morons, and it isn't going over well.
Pete to Joe supporter here. I think you can expect a majority of his most active supporters online. There are some who liked him because of his more progressive policies but cared less about his rhetoric who are shifting to Sanders, but I’ve only seen one or two that I was sure were genuine. Most of us are disgusted by the way Bernie Bros treated Pete (and us) and Joe is the only logical transition.
I will confide in Biden.
I feel. This last midterm cycle Nebraska didn't have Senator elections and my District's rep is a shoein. Down ballot further was pretty much just one person elections and County Commish.
Don't forget, we have early voting now! Yes absentee ballots in NY SUCK. If I stay registered here over summer, I'll take a weekend trip during early voting for the congressional primary rather than dealing with it. Had to in 2018 and my ballot barely made it to me before my out of town trip (to volunteer in a swing state).
I was Pete or Biden. Preferring Pete but only going to give him a vote if he had a shot when it was my turn to vote. I’d probably be Biden first if it were 8 years ago and he was still sharp.   Pete did endorse Biden and I’ve heard (take with a huge grain of salt) he might be attending a Biden event soon.   Sanders has some pretty strange ideas. I would vote for him if he was the nominee and be okay with it because I know we have a system of checks and balances. But you shouldn’t have to vote for a candidate thinking “it’s good he won’t be able to accomplish most his policy.”   The mystery to me is why hasn’t Obama endorsed Biden? He doesn’t like sanders and they would be an incredible help.
^^^ matches everything I've seen. A few of the furthest left supporters shifting to Bernie (and honestly, Godspeed, maybe they can talk some sense into them...…..nahhh) but the overwhelming rest Biden.
Got pride in Biden?
It's extreme poor form for a former president to endorse before the race is certain. If Obama endorses Biden, and then god forbid, Bernie wins, he hands Trump a massive weapon and Trump will spend the rest of the campaign telling everyone he sees about how Obama didn't even want the Dem candidate to win so people shouldn't vote for the Dem candidate. Presidents almost never risk being wrong with their endorsement. They endorse in general elections, not primaries.
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks!
All aboard the No Malarkey express!
I want a VW Van, but still vote for Biden. Why not both?  :)
Love how bernie is driving a hippie bus 😂
This is adorable.
Cant say I like this cartoon. Paints Biden as an impolite man.  I think a better cartoon would be Biden running 3 flat tires in Iowa, NH, Nevada.  Then Clyburn helps Biden by giving him a new Tire in South Carolina. Then Pete and Amy park their cars and also help Biden out. Then they all get on Biden's bus and gently roll past Bernie.
You can easily tell who cares more here.
Feel like this is against the rules of the road.
An old Jewish man driving a German vehicle?

Same. I love VW buses! I hope the electric one isn't too expensive when it comes out, but it probably will be.
I've always secretly wanted a VW van, too.  I also wish the El Camino would make a comeback. As a homeowner, sometimes having a pickup would be nice, and an El Camino would be better on gas and easier for me to drive as a small female.  But the No Malarkey express has room for ALL Democrats!
I mean, it's a 23 window and everything.
But no lie I love those cars :(  Can we get one for Biden?
Hush your mouth, you heathen. :) <3   Some VW buses such as the 21 window are worth hundreds of thousands. If I ever win the lottery, that is what I am buying:   >On January 21, 2017, this 21-window Volkswagen Samba sold for $302,500, becoming the most valuable Volkswagen Samba van ever sold at auction.Jul 27, 2017

Because FJG is not the direction that America should be going in. Period. Also college shouldn't be free, but it needs to be cheaper. I think we all agree with universal healthcare but just see different ways of dealing with it. Bernie doesn't support a private option which I disagree with. I a union worker shouldnt lose my cheaper healthcare, and yes I've used that calculator to see if I was gonna be making or losing money. I also don't buy into the alzheimers claims. People are just nitpicking because he slips up every once in a while. Also rubs me the wrong way when people share him stuttering as some excuse. The man had a speech impediment his whole life. I'm not sure if you were looking for actual conversation but I'll give you an upvote anyways
Sounds like you’re pretty out of touch with the American population. It’s one thing to disagree and prefer someone else, but to not have the slightest clue?? Maybe you’ll realise that *you’re* the one who’s out of touch with reality.
til window count is a thing.
My Jewish grandmother refused to ride in a German car for her entire post-WWII life.  It’s a very common sentiment among survivors and their families.    But please, continue pretending you know the first thing about the world.
Why shouldn't college be free? It used to be extremely cheap.  Better educated more competent workforce is beneficial for society. I am including trade industry training as well.
The union this is hilarious. Many union workers support Bernie, and also why would the general population let you ruin their chances at health care?  Biden won’t get *anything* done with education or healthcare. So even based on your points I don’t see why you would support him.
Do you think conventional though is a good indication of *good* thought?   Do you think the American population is well informed?
*out of touch with primary voters over 60
My grandpa was like that, boycotting anything German, but everyone else in the family after that generation loves German cars and music and products and my dad married a German woman.

I don't know what I've got to do to get you to read. I said that I think that college should be cheaper, since you couldn't take the minute to read because of your blind bias. Since we're talking about the benefits of society, people that have money on the line are more likely to work. But that is not a scientific source so take that with a grain of salt. Convince me otherwise friend.
When did I ever say I was taking their healthcare away? Reread, we both want universal healthcare. And I would rather remain with the current student debt than have it completely free.  Don't just pick and choose what you want to read.
Ah I see. Americans don’t want Bernie Sanders so they must be stupid. Keep lecturing voters on how dumb they are I’m sure that’ll convince them.  But what you don’t get is my point. I’m not arguing whether or not Biden is a good candidate or not, I’m saying that it makes you completely out of touch to have no clue as to why he might be liked. The voters have answered, and will continue to, so get used to being clueless I guess. You remind me of when the media had a complete meltdown after Trump won, and couldn’t figure out at all why he was liked.
There are a few no-brainers. Don't vote for a grifter. Don't vote for a Trotskyist. Just because something is unpopular doesn't mean that it is a good idea.
Ya can’t win with just over 60 year olds, and he’s doing it. It’s a shame young people are all talk no action— I’m young and at least I showed up to vote unlike the twitter socialists
And you’re of Sanders’ generation, right?    Just go away.
And I said why shouldn't it be free? I didn't misquote you.      Your argument is people should be in debt from getting an education because otherwise they won't work? They have no drive to bring in income?     I'd say it levels the playing field between the rich and the poor and lets people get an earlier start on things like, buying a house, providing for their family.     My dad went to UCLA for like 200 bucks a semester, it didn't used to be like this.
Why would you rather remain with the current student debt?
Well he’s actually pretty successful so I wouldn’t say “Americans don’t want him”...  I also am not talking about polls. So YOU don’t get my point. I’m wondering *why*. Popular opinion has never had anything to do with what’s right.  That’s assuming numbers are even reliable considering voter suppression, manipulation, etc...
I’m not implying that “because something is unpopular it’s a good idea”. *I’m* the one saying that popularity has nothing inherently to do with an idea’s value. You knob.   Also the Trotskyism thing is reductive BS. And I agree that you’d have to be brainless to buy into it the way you have ;). Stop trying to no-brain things and start trying to brain them.
Lmaooooo ITS RIGGED!!!! That’s why Bernie is losing duh!! Voter suppression also hurts black voters the most who go for Biden so if you want to argue that...Bernies support only goes down. Or maybe America doesn’t want Bernie. Don’t hit your head on that ceiling on the way out :)
[removed]
How? How does the voter suppression affect Bernie more and please explain without just vague wishy washy anger. Blaming his loss on it being rigged every time is embarrassing for y’all.
I ask again: you truly believe it’s a level playing field? That there’s no systemic bias?  But regarding voter suppression: the demographics that it targets disproportionately are Bernie’s contingency. It’s not that complicated.  You do know that voter suppression targets specific demographics, right?
I’m aware that voter suppression exists, but I’m asking how it disproportionally affects Bernie voters. Please provide literally any reasoning or evidence other than just saying it does.
This is what's at stake.
This what gets me pissed when bernie supporters say they wont vote for biden if he gets the nomination. Especially point 6. Ppl can deal w a less than ideal candidate for 4 years. American wilderness, naturally forming american monuments? You fuck that up its gone for good.
#2 is what I tell everyone who will listen.
Bernie supporters will tell you that you don’t care about America’s youth or healthcare for your neighbor if you don’t vote Bernie 🙄 Actually I care about all that and more which is why voting for Biden makes the most sense.
Just one gripe here: we're not voting to treat LGBT people with dignity; we're voting to treat them like people at all. I know with all the crazy that happens every day it's easy to forget, but Mike Pence, the Vice President of the United States, supports "conversion therapy", which is the literal physical and emotional torture of children.
Good post, saved
[removed]
Whenever someone says they won't vote for if X doesn't get nominated I just mention that Ruth Bader Ginsberg is currently 86 years old.  That sentence alone should be enough to vote Blue in November no matter what.
I don’t mind voting for Biden.   Trump will smear Biden and we get four more years.
He married a gay couple... I don’t think his past on that issue matters all that much anymore
You may be joking, but in case you're not ... he very publicly "accidentally" (Imo intentionally) mentioned his support for gay marriage as VP before Obama publicly supported it, which directly led to Obama's public support shortly thereafter. See this article from 2012:  [https://www.politico.com/story/2012/05/obama-expected-to-speak-on-gay-marriage-076103](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/05/obama-expected-to-speak-on-gay-marriage-076103)  Edit: or this NYT piece which gets into all the details  [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/magazine/how-the-president-got-to-i-do-on-same-sex-marriage.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/20/magazine/how-the-president-got-to-i-do-on-same-sex-marriage.html)
But also mention that if Trump gets another term Clarence Thomas, the oldest conservative on the court, would likely retire in order to allow Trump to replace him with a younger justice. That would solidify a 6-3 Court for a generation.
But Trump won’t smear Sanders? He’ll smear whoever the nominee is.

Biden is clearly on a cognitive decline. It is so obvious. He is the most ill prepared candidate to take on Trump of them all. I would put my money on Sanders a thousands times over. How can you vote for man who's clearly entering the beginning stages of dementia/Alzheimer's?
No he’s actually not “clearly on a cognitive decline.” Sanders is the one who’s ill-prepared and learned nothing from the 2016 election cycle. Young voters aren’t reliable. And attacking everyone in your own party as the “establishment”, but then turning around and expecting them to support you is lunacy. He couldn’t even beat Biden in states he was “supposed to win” like Maine, Massachusetts, and Minnesota. Biden didn’t just sweep the south, he won key northern states.   Bernie wants to blame the corrupt billionaire establishment for his loss which dismisses the voices of countless voters, who he should be trying to bring to his side, not ostracize. On top of that, Biden was BROKE heading into Super Tuesday, many people did mail in voting (BEFORE the endorsements), and Bloomberg siphoned cotes away otherwise it would have been an even bigger blowout in some cases, like Texas. Sanders argument that he is more electable and will turn out more voters was soundly disproven.  His policies are too far left and will never get through Congress, he shows no willingness to compromise either. At least Liz Warren acknowledged that not everyone wanted to lose the health insurance they already have. Bernie is “my way or the highway.” He’s divisive and lashed out at the very people he needs to support him in a general election. He would NEVER beat Trump. Face the facts.
I see you decided to completely dodge the whole "Biden is in mental decline comment", nice.   Nah. The media has been engaged in a desperate smear campaign against Bernie Sanders and his campaign ever since the elections started, the criticism is incessant and continues today. I can't count how many times I've seen the talking heads crucify him.    Guys like Joe Biden have decieved voters into believing that attempting medicare-for-all isn't worth while. Of course it is. The reverberating effect of having a president who sought this out would be impossible to ignore. His policies are not too far left, nearly every modern, civilized nation on the planet has adopted these policies.    Joe Biden doesn't want to improve our health care at all, he just wants to stick a band-aid on it. Can't really fix an amputated arm with a band-aid. Joe Biden aslo does not advocate for the federal legalization of marijuana. How any of you can vote for a president that still does not support this is baffling. Federally illegal marijuana is a policy deeply rooted in racist politics and authoritarianism. Plenty of established research is publically available on the short and long-term effects, Biden has no excuse for this stance other than pandering to the right-wing vote.    Mark my words; Biden will lose 2020. We are staring down the loaded double-barrel of what will inevitably be another 4 years of Trump. To be perfectly honest, if this is currently the best the DNC can provide as representation, then I will be leaving the party and they will lose a vote permanently. This entire campaign has been a repeat of 2016 and I'm done with the corruption. This system cannot work for us.
Dodged how? I addressed it in the very first sentence. It’s false. Just because you stated it doesn’t make it fact.  >> Mark my words; Biden will lose 2020.   You’re wrong.  >>if this is currently the best the DNC can provide as representation, then I will be leaving the party and they will lose a vote permanently.   Bye 👋🏼   >>This entire campaign has been a repeat of 2016 and I'm done with the corruption. This system cannot work for us.  Ahh yes, when people exercise their right to vote and they don’t vote how **you** want them to, it’s corrupt. Sounds like excuses. But then again, that’s all your savior Bernie can offer as well, excuses. Blame the corrupt establishment for **his** failure to turn out the vote and build his coalition from 2016.
So you took all the substantive information I explained before that, and just tossed it out the window. You realize that's not how an argument works right? I've explained the corruption. I've explained why votes are falling under Biden. You haven't done anything to refute that. So idk what you're on about.  You did not address Biden's mental decline at all. You just said "Nope, not true". That's not how it works.
Joe Biden on Twitter: Senator @EWarren is the fiercest of fighters for middle class families. Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts, and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives. We needed her voice in this race, and we need her continued work in the Senate.
Her debate skills were top tier, particularly when she got fired up. I strongly believe the fall of Bloomberg is the work of Warren's incredible Nevada debate. Even without an endorsement, she's been one of the most influential figures to the success of Joe's campaign. I'll miss her on the debate stage.
Anyone see his reply?  > And to Bailey: Champ and Major would love to have you over any time.  ❤️
"Senator @EWarren is the fiercest of fighters for middle class families. Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts, and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives. We needed her voice in this race, and we need her continued work in the Senate. "     >publisher: @JoeBiden
Classy.
Aka she won’t be VP lol
[deleted]
We need everyone to get these fascists out of the White House , but yeah we need ALL of the fierce woman fighting for our democracy, our planet and our children’s future !!
Now that is class! ☺️
she is staying in the senate folks
I feel that Warren would do well in some Treasury position in Biden's cabinet.  Imagine being a bigass corporation trying to run away from taxes. And then you get an email requesting your presence to tesify before Congress, and the guest of honor is..... *Elizabeth Warren*.  That's enough to make grown men to wet their pants upon reading the email.
In my dreams, there is an awesome dog park where Bailey is running with Champ and Major and Buddy (god willing, he needs some exercise) and maybe even Truman (ugh, other beings, I'll just be over here)
It would be a mistake to take a sitting senator for VP in a state with a Republican governor. Now Senate Majority Leader Warren sounds mighty fine.
This doesn’t help if Joe is trying to be the unity candidate. Bernie said similar things to Joe, only Bernie said she could have a place in his cabinet.
I don’t think she’s cut out for Majority Leader tbh
You are right
I'd be stoked to have a Majority Leader/Speaker that wasn't a political hack. Make your whip the hatchet man, not the leaders of congress.
GET IN BUDDY WE'RE SAVING AMERICA
I gotta say, as a Hardcore Pete supporter who ended up voting for Warren, these memes warm my heart. You go, Joe!
I like saving America.
Need to add Beto skating on the windshield and Amy manning a Stapler Turret on the back of the Car
Need one with the whole Dream Team.
We're going to need a bigger car.
Ridin' with Biden
Time to get ridin'
I’m a precinct captain for Uncle Joe. Can’t wait for Monday.
💪💪💪
Good work, keep it up, thank you!!!
Go birds!
Thank you! Go Joe!
I just heard about a huge Sanders lead here in California.  Tell them to put some Bernie attack ads out here or something. 😬
God Bless! Give the bros hell for us!
Keep up the good work. Support from PA
Go Team! 👏🏽
Good luck
You’re doing God’s work 👍
Good work. Fuck the Eagles
I want to volunteer! I live in Florida but can make phone calls anywhere. Super Tuesday is a week away and he needs help!!! If you can provide DIRECT CONTACT INFO I would appreciate it.
Biden takes South Carolina
Joe is our uncle?!
[removed]
Joe “go vote for someone else” Biden
Looks like Bernie is winning all Super Tuesday states except Alabama.   Poor Joe, he’ll be missed.
I think his campaign should just write it off. California is solid for Nutjob for some reason. Focus on other states.
Dont go negative
That was just one poll. 538 currently has Sanders 4 points ahead Biden in the average.
Bit yikes, rooting for attack ads 😬
Sending more support from PA!
I’m texting some friends down in Florida and will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for this!

If you don’t agree with his ideology, then go vote for someone else.....  It’s a democracy
We did vote for HRC in the 2016 primary. I think there are a lot of moderates out here, especially in San Diego.
Delegates are proportional to the vote count and California is too big for anyone to just write it off.  It's a huge state so while there are a lot of far-left people there, there's tons of mainstream democrats there and there are even lots of conservatives.
I guess I don't get out enough but most people I know aren't like that.  Jerry Brown was pretty reasonable.  I think Trump scrambled people's brains so that the lower information people will default to doing the opposite of anything considered "conservative" as a matter of principle.  It doesn't matter if the policies aren't working because they don't follow enough to correlate the outcomes with the voting.
I would rather go negative than have Bernie be the nominee and lose to Trump.
Yeah, exactly.
Well the moderate strategy didn't work with Hilary.
Biden today at his St. Louis rally: "To all of Amy’s folks, to all of Pete’s folks, to all of Kamala’s folks, to all of the folks who have, Beto’s folks, I’ll tell you what, what a gigantic difference it’s made. We’re gonna unite this party and unite this country."
Kamala's huh?  I'm guessing that's the next endorsement then.
I’m gay for Pete.
Didn't know Biden worked for MSNBC  \*sad Yang Gang sounds*
Accountability? To the people who got you where you are? In MY politics? Shocking.   we stan any time Joe mentions Pete, anyway
I’m guessing Kamala then. He didn’t mention Warren. 🤔
Pretty classy of him to respect Warren's decision to not endorse anyone yet.
Wouldn’t mind Kamala ( or Demmings ) as the VP. But an excellent statement, united we stand !
Fuck yea
Possibly! I’m waiting for that one to come. I’m sure it is soon. But also tbf her supporters made the Biden migration a long time ago - they were the first of us!
I think he may be meant as someone who dropped out and her suporters voted for biden. I personally dont thonk her endoresement makes a diff inthe states voting in next 2 weeks
I wonder if that's the endorsement he alluded to yesterday evening
Turned out to be accurate! 👍🏼
I’m not gay.  However if Pete was in front of me I would strongly reconsider what I previously said.
I'm a straight male except for Pete.
I would say maybe he’s just mentioning his endorsers but Kamala hasn’t :(    (Maybe she’s the endorsement he mentioned yesterday and it was a slip)
That’s my guess, only other thing that makes sense would be a big national figure like Pelosi or Obama. Could be HRC but I don’t think she’s bringing in any new voters
I am gay, and I was for Pete, so I'm gay for Pete!  I'm married and Pete is married, so it's not going to work.
I'm sure it is, but the Gang never passes up the chance to manufacture blackout accusations. (Saying that as someone still loyal to the gang, but who will be happily voting Biden... twice.)
HRC might hurt him more than help him to be honest, I love her but we need to be honest about how her national popularity levels are at, I wouldn't be that surprised if she doesn't even get a speaking part at the convention, or if she does it'll be the first day.
Could the Yang Gang have split more than other candidates? I notice he didnt mention Warren supporters either, whereas Pete, Beto, and I think Amy went HEAVILY Biden. Wouldn't surprise me if Kamala did too. Just wondering if he maybe doesn't want a bunch of pissed off Yang Gang Bernie stans yelling about it.
Agreed.
Yang Gang even split over whether or not to keep voting Yang!
Joe Lockhart on Twitter: The Democratic "establishment" is not delivering wins for Biden -- Democratic voters are doing it. Blacks, Latinos, suburban women, college educated and working class. It's insulting to these voters to suggest they are being coerced.
The ''Democratic establishment'' is just a boogey man just like Trump uses ''Deep State''.
"The Democratic "establishment" is not delivering wins for Biden tonight -- Democratic voters are doing it.  Blacks, Latinos, suburban women, college educated and working class. It's insulting to these voters to suggest they are being coerced. "                   >Tweet publisher: joelockhart
But when Bernie runs TV commercials to try to convince you in 30 seconds to vote for him based on sound bites and images, that’s a legitimate appeal to the intellect.
The most shocking aspect of this is to discover that millions of African-Americans are part of the Establishment. Why didn't anybody tell me?
That’s the sad part, it’s used to discredit the democrat process, to further create division. Unfortunate some people, not only falling for it, but also trying hard to promote it.
>I like the democratic establishment.   That's why I'm a Democrat.  Had to stop there, because now I'm dead.
I wonder if they realize this is only gonna turn off more voters who now feel as if Bernie supporters don’t think their views are valid.
I love how people are complaining that too many people dropped out and that rigged the vote for Biden..  &#x200B;  Like..imagine hoping your candidate wins just because the vote was split a specific way, seems to be the opposite of democracy.
What's infuriating to a lot of ethnic minorities, and particularly black people, is how the term 'working class' has been used by the Bernie side to erase black voters. When you have an overwhelming number of black people voting for Biden, in the South, from an oppressed environment, in areas where people face daily oppression and are just trying to make a decent life for themselves, **they are part of the working class.**  &#x200B;  But nah, they only voted for Bernie.
I’m starting to think Sanders supporters believe that anyone with a 9 to 5 job is the “establishment”
Yep. The Venn diagram of conspiracy nonsense between the Trumpster and Bros demographics is really freaking crowded right now.  They both blame the media for everything, cite establishment, elites .. eventually it will be Deep State from the Bros as well
I personally think that's targetted to his audience and fan base. I voted for Biden but I'm part of the younger age demographic that voted for Bernie and, to be honest, it works on us. We want quick information. Sound bites, flashy images, leading us to believe we can get some social (media) value or social acceptance with a Bernie vote. You don't need to actually go OUT and vote to gain that benefit, it's just the appearance.   At the end of the day, for many of us in my age group, it isn't about actually going out to vote or choosing a candidate that will best serve us. It's about sharing on Facebook or Instagram we voted for the most hyped up candidate so that we can feel like we're smart and part of the cool kids' crew. If Biden manages to offer that image or social acceptance to this group, I bet they will jump ship.  Just my $0.02. Source: millenial living in the SF area all my life
I mean, that's kinda why they hate Pete so much.    He looks and sounds like someone who has a job.
Establishment is just another other word for 'not agreeing with AOC/Bernie Sanders/radical left'.   Biden's  win really transformed the atmosphere. Until today I basically had given up and thought that Bernie Sanders was conquering the Democratic Party. I'm glad that people showed I was wrong. Democratic Party is not lost.
That's pretty much what the word was used for originally when Bernie and Biden were teenagers.
There’s already Bernie Bot leftists who support the deep state conspiracy, look up at Kyle Kalynski from Secular Talk who’s got hundreds of thousands of followers.

It must takes a lot to drop out the day before your state's primary. I have immense respect for Sen. Klobuchar doing this for unity. She would have been a great president and she'll continue to be a great senator.
👋 Hello Amy people! I'm a Pete supporter new to Team Joe as well! It's a rough day for all of us, but I'm happy to see our candidates and our teams are focused on unity.  Let's go take take down Trump together! 💪
Voted early and passionately for Amy yesterday. Definitely disappointing but not entirely unexpected.  Very proud of the Biden endorsement. We’re on a mission now!
The Klobucharmy marches with Joe now
Post history checks out, this account is legitimately pro Klobuchar and pro party pirate!  Welcome and I hope your positive energy rises the tide with ours.
Amy's polling avgs in Texas + Pete's are twice the difference between Sanders and Biden right now. Joe can win this thing tomorrow!!  Source: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/tx/texas_democratic_primary-6875.html
I’m here as a former Amy supporter. I’ve been a Joe Biden fan for the past 30 years. Was hoping for a woman president but what we really need is a moderate that can stop the ugly division of our country.
Welcome aboard! As a Betomanaic one of the things I appreciated most about Team Joe is they didn't ask me to give up my love for Beto in order to assimilate. I think the Amy Army will fit in just fine.
I'm a Biden supporter but I feel like Klobster and Amy Army are way better nicknames than Diamond Joe. We need to up our nickname game.
Greetings and a warm welcome 2 All the Amy peeps.
Biden has always been my second or third choice. i’ve been an Amy supporter since the first debate and while i’m sad about her dropping out, i’m really excited that this, along with buttigieg’s pull-out, will give momentum to a candidate who can beat Bernie and then Trump. team Biden!!
\*waves\* the Klobucharge has come to Team Joe!
I was an Amy and then Pete supporter. So...rough weekend. Anyway, started donating to Biden over the weekend. I saw the writing on the wall. Go Joe!
Amy is what good representation looks like. She is able to reach across the aisle and get stuff done for her constituents. A perfect balance of urban and rural interests, the Minnesota DFL and Amy are models for Democrats across the country. 💚
Here from Amy. Pulling for Joe now. But will support any of the candidates in November.
I'm not going to lie, as a Pete supporter I hold a little bit of a grudge that she held Pete back in Iowa and NH without a viable path to the nomination, but it's not time for petty bickering.  I'm willing to put it aside and unite against the populists.
I voted for Amy, but Biden has my support now. Go Jo!
Did phenomenally well in Iowa and NH, and on the debate stage.  Putting country before ego and stepping down now, when it must be SO temping to say "I'll just wait 24 more hours..." is admirable.  For full disclosure, I never took to her due to that story about the way she treated her staffers.
Wonder if the Bernie people will rally around Biden when the superdelegates select him at the convention.
Amy - DFLer 100% in
Yes! I wanted Amy too, but ended up switching to Biden a week ago, largely because of these polls (at Biden's low point on 2/18) which showed him leading swing state by 8  while everyone else was within the margin of error against Trump. Swing states are all that matters unless there is a landslide.  [https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/nbc-news-wsj-poll-sanders-opens-double-digit-national-lead-n1138191](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/nbc-news-wsj-poll-sanders-opens-double-digit-national-lead-n1138191)  I'd love to see Amy as Attorney General! I'm glad she didn't dilly dally and endorsed Biden at the same time. Like Pete, I think she wanted no part in possibly helping Sanders become the nominee. I'm glad Pete is endorsing Biden now too.
SKOL!
Amy we need you, thank you for joining the new moderate block   We are going to have a voice in this thing as long as we stick together
I’ll vote for Uncle Joe, but only if someone can show me that he also knows tomato paste is a vegetable
She seems like a possible VP slot. I’d like to see her and Pete get some sort of position in a Biden administration.

Thank you! I loves me some positive energy.  Let's turn the Orange Godzilla out of the White House.
I decided late on Baemy, but would have been very pleased with Biden, Buttigieg, Warren, or Yang.   We have such a deep bench of talent running.  Not much of a Bernie person, but I won't harangue them; their vote is sacred and I respect that.
I really liked her, but she just never got the momentum she needed. Her surprise surge in New Hampshire was incredible, but the coverage of her surge was drowned out by all the people pissed off about the coverage of someone other than Sanders
Biden/Duckworth 2020!!!
A Biden/Harris ticket could be vibrant.
Oh, I rather like "Diamond Joe".

Biden Klob makes more sense.  Biden has PA and down the East, West is solid blue and Klob can get MN, WI, IA and MI.  Both times a MN VP was used we won.  HHH and Mondale.
But it's not punny and there's no rhyme sigh

I'm just fucking petty like that haha. I totally understand though, time to move on.
Call your registrar of voters and let them know you made a mistake on your ballot! You can do that in CA at least
Let us know what happens!
MN makes the best VPs. They make good Presidents too but we’ve never gotten that far. :(
Well, how about Riden with Biden?
👏👏
Peter Baker: At the moment, the markets have now wiped out roughly 83 percent of the gains of the entire Trump presidency.
When will they learn that simply throwing gasoline on the economy does nothing to grow it in the long term?
The fact that he thought that simply hiding it would save the stock market is ridiculous. Of course, the stock market will inevitably drop a bit when something like this happens, but Trump has handled it terribly. This has been public information since January, and Trump has probably known about it since December, and yet we still have hardly any testing kits. As soon as it became clear that China didn't have the virus contained, we should've been cranking out testing kits. South Korea has managed to mitigate the crisis very well, and their overall mortality rate is below the global average since preventing the spread means they can give individual patients better care. We should be emulating what they're doing, not pretending everything is fine.
Another economy ruined by a Republican for a Democrat to fix.
Dude i don't want to see this shit. i'm trying to forget how much money i lost. goddamn
Hey Trump supporters you winning yet?  You lost pretty much every gain you had since 2017.  Congrats!!!!!
PROOF it's a Dem conspiracy! (I know people who think this about the coronavirus, etc)
It's almost like the way he tries to build up the economy is highly unstable as it emphasizes the business over the consumer meaning if something affected the consumer base, like I don't know a pandemic, stuff starts falling apart.
When its crumbling anyway, what they are doing will only make it worse.
His comments about the cruise ship were some true "does he know he is saying that out loud" crap.   In that moment alone he communicated to the public that if there is ANY way in which it seems like throwing them under the bus would help him even for an hour he would endanger them without hesitation.
*Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth*
The GOP is like a bunch of shitty teenagers.  Parents go out of town and they trash the house, wreck the car and run up the credit cards.  Then complain when there is no money for other things. They know the grownups will have to fix it. Its a strategy.
Let's be honest here, much of whats happening right now would happen regardless of who is president. Trump is making it worse, and his handling of the virus is abominable for tons of other reasons as well, but an Oil price war + a global pandemic are both things that would have almost certainly happened if Hillary was in the white house right now, and the market would be responding similarly (albeit probably less severely).
And then the Democrat will largely fix it, get zero credit, and in another 4 or 8 years Republicans will be voted back in, amass even more power than they had before, and ultimately ruin the economy again
Right? I also wonder how many businesses or individuals will go bankrupt with all these closures and cancellations.
Do they think Iran, Italy, and China are pretend places?
funny, I was thinking about the Chernobyl series earlier today, especially the party meeting scene where the old man tells them to "contain the spread of misinformation" and that they'll be remembered as heroes for it. I can't imagine what world people live in where they think just ignoring something or hiding it will make it go away.
New Rasmussen poll (yes, Rasmussen!) has Biden beating Trump 48-42
Some highlights  >In a hypothetical matchup **last September**, Trump edged Biden 47% to 43%.  >**Trump would beat Sanders**, an outspoken socialist, **by seven points** if the 2020 presidential election were held today.  >**Biden is clearly seen as a more likable candidate than Sanders.** Forty-eight percent (48%) of all voters view Biden favorably, 48% unfavorably. >But just 38% have a favorable view of Sanders, while 60% regard him unfavorably. This includes 14% with a Very Favorable view and **42% with a Very Unfavorable** one.
He has to beat Trump 52-48. That guarantees an electoral college victory.
The polls say that we're going to win but we need to work hard in order to make sure that the outcome  happens. We can't have a repeat of 2016.
Somehow I doubt Trump tweets this one.
Wondering if a recession does come would Trump lose the way Goldwater did against Lyndon B Johnson? Seems like a possibility now
\#vote
I'd vote for a wind-up toy bellhop monkey with clapping symbols over Trump.
If the economy continues to dive it will be gg
We all believed the polls in 2016, too.
60% is not out of the question.
I am the 42%
We need to flood the zone with positive ads for Joe and chainsaw-level attack ads against Trump in the fifteen states that actually matter. If Bloomberg drops a billion dollars on this and we fundraise like crazy, we can do it. And we definitely need to boost the senate candidates in Colorado, Maine, North Carolina, and Montana.

He just has to win in Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Ohio. Those 4 states are the only states that matter. Thanks electoral college!
The (thus far) good economy is really the only thing keeping Trump from polling in the mid 30s. You talk to any conservative that isn't full "I hate immigrants" and they will eventually say they are supporting Trump because of the economy.   That's gonna change quick when these retirees start seeing their 401ks tanking.
Add me to the list.
I was very confused because I thought you all were talking about the 42% in the subject line.
me too!
And Kentucky, Georgia, and South Carolina!
> And we definitely need to boost the senate candidates in Colorado, Maine, North Carolina, and Montana.  and Arizona, South Carolina, Kentucky....
If they think we’re going to get Ohio before Florida, they’re not paying very close attention.
If Biden wins Michigan (likely), Arizona (currently beating Trump), and North Carolina, he doesn’t need Wisconsin, Florida, or Ohio.
Wisconsin is going to be very tough. 300k were removed from the rolls in 2016.
His handling of the coronavirus sure does not help. Sure, right now its effects are not in every home, but if he continues prioritizing the damn cruise ship companies over the American populous, and the deaths start piling up, it will look terrible on his part.
Me four
And Arizona, Texas and Alabama!
Would much rather not waste money in Kentucky or South Carolina
Biden is bearing Trump in the last 2 polls in Ohio, by 2 and 6. In Florida he’s up 11 and 1
_populace_ is the noun FYI, _populous_ is an adjective...sorry to be that guy
YYYYYEEEEEEAHHHHHHHHARRRRRR!!!!!
Why do you think it would be a waste?
Where are you seeing this Ohio poll? The last one I can find on 538 is from October.
Just not ready to flip quite yet. Give it 6 or so years as more people move to the sun belt.
Because neither of those states will flip in 2020.
Oh you’re right, I didn’t even notice how they were
If Kentucky somehow flipped I would cry tears of joy.  Having lived there most of my life, I agree. Probably focus major dollars elsewhere.
How do you know? Genuine question. Are there polls that say this?
Yeah people saw the governor go blue, but that isn’t really indicative of Presidential voting patterns. As long as Medicare is protected on a local level (electing a Democrat as governor), it’s  fine to vote for someone to gut it on a federal level. Weird phenomenon.
Literally pick any poll you want
I've looked on realclearpolitics and fivethirtyeight and didn't see any polls for either Kentucky or South Carolina. Found this, which had McGrath and McConnell neck-and-neck in January: [https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000170-7541-da94-a9f2-ff6364500000](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000170-7541-da94-a9f2-ff6364500000). And found this, which had Harrison and Graham neck-and-neck in December: [https://www.changeresearch.com/post/south-carolina-post-and-courier-poll-december](https://www.changeresearch.com/post/south-carolina-post-and-courier-poll-december)  I don't know enough to speak to the quality of these polls, but I can say I'm not finding any polls that show there's no chance. What polls are you looking at?

Polls like that are useless in January.   In a national election, both of these states will go strongly for trump, he will pull these candidates over the finish line. Both states have well funded republican parties.   The point is that money is not unlimited. It makes far more sense to spend ten million on a winnable seat such as Arizona, instead of splitting it between Kentucky and South Carolina which have little chance of flipping.   Also, you aren’t finding many polls because pollsters don’t waste money on states that aren’t competitive
BEWARE: We have active trolling in the sub. New supporters we welcome you. Please don't listen to the ridiculous negativity.
Bernie bros are going to thrash a bit.  They got news from outside their echo chambers, and it's pretty bitter for them.    Their candidate can't grow his base.  He has systematically ostracized himself from every other candidate.  People don't want or believe in his revolution.  Instead, they have flocked to Biden's positive message without ground operations or funding.  And the momentum is building.  So let them thrash for a while.  Don't take them on.  Just report them, or welcome them to join the winning team.  They're going to be traumatized for a while, but will hopefully realize they can get what they want in a kinder, feasible package.
There will be a lot of trolls, this is inevitable.  But as a longtime lurker, it's so nice to see the bloom of activity on this sub!
I know. Just had a Bernie bro call me a "dumb pathetic ass" on this sub...What is the purpose of that?  In the words of John Legend: “Some of you Bernie supporters do quite the disservice to your candidate, who seems to be a great human being. Try not to drive people away with your nastiness"
As a former Pete supporter, I am really glad to see the kindness here. Thank you for treating us with open arms. I will be happy to vote for Uncle Joe here in Georgia!
New here! Bloom supporter before.
Thank you for the reminder. We Pete people have been through it before, and we will stick to RoTR and will not let them drag us down.
Trolls = Malarkey  No Malarkey.
Team Pete was constantly baking new batches of Troll House Cookies so we're here to help squelch those comments. We ain't got time for that, we have a country to save.
Oh, im coming over from the pete subreddit. Im accustomed.
Also, kind reminder to please be sure to use the report feature if you come accross rule breaking behavior. We're getting a lot of activity and the mods can't be everywhere. Help us by identifying bad actors.
I wanna thank the mods for keeping this space safe from trolls. I know you all are probably working twice as hard after all the endorsements. You are the unspoken hero’s of safe and productive speech on this sub.
It’s not too tough to look back into someone’s Reddit history if they’re genuinely toxic to you.  Double check if they are who they say they are - I’ve seen several “Pete/Amy to Bernie” people today who have posted about Bernie for the last 90 days or so.  I’ve also seen plenty “NEVER BERNIE” people who are historically pro-Bernie and trying to spin a narrative.  Take the minute or so and make sure you’re not being trolled or lied to. It will do wonders for your mental/emotional health.
You guys are doing your thing. There are a bunch of us splitting duty between r/P_B and here now. I know our mods had a couple of tools helping them against the onslaught, and it might be worth exploring options.   Auto-hiding/collapsing new account posts certainly helped, and that's just one example.
Time to wield the ban hammer.
Out of curiosity I quickly glanced through some of y'all post history and almost none of you are in r/neoliberal \- we'd love to have you! It's the largest Biden sub by far, and we have great policy discussions (although the memes are more popular now with the excitement from Joementum!) - I invite you to join us, and this comes from a Biden Precinct Captain in NV!
Everyone is welcome here 😊
Not surprising; the Bernie bros can't fathom how on a Joe Biden sub, there can be Buttigieg/Warren/Yang/Klobuchar supporters co-existing peacefully, whereas the Bernie subs are all "Pro-Bernie Bros" only.  So obviously they have to come to this sub to troll or "convert" us.
As a Pete supporter, I can't speak for everyone but I am accustomed to the bad trolling behavior from other candidates supporters. Just report the trolling and have the mods remove it and move on. ROTR will guide you here just as it did in the past for us. To a big victory for Joe.
A suggestion: Restrict new accounts from the subreddit  I find it odd that folks were following another candidate for some time but only just recently (hours/days) created an account to post/reply here.
Come at me Bros!!!!   Nah, I’ll report but I have to admit toying with them is fun when they come my way.
Bernie Sanders does not deserve to have his name related to whatever the stupid trolls are doing. It is rude to everyone and it's a cheap tactic to smear on the real voters who are respectable and civil.
Indeed, we went from 6k to 8k subs last night!
Did you report the comment?
Welcome! My husband was a Bloomberg supporter, too. Glad to have you on board!
Truth!
Yeah dual PB/JB mod here... we at the r/PB are super good at weeding out trolls. We're ready and actively working on it every day. We brought our bot power over here to filter those chapo nerds. We're on it. We have a country to save.  Edit: at least twelve consecutive high fives for "troll house cookies" lmao
Oh crap. My shitposting!!!! They will see my terrible jokes and insane ideas as a dungeon master!!!  (I do have a fair amount of anti Sanders grief on some other subs. Still angry about the snakes. Not to mention 2016 bs).
neoliberal is by far the most funny/informative sub day in day out
Trolls and harassers are not. (Other than them, your point stands lol)
The problem seems to be that trolls are targeting users in private messages,  not in this subreddit. Only Reddit HQ administrators, not mods, can deal with that.  I'd suggest posting your ideas on r/ideasfortheadmins!
I agree. Also, how do I get the flair?
Mayor Pete gave Bernie an opportunity to repudiate his trolls on stage for the homophobic smears.  Bernie chose to pretend they didn't exist.    Bernie not only deserves his association with them, listening to his rhetoric, he encourages it.
Team Pete moves as a family :)
Yes I did! Thankfully the moderators acted swiftly to remove it.  I was just a little shocked because I didn't think anything I had posted was overtly rude enough to garner such a nasty comment, especially in the JoeBiden subreddit
Thanks for the solidarity! And I say this as someone who had someone message me (not post to the thread) calling my 8 year old daughter a "fucking idiot" after I posted a cute pro-Pete picture that she drew for me. I swallowed my bile, reported and blocked, and did not respond. It's hard sometimes, but it's who we need to be.
As I'm sure you know, if I never see a rat emoji again in this lifetime, I'd be good. Thanks for being here.
Community options (not while viewing a single post) click the pencil icon to edit your flair.
I still think Sanders doesn't deserve that.  https://youtu.be/NrmGsikfRRw  He despises them, and clearly states that he wants nothing to do with them. Being anonymous on the internet means you can do anything and trolling is no exception(anyone can call themselves a 'Bernie Bro' and be as racist or sexist as they want; which is nothing Bernie Sanders stands for)   He has been fighting against many years of homophobia, and it shows.  https://youtu.be/fARW2YwerTc  It's just my stance on this subject.
You have some new Harris then Warren now Team Joe neighbors, too. 🙂
It doesn’t take much, if people are looking to troll. Thanks for reporting, that makes our community work better! 🙌
We'll just let that person sit alone, as Chasten says. :)
I'm sorry that happened.  What an awful thing for someone to do.  Admiration for how well you handled it.
Yeah tonight I had a convo with a Warren supporter friend of mine who said "it's more than snake and rat emojis..." they really destroyed any possibility of unity. It is unfathomable to me that he could continue to campaign as someone who can build coalitions.
Thank you! I had the same flair on the Buttigieg subreddit and want to move it here. I’m glad this community reminds me so much of what I loved from Buttigieg
Welcome!
Damn right.
Thanks! But believe me, the stuff I was saying in my head did NOT adhere to RoTR!
Warren supporter here (presumably soon to be former) and the Bernie bro’s are unbelievably nasty, it doesn’t matter how many of their policies you support, if you fail their purity test even slightly you’ve suddenly become the enemy in their eyes. I can’t remember another “democrat” so divisive, we’re on the same team! They really need to stop with this conspiracy theory bs and respect the results of democracy, they’re acting like trump people.’
Populism usually does not embrace the values of democracy.  Accountability, coalition building, compromise, consent....

Secretary of State   I mean, we need this guy to clean up this fucking mess Trump made
Anyone would be lucky to have Buttigieg in their cabinet.  He's smart, speaks several languages and has experience in military intelligence.
One of the finest minds in politics.  Use him well, Joe.
Pete as VP would unify the party beyond belief and I wish it wasn't too much to dream of. Young and old. Straight and gay. Moderate and progressive. Intelligence and heart.  Diversity vote (Biden) and white vote (Pete). I just wish skin color and gender wasn't a factor & that "balancing" the ticket for the wrong reasons was known to be worse than just choosing the ideal combination of 2 caring human beings.
Nice ,.figured as much, but still is nice. He gave him his own special spot as well.
Hell yeah
I was thinking maybe Chief of Staff - it speaks to Pete's background as an administrator, he has the opportunity to see how Washington works up close, and it would help Pete network.
DHS or CoS are pretty likely. SecDef or SoS not as much given experience levels. I'm honestly hoping for CoS. Way more power there than a lot of people think.
Secretary of State, please make him Secretary of State. I can’t imagine a better person to present us in these trying times.
In another era, Pete would have been  the obvious VP choice, but these days the ticket must be balanced, so he'll have to happy with a cabinet position.
Booty-Judge-in-Chief    But seriously, I think Pete could do a lot of good in any place he takes within the Biden administration
I really liked both Joe and Buttigieg. I did not know much about Buttigieg before this even though I live in a close by state, and have been very glad I got to learn more about him. I leaned toward Biden because I thought he stood a better chance vs Trump/Sanders.   I truly hope I get the chance to cast a ballet for Buttigieg to be President one day.
[deleted]
I love how much heart Biden has!  Although they finally found a resolution low enough to actually make Biden look bad.
Ayy lmao
I'd be very happy to see Pete as Secretary of State, Ambassador to UN or National Security Advisor.
I love the idea of sending a gay Secretary of State to Saudi Arabia and Russia, forcing them to treat his partner with state ceremony.
Plus with all the languages he speaks, he's great for that role.
That, or Veep. Honestly, Joe doesn't need help with the minority vote. Having Pete be Veep would let Pete learn the presidency first hand, and set Pete up really well for him to run next time.
National Security Advisor?
While CoS would fit fairly well with Pete's skillset, it's a largely thankless job that tends to consume the person's time and soul. I think Biden sees that getting Pete into the administration will help him build out his resume a bit more, so he'll want to slot him into a visible yet flexible position. Likely some flavor of Secretary or Deputy Secretary.  I don't really have a good feel for what would be best. State might be a little above his station at this point -- I think promoting a diplomat from within the org would be a good look for the next administration -- but Interior, Labor, or Energy might not be bad. Education would be great but I think everyone's been clear about slotting in an actual educator.  At the end of the day he might just be pulled onboard as a special advisor so he can be involved with a varied portfolio.
UN Ambassador
DHS would be an odd one. Not necessarily bad, but....I'd have to think about it to decide how I feel about that one.
No. That's largely a go nowhere position.
I can just see Pete with some Russian linguists on the flight to meet Putin.  Walks off the airplane, having downloaded Russian to his brain like in the matrix.
An intelligence officer who won’t embarrass us
Have you ever heard the time Pete actually already addressed that? Someone asked him once how he'd handle having to deal with homophobic countries like Saudi Arabia, and he just went "soooooo..........\*exaggerated shrug\*…...they're gonna have to get used to it."  Iconic. What a legend.
He would also be the youngest person to ever be appointed Secretary of State.
Omg yes
I don't think Putin or even MBS for that matter particularly cares about homosexuality on a personal basis
We did that already in Germany with our neoliberal former foreign minister Guido Westerwelle
Holy moly would that ever be delicious.
And would help with young people.
Abrams helps with putting Georgia in play. Otherwise, he needs to tap someone like a Tammy Baldwin. Give a little more progressive flavor to the ticket.
Or HUD. Let him do what he did to the economy and urban parts of South Bend to the rest of the country.
Good points
I could see him in HUD, energy, or commerce. He’s a huge policy wonk and anything he can get his hands on to impact infrastructure development will be big for him.
UN Ambassador
FYI: Interior Secretary is always a Westerner.  Considering the federal government controls over half the land in a lot of Western states and it causes a lot of animosity between those states and the Feds, it would be very insensitive if Joe nominated Pete to head Interior.   That’s one Cabinet portfolio that’s definitely off the table.
DHS is mainly because it is intelligence related but not the highest level ones where you'd expect a career operative with 20-30 years of experience to be in it. The SECDEF, SoS, SoT, CIA Director, DNI... all of those are posts that you really want someone that has been in the community forever for. DHS is new enough that no one has that kind of expectation. That's also the reason i think Chief of Staff is likely. Younger (30s-40s) driven individuals don't seem so out of place in that part. Yes you see alot of 50s/60s but it is also very involved in policy and a great training position for the presidency.
Pete has a history of making go-nowhere positions go somewhere. He’s going to be great and elevate any position he ends up with.
Helps when you have intelligence.
If he's not a VP or Secretary of State, Energy might be an awesome choice. Slot him in somewhere that lets him go all out on climate change, it's one of his signature causes and he'd be all about it.
This. Or HUD. Or SoS.
Ah, good point. I'd forgotten about that. Thanks for pointing that out.
Has a CoS literally ever gone on to become president, though?  Like, I don't disagree from an experience point of view, but \*politically\* I'd be concerned.  Re: DHS, that's fair, actually. Full transparency, Trump's ICE tried to get my uncle deported because of ICE's own failure and was only stopped when the New York government \*aggressively\* interfered, so there's an automatic jump between that and DHS as a whole in my brain that always leaves a reflexive bad taste in my mouth. My gut reaction was something along the lines of "DHS bad, Pete good, do not want."
But VA secretary (and I say this as someone whose entire family was career VA) is a disaster waiting to happen. They never last, they're never liked, they inherit blame that at this point goes back generations practically, they're pretty much universally despised, and just to throw salt in the wound they're basically invisible to the wider public half the time.  The VA absolutely needs to be totally rehabbed from top to bottom, but I don't want to see Pete blamed for poor policy and excess backlog that dates back to the Bush administration, personally.
Climate Change is an interesting area to consider. I think the responsibility at the federal level is split across multiple agencies and departments, though. This might be a great opportunity to set him up as a special advisor, or Czar, spearheading the federal effort.  It would be a HUGE task. And there will be a lot of minefields for him to tiptoe through, both with Republicans and internally with some members of congress. But it could be a huge, huge win if he's able to pull off one or two big items within Biden's first/one term.
Organizations take their tone from the guy at the top so I think it would be a good thing for DHS to have a good guy at the top.  As for CoS going on to become president - not really. Pretty much it's always Congresspeople or Governors. Very rarely anyone else. Pete won't get elected in Indiana any time soon. CoS is really the best spot for him from an experience point of view, from influence point of view, and from usefulness to Biden(Which is what we should really consider most) point of view. Having a good, driven, disciplined, intelligent individual who can help direct the Day-to-Day operations to support the desired objectives is really important.
This is a good point. Maybe this isn’t the one for him, but I do like the idea of him elevating a historically lower profile position.
And from the sounds of it, never funded properly. Thus ensuring it struggles.
Looks like us Boot-edge-edgers are already doing our part to help Joe: BIDEN raised $1 million after 9p last night when BUTTIGIEG dropped out of the race. A $6-million day for TEAM BIDEN

And we will continue to!  As Pete said tonight, his was never a campaign about a single person, or a cult of personality. It was about the opportunity to bring back unity and decency to a toxically divided nation and political dialogue.   The way everyone has so swiftly, comprehensively, and enthusiastically rallied around this message with Joe has made me feel so positive in this last day, when Pete dropping out was at first such a bitter pill to swallow.   Happy to be here, love the tone of this campaign, and am genuinely optimistic that America can rediscover its common ground, its soul, with this campaign
That made me think, will Pete transfer his remaining donations to Biden Campaign?
Butti donor here, I threw Biden $5 after SC. I'm a broke college student so I can't do much more than a few bucks here and there but I have absolute confidence that Joe is the one we need right now.
Glad to join this team. Never thought I’d be so on board with Joe Biden, but let’s fucking do this.
good shit, my friends
I kicked in a few $ for Joe.  After organizing and working for Pete.  That was an amazing experience
Well shit. You just made me feel a heck of a lot better about all of this. Well said. So much can change in a day. Now if Bloomberg would just step aside...
Exactly--we need to unite! Behind an actual Democrat who is civil and decent. But willing to fight. And while I wish it was Pete, I am convinced more after tonight, with Pete, Amy, and Beto behind him,  that Joe is the candidate who will unite us to victory.
I heard that he’s going to pay all of his staffers’ salaries and health care for another month, which is super thoughtful. I don’t mind my donation going to support them :) I don’t think he can just transfer everything over anyway.
That's an interesting question. If he isn't officially on the ticket with Biden, can he even legally do that? Or would it be considered a donation in itself and therefore subject to limits?
Not step aside. Also Unite!  0% of Bloomberg supporters will be going to Bernie. Lol  And bullshit his money’s no good here. Fuck it. We’ll take a billion!  Please and thank you Mike!
Plus Lily is fantastic!
I guess by creating a PAC or Super PAC, it can be done.
There's definitely a limit on candidate-to-candidate transfers. Not sure how a VP selection would affect the situation from a legal perspective. My guess would be that Pete's folks could rename the committee to something like "Win The Era Committee" and then spend the money during this cycle, if nothing else.
There's some crazy news coming constantly since Saturday's SC primary and Pete started the match to unity...I feel like *holy crap what's next*?  .....can you *imagine* that this incredible democrat unity we're seeing right now prompts Bloomberg to step away from the race tomorrow? And throw his support behind Biden, saying he's proven he has what it takes now in his estimation to beat Trump... And say that all his ad buys and field offices are now Joe's...  I mean, I'd be shocked...but also glued to the news just to see all the pundits flip their collective shit.
Oh yes. No. Yes. (sorry I'm Midwestern) By step aside I mean drop out and bankroll this campaign. Please and thank you.
It is not the norm for that to be done. Just FYI  Especially for a young guy with very few resources and a long political career ahead of him.   Maybe some, but I think Pete will bank much of that money for the future.   I expect many of us here will likewise be rallied behind Pete in the not to distant future.
Haha  🤑  In all seriousness ive given a larger share of my net worth to Pete and now Biden than Bloomberg has given himself. Drop in the bucket 500mill of 68 billion  The exact same as giving $500 of $68,000
next  time we won't be the one kid on the playground who can't transfer in funds from a previous race.
He’ll possibly target certain down ballot elections.  One of the ways you can push your agenda and build up a network.
And then claim “but im not doing any big money fundraising” becuase u already have cash and an established network of big money donors  Hypocrisy 101
\~ \* \~ it was a joke \~ \* \~
As was mine...  Much confusion now
.....it appears we've played each other  carry on, sir
Joe biden was (to my knowledge) the first VP to come out to support gay marriage. People stated that this would hurt Obama’s re-election bid.
Oh, Biden was the first administration official.  People thought he might get dumped from the administration for it.  Instead, he convinced Obama and the administration that this was the only correct course.  This is what moral leadership is.
This was the best Joe Biden gaffe.
Big facts r/politics doesn't want you to hear
Amy's party the DFL in MN (Democratic Farm Labor)   Put it in the party platform in 1972  Responding to the State Supreme Court ruling, in June 1972, at the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) State Convention, delegates voted to add a plank to the party platform supporting same-sex marriage rights.[5] This is the first known case of support by a major United States political party for same-sex marriage.
I wrote about this the other day. It was monumental for me in terms of coming out of the closet.  Look, Joe Biden May be a gaffe machine. But, it’s also part of what makes him endearing. He doesn’t mince words, and he speaks from the heart. He’s honest, and trustworthy and you know where you stand with him.   That is part of what makes a great leader.
it's so funny that this was a "gaffe"   a few more gaffes like this could make the country a better place for everyone
A lot of the attacks on Joe seem to A) forget the context of the times and B) discount that Joe, like many Democrats, has changed his stances.   Examples - 1970s, Roe v. Wade, 1990s, tough-on-crime bills....
And people are rewriting history trying to say Don't Ask, Don't Tell banned gays from serving in the military.  Being gay already was banned! Had always been banned! What DADT did was make it possible for gays to serve in the military by just not talking about it and the military (usually in psychological screening) couldn't ask about it. It was a big step in the right direction.
Oh, so he protested for it aswell as Bernie did? Back in 1986 in Vermont? I don't think so...
This isn’t the official story.   > Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention, and since Biden had previously counseled the president to avoid the issue lest key Catholic voters be offended.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden

The only kind of flub that matters
How far we've come - 2016 had Trump fans attacking the likely Democratic candidate and saying they have mental and physical decline that will soon kill them , 2020, now we have a vocal slice of progressives attacking the likely Dem candidate, saying they have mental and physical decline that will soon kill them.    Meanwhile, Bernie repeats 1981 stump speech, enters cardiac arrest and then returns ... Bros :  "Anyone who doesn't vote for this man ignores the youth and intentionally murders tens of thousands of Americans!"
Would you call this gaffe a big fucking deal?
Roe Vs. Wade is huge you can’t just simply say that he was like that before and changed his mind. Kind of like saying “he hated gays before but he has changed his mind now”??? What?  He is a career politician who was fitting in with his fellow politicians. Another reason why people voted for Trump was that he wasn’t a career politician.
DADT was an awful, garbage thing all around and yet IT WAS THE LIBERAL FIX TO WHAT WE HAD. It was the "if you keep it to yourself we'll pretend not to notice" alternative to fucking hunting down gay people and throwing them out  But nobody wants to acknowledge that because it either isn't convenient for their narrative or they literally haven't been alive that long.

**Joe Biden**  Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. (; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who served as the 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, Biden is a candidate for president in the 2020 election. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and in 2008.  ***  ^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/JoeBiden/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)
People can change their minds, if people hadn't, gay marriage would still be illegal. The entire country shifted, and Biden helped that shift, he took the position when it was not popular at the time.
It was the 1970s....   he has since changed. I’m disappointed that he, or anyone, once held these beliefs but I *value* personal growth. I’m not going to condemn someone who has changed. What’s scary is people who *still* hold these beliefs...  there are current and very real threats to Roe v. Wade.
This is the kind of nuance people don't like to remember. DADT was horrible policy, but it was a step forward. Progress isn't getting 100% of what you want right away, it's taking everything you can at that moment in history, and then keeping the fighting going for the rest.
I'm gay. You're coming from an ignorant and privileged point of view. Without DADT we would not have the rights in serving we do today. Does DADT work today? No. But it was a stepping stone to get us here. Learn your history.
He took the position because it was popular at the time. Or we can pretend a man went 70 years homophobic and conveniently decided “nah let em get married” the second that a growing majority of people supported that idea in the lead in to an election
I agree with you. IMO, lots of people change their believes but I just can’t trust him. To me the road is clear as it was last time with Hillary. We need a change and people who flip flop on their views when it’s better suited for them are not cutting it.
Al Gore was one of the first major politicians in my memory to be openly and aggressively pro-gay at a national level and in public office, and when he ran for president he was the only one doing so with the matter of fact plan to legalize gay marriage, while every other democrat was still arguing about whether civil unions should exist. And yet he was directly and personally involved in DADT from the early stages (and pushed for it to be more generous than it was). Clinton himself ran on a campaign promise of lifting the ban altogether.   These weren't Mike Pence republicans forcing evangelism on the rest of us. We're talking established liberals trying to pass policies that were wildly progressive for their time, and having to meet republicans halfway.  https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/clinton-documents-gays-in-the-military-111784 ^ a source re: the planning days if you feel like becoming an Al Gore fan 15 years past the point of relevancy
Keep reading. They're saying it was a lesser of two evils.  Same team!
I really love this not liberal enough fallacy. It totally dismisses the reality that there is a conservative movement. It's like the GOP doesn't exist.
You stopped reading after like three words, huh? I'm not the one who needs to learn something, pal.
The story is about how it actually wasn't popular.
Two of history's greatest “flip-flops” belonged to Abraham Lincoln, who reversed his 1860 campaign positions against an invasion of the South and against meddling with slavery in the states....   I’m simply saying that “flip flopping” isn’t inherently disingenuous...  The reason I chose Abe was because you said that you find It hard to *trust* “flip flippers” - and what better example to present than *Honest* Abe? 😉

Joe Biden is the apparent winner of the Washington Democratic primary, NBC News reports
Let's end this primary tommorow!
Five out of six 💎☕️
Now is the time for Bernie to drop out. For the health of his supporters and all Democrats.
Congrats Joe
AP called it too
Drop out already Bernie!
I'd say for the health of voters but even if Bernie dropped out they have local stuff to vote on.
The 6th was an exceptionally poorly run ND caucus with few voting sites, limited hours, and extremely low turnout.
[removed]
Local stuff tends to have lower turnout though!
Bernie (pathetically) just asked for more donations yesterday. I honestly think he’s just trying to scrounge up whatever money he can and leave. If he has to run until the convention so be it. And I’ve seen a lot of people on his sub saying it’s Bernie or nobody, so there’s that to worry about too. They really seem to dislike Biden.
[removed]
That's on those voters. Just as it's on Bernie's voters who well, didn't vote.

Uh, my point is that the disease will have less spread if there are less people!

Some terrible news for Joe Biden supporters just came in...
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie
EXTREME LEVELS OF MALARKEY DETECTED
Feel like pure shit, just want [this t-shirt](https://i.imgur.com/PyHLdAq.png) back 😭
I kinda wish I could buy some Biden merch, but uh, my flair shows how illegal that would be.  ^(I still wish I could have got some Beto merch too.)
you got me, goddamnit.
Buy this guy an ice cream.
They need to update “the” T-shirt with Kamala and Cory anyway😉
Dammit. I get paid Friday! Was gonna pick up a sticker or two.
His [campaign buttons](https://imgur.com/gallery/qgaRLzS) are on point!
Still waiting on my hoody :(
You just busted my malarkometer :(
Anybody got an extra bumper sticker?
Cannonballl!!!
I really want one of those FOLKS buttons.
Oh no! I'm looking forward to buying a South Carolina for Biden shirt soon (when I get paid) to support the campaign. I'm a ladies XS so hopefully they'll have teeny tiny sizes in stock on Friday.
SHIT! FUCKING MULARKY!!!
bro you just posted malarkey you are going to lose subscriber
CNN headline earlier was "Early exit polls show Biden in a crisis" and I was in shock.  Then I reread it, "Early exit polls show voters trust Biden in a crisis."
now i cant even get a fricking hat
I want to buy some of his campaign's merch so much, but for obvious reasons can't :(
fucking hell....
[Malarkey level of this: 7 - MONSTROUS.](https://i.imgur.com/VMqGh8x.jpg)
That's Joe? 😮
The German amazon shop offers unofficial campaign shirts where someone just prints the logos on regular shirts. I got there a Beto and Delaney shirt.

Wait, why would it be illegal? Is it like foreign campaign finance stuff?
A man fantasizes....
And Yang!
Right?!  I ordered the damn shirt on Saturday.
[It's done, btw. No Yang, though.](https://store.joebiden.com/joe-beto-amy-pete-mike-cory-kamala-and-me-unisex-black-tee/)
You were meant to destroy the malarkey, not create it!
Nice, gonna keep that in mind. I'm currently worried about Italy getting shut down, other countries might too soon, so I'll wait until things calm down before ordering.
Merch purchases are considered campaign donations and you can't have foreign money in the election.  That's also why merch purchases count toward your total donation limit.
Insta-buy. Thanks!
Cool!
A former Bernie employee is using our virtual phonebank tool to call voters and tell them Joe Biden has dementia — and is live-streaming it. We’ll cut him off in a little bit but I figured it’s worth everyone seeing this stuff in action.
Do these people want to beat Trump or not? Bernies not out, go ahead and try to bring as many people to your camp as you can, but just damaging a potential democratic nominee with lies only helps Trump.
This is going to hurt Bernie.  It reveals them as devious liars, and people are already very skeptical of them.  So what else is the Bernie campaign lying about?  Edit: I think this may actually hand the debate to us.
Woooooooooooooow. I went from Bernie to Pete bc of this behavior. When Pete dropped out and endorsed Biden, I was 100% sure I would vote Biden, but as the days went on and I saw more and more Bernie ads (they are targeted towards me still) and spoke to friends and coworkers, I started to waffle and wonder if I should vote Bernie after all. This is reeeeally cementing me towards Joe ):
God, what a wanker.
He made the video private, in case anyone was looking.   Looks like it was 5 hours before it was deleted.
lol i hope it was worth getting sued
Gotta do what ever he can to get them student loans paid for...
Keep it positive.  The Sanders camp is on its death throes.  I can be aggressive because they completely trashed Warren for things she never deserved.  You will win  Don't stoop to their level.  Let the tantrums fade.
Been defending Joe to friends and family since Super Tuesday. Most of them don’t know his policies, or only negative things they hear about him. Don’t be afraid to defend him!
Now can we call them brown shirts?
[removed]
The end goal for many is to "stick it to the establishment". It's the same bullying tactics used by Tea Party, Trump and his Trump supporters to squash dissent.
I obviously can't know how many but am convinced there is a section amongst them who would much prefer Biden to lose in a Biden Vs Trump scenario to preserve their unknowable bragging right that Bernie would have beaten Trump two times over (2016,2020) - keeping their ideologically purity and intellectual superiority
Bernie’s most fanatical supporters legitimately do not give two fucks about beating Trump
I've personally came to certain conclusions. That's whatever. But Bernie going full on negative won't earn him more votes, I'll just make the moderates feel shunned.  His campaign staff is extremely dumb.  They're cutting their own throats.
Do you think Trump won't be negative towards Biden? Bernie is still playing soft compared to what Trump will say. The DNC is fucking up by making it easy for Biden now against Bernie, because they won't have the option to change debate rules when they're debating Trump.
iTs JuSt OnE pErSoN
But... how is it lying if they think they are telling the truth
Man this is what disappoints me the most about that campaign. It really does a disservice to many of its supporters with stuff like this.
Is it something he can get sued for? Or is it against the law? The answers to both questions should be yes imo but I know that our laws around election interference are pretty out of date
Finding a real job obviously isn’t a consideration.
Blaming their failures in life on the governments lack of loan forgiveness is basically their mantra
You realize that he was harassing people and giving out their personal information over the internet, right? This isn’t a mean comment. It breaks several laws.
Agreed. We need to focus on empathy for people that haven't gone off the deep end YET.  There are still plenty of good Sanders supporters out there. We need to show them respect and even admiration for their willingness to fight for a better future.
They all would. They love telling people that and they mean it.
As a Bernie supporter who would support Joe Biden in the general if that's the way it goes, defeating Trump is not my primary objective. Trump got elected because enough of the country was so dissatisfied with how the Democrats, through poor trade deals and the ACA, failed to address the needs of poorer and rural Americans that they voted for an outsider that they thought would fix it. Trump lied, obviously, but that's no surprise. I'm more concerned with addressing the issues that allowed Trump to gain as much popularity as he did, or we'll see someone else promising to clean house again very soon.  The ACA hit many people's wallets hard, it's not THAT affordable and still can result in costly co-pays and high deductibles. I see expansion of it as a bandaid fix that won't resolve their issues and I think M4A would be a better solution. Unfortunately, focusing on only defeating Trump is reactive, not proactive. I'd like to see more talk about solutions instead of just, "Trump is a bigot who must be stopped at all costs"
It's a person who was let go from the Sanders campaign. So I really don't hold it all that much against Sanders.  I blame Russians and conservative trolls, who have been trying to split up your country. I've seen people on r conservative tell others they should tell people Bernie or Bust. And Ive seen lots of comments on a Super Tuesday megathread spam "fuck warren" with day old accounts, so they're obvious trolls.  Sure .. Sanders could have done a better job inoculating his followers, but I dont think that is all on him. To me your primary process doesn't seem all that democratic. So it's a vulnerable process. Though I have to say you have made improvements on it compared to 2016. Though a lot of Sanders supporters don't really see that and may not be able to see it till Sanders leaves politics. My point with this is that your process is vulnerable.  Anyhow, I think Joe's movement could still use a lot of support from Sanders supporters when you take on Trump so you will have a Strong mandate. Though I doubt Joe should pander much/at all, because you dont want to alienate moderate independants for November.  I think what a lot of Sanders supporters need most is the feeling they're being listened to. That we understand their grievances. Some of which are pretty legitimate. Like how income inequality hasnt decreased in the US even under Democratic presidents.
Because it is reasonable to expect them to know better. There is a wealth of debunking information out there about just this topic. They should know better and I think they do, they just lie.
This is what politics of division leads to -- populism calls people to action by drawing on their fear and anger, and drawing a line between "us" and "them". That inevitably draws in hardliners who don't have strong morals or guiding principles.
Depends if this was fake or not. Whether he can be sued or not, it’s definitely not worth it, doubt this guy has an assets to seize. It is illegal to use voter registration data for anything other than authorized electioneering.
We have loan forgiveness. That’s what is so insane. You pay 10% of your discretionary income for up to 25 years and if it’s not gone by then it’s forgiven. Yes that means you only make 90% for that time but it’s less than 10% if your making little.  And if you are in public service you get it forgiven in 10 years. Of course there was some issues with that recently because of the types of loans people were trying to pay early on in the process, but anyone who’s taken a loan since 2010 or 2011 wouldn’t have that issue if they just make sure their payments are certified.  I have 180k of student loan debt myself. But I’m working in public service and working to get it paid off through PSLF.
I wasn't talking about him. This dude deserves to face the law   I'm talking about online. It's going to be so much better when you can just smile your way to victory.  I apologize. More just stating my opinion
Give Trump four more years of packing the courts with young conservatives and you can kiss goodbye to any hope of enacting M4A for the next 30 years.
I think it's worth remembering that getting rid of Trump means a lot of things, including making it so we can fill at least one crucial Supreme Court seat with the potential of filling two more. Progressives are playing defense here. This is really a last stand kind of thing for many of us. If we don't get rid of Trump we'll be losing decades of progress.
>Unfortunately, focusing on only defeating Trump is reactive, not proactive. I'd like to see more talk about solutions instead of just, "Trump is a bigot who must be stopped at all costs"  And I would like to see, at a minimum, how you even get to fifty Senators--which ones would vote for it-- with that, never mind sixty. That roadmap has literally never been laid out by Sanders. I prefer realistic discussions in the meantime.
You do lay out nicely some of the issues you have with Biden. But I dont think M4all has that much popularity with the average voter of people who actually vote.  To get Sanders revolution going you actually need to get young people motivated to vote en mass. And that just doesnt seem to be happening that much. Sure... it has been better then 2012 or 2016... But its still around 20% to even 5% depending on the state.  To me that just seems abysmally low no matter how you look at it. But on the upside, there is so much room for improvement.  Say you have 4 friends under 30. So there's 5 people in total. If you can get 1 of those 4 friends more politically engaged to go out and vote you've doubled voter turnout in your friends group.  Though its hard to get young people engaged with voting for people pushing 80. Though that was a result of a crowded democratic field. Only people with name recognition seemed to have a solid chance.  But Sanders does seem to have a lot of pull with young people. Sadly politicians arent convinced they're really a voting bloc worth persuing.
FYI, I also don't want to suggest the political process in our country is perfect. We're also struggling.  Your Primary system could very well be better then what we have here.
Broke: "Not me, us"  Woke: "Not you, me"
Biden wants to improve the repayment numbers too, so it's 5% and 20 years.  One of my friends posted on facebook an article about someone with crushing debt who says if Bernie isn't nominated he might just give up and vote trump. So I posted that they didn't have to give up, if that's their issue clearly Biden is better than Trump, right? No. I was asked not to respond to her political posts again. :(  It's like that with every one of Biden's policies. They're either very close to Bernie's, some are even the same, or at least they give Bernie supporters something. But they don't care. It's all about fighting the establishment.
Not good enough for Sanders supporters.  They want to not have to work at all and have their loans repaid by the tax payer.
It's worth noting that this doesn't apply to private loans, and that with income-based repayment, you currently pay taxes on the forgiven amount. Luckily Biden wants to change that taxed part, but if you're not doing PSLF and don't have the right loans currently, it doesn't seem like a long-term solution.    I've read about Biden's plan for PSLF, and I see he wants to add a 10k a year of forgiveness for 5 years plan. Unfortunately, in our situation, with 6+% interest rates from grad school, 50k doesn't actually go that far. Does he still plan to keep full forgiveness after 10 years as well? Hopefully he still intends to keep it.

Sure. I agree that it makes sense to be nice but there were thousands of Sanders supporters who cheered this on. This is one of the worst episodes of online harassment I have ever seen where no one died.
If they wanted that they coulda got the GI Bill oh well
That’s GOP talking point number one about ANY democrat.  Go back to Wisconsin, Paul Ryan.
And they will lose.  Let them lose.  Let supporters of candidates they gleefully tried to destroy push Biden forward.  He and his campaign has no reason to get their hands dirty.  But again, that has nothing to do with you really. More just talking.
Then they would have to go into the military and do something.  It all pivots on not having to actually be a person that is willing to contribute in any way to society.
> That’s GOP talking point number one about ANY democrat  Any Democrat offering college loan forgiveness when there are measures in place already like what he's talking about.  >  Go back to Wisconsin   Listen here Jack, I will go to Wisconsin, and while I'm there I will eat some cheese, but not until it gets a little warmer, and I'm going to wear a sweater.
You clearly haven’t watched the stream. He was harassing real people, mostly older people. Late at night. There is no excuse for this behavior.
Arizona General Election Poll: Biden 49% (+6), Trump 43%; Sanders 38% (-7), Trump 45%
Let’s flip Arizona for the first time in quarter of a century ! What other states can we flip (maybe N.C. or FL)?
One of the first polls to show that much of a difference between Biden and Sanders vs Trump. Hopefully this is a trend all over the country.
Warren fan who voted for Bernie here. Come in peace. I'm from Phoenix and I know there's no way Bernie could have won Arizona, these people are so loyal to McCain and would love to kick trump out of office, but someone that progressive could never win in Arizona. Arizona going blue lets trump hold on to Wisconsin and still lose, it would be huge.
I keep relaying the same message but I want to reiterate the implications of flipping Arizona. If Biden wins Michigan, Arizona, and NC, he wins the election. He wouldn’t need Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or Ohio.
This is now the important election!
I don't know that pollster and it's an outlier so far, but good news if we can get more along those lines.
While this may look good, for the primaries we still need a lot of help, If you are in AZ, VOTE
If Joe can flip NC (which I think he damn well can with this rate of black and suburban turnout) that would be huge. Downballot NC democrats like Cal Cunningham need all the help they can get to flip seats
Definitely NC
NC for sure!
Florida can be flipped! Remember that Florida went with Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012!
NC, maybe we finally break through in Florida after decades of heartbreak.  And, don't bank on it but..... Texas
Quarter century.
I imagine we'll see the same thing in Florida.
Live in Arizona, can 100% confirm
Thanks for the encouraging words! We hope everyone feels welcome in this sub. We're going to need everyone doing as much as they can to beat Trump and win back the Senate.
This may be the one state where the senate carries the presidency rather than the other way around!
Wonder if there's going to be a South Carolina effect as well. Lots of people real pissed off at Graham betraying McCain's memory.
Arizona isn't likely to be the tipping point state. It's wildly unlikely that Bidens wins Arizona and loses Pennsylvania and Michigan.
Pennsylvania and Michigan are much more likely to flip before Arizona does
North Carolinian here- Cal is a terrific candidate and a super guy. He's still going to need a strong Dem turnout to win in Nov.
Ah my bad - I’ll fix it
yep.
Astronaut mark Kelly is the coolest
Andrew Yang on Twitter: Since I started running, I always said I would support the Democratic nominee. The math is clear - Joe Biden will be the nominee and I am glad to endorse him for President. Joe knows how serious the fourth industrial revolution is. He and I have spoken about it at length.
And now Joe is probably to call Yang the first thing in the morning lol. (They call each other just about every week, apparently.)
If Joe wins Yang is a for sure cabinet member.
Joe has always respected Yang's ideas. Hopefully they will get to work together and prepare this country for the effects of automation and AI
[removed]
:)
I really hope he's VP but I think that's probably a longshot  It makes so much sense in my head imo, Yang appeals to progressives in a way Biden doesn't, he has a younger base, he has a passionate online base, and can boost turnout among Asians, is an "outsider", etc. Biden meanwhile has strengths among older voters, lots of irl campaign infrastructure, is a "establishment" candidate, etc.  They seem to be perfect for ticket balancing *and* they paradoxically share a lot of policy goals (public option, carbon taxes) and have a great personal relationship
That’s not true. Most yang gang are on board with only a few Supporting Bernie. Most of the anger is from Bernie supporters pretending to be from yanggang
Nah. Not even romotely true. Some are. But not even most.
He literally said he'd support the nominee. Why are Twitter replies dumbfounded?
Those people are mostly salty berners not Yang Gang most of us in the Yang Gang always knew he would support the nom.
Cause they are emotionally wrecked
Yeah that doesn't make any sense
Coming over from Warren's camp to support Joe!
Welcome! I love Warren. I was a Warren/Buttigieg supporter, but like you, think Biden has the best chance of beating Trump.  Let's do this!
Welcome! Warren's campaign might be in its twilight but #Persist will never die, and we'll need lions like her in the Senate under the next administration.      Biden winning ST states where he spent, in some cases, literally zero money was absolutely incredible and we're all excited to see what he can do now that he's consolidating support and can get some real campaign infrastructure built. Trump isn't going to know what hit him.
Joe winning in states he spent nearly nothing and in some cases didn't visit are truly remarkable.
Sounds great! Glad to have you in! Always welcome! Feel free to grab your friends as well and bring them in!
Also a Warren voter moving over to Biden! Excited to cast my vote come November.
Former and future Pete supporter here! Hello and welcome to our coalition! I'm heartened to see everyone uniting like this. If gives me a great deal of hope for the future.
Thanks for the welcomes folks. I'll admit Joe wasn't my first or second choice, but it is now time to unite. The Sanders campaign is now looking forward to a slow painful death, Obama should put it out of its misery by doing the inevitable and endorse Joe.   \- Proud Obama/Biden democrat, I #StillBelieve
The fact that this coalition is growing makes me feel so dang happy.
Welcome! <3
Welcome and thank you for showing up!
Welcome!
Namaste, new supporter. Pete refugee here who's found a lovely new sub to engage with. It's good to see the party finally coming together.
Warren is awesome, I could see her as part of a  Biden administration.  Welcome!
Go Joe!!!  Now we need for form a Democratic Voltron.
Hello and welcome! 👋🏼
Welcome to the Biden camp! Thank you for supporting Joe 💕
Big time Pete supporter, voted for Warren yesterday, but happy to support Joe from this point forward. Let's go y'all!
Welcome. I went from vacillating between Kamala and Castro, to Warren, and then looking at Pete before deciding on Joe based on some of his policies + potential coalition (which turned out in force in SC and ST). I know how you feel.  If it makes you feel better, one thing about Joe is he doesn't really hold on to grudges and he doesn't surround himself with "loyalists." He knows when he needs to extend an olive branch, and he's shifted left a bit. I want Warren to continue kicking ass in the senate, but I wouldn't be shocked if Joe offered her treasury (which she would deserve...I'd love her as VP but I suspect Joe will go with a woman from a swing state) and mostly free rein as an acknowledgement to the leftward shift and the progressive movement.
Welcome!

Why are you even commenting on all different politic subreddits? You are from Bolivia. The United States elections don’t not concern you.
Same. Now I am just consoling myself with bad jokes and silly statements #Yeet4Pete!
yep, we will need this type of dynamic in November.
People want normalcy. People want decency. People want democracy.
And you're a nasty little fella. Please learn to be kinder to others and thank you.
I live in the US pal, 20+ years now, I care about both.
Biden literally broke 538 Mississippi polls chart
I can be proud of my state for politics for once, yay!!
Off the charts!

*Oof*.

I must go, my people need me.
That's what Bernie gets for turning away from the "establishment" voters.
He’s about to break Arizona’s too 💀thanks kyrsten for being a legend as always
And the hearts of many Berners!
Don't get complacent folks, translate this in to real votes and high turnout
[deleted]
I was so hoping Hood was going to win.
Are you suggesting that Democrats living in Mississippi don't get a say in who leads the Democratic Party?
Like Virginia and North Carolina? Possibly Texas? They haven't voted yet but Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are all important too.
I was too, but I wasn't surprised that he didn't. There is no reason Democrats should struggle so much here; we have a solid guaranteed base and plenty of people who would be receptive to the message if they heard from literally anyone who isn't a Republican. It's just a combination of voter suppression, an anemic local party, and little outside attention from Dems that does us in.
Well, the state east of you has a Democratic Senator and the state west of you a 2 term Democratic Governor so keep your hopes up! I hate to get mean but I honestly can’t help but enjoy MAGA snowflakes throwing constant slow-motion meltdowns because of their inability to elect anyone here in Connecticut. They would probably have gotten the governorship, but a payday loans guy and Trump clone, Bob Stefanowski, won the crowded primary against actual candidates and that did them in. They just love shooting themselves in the foot here.

Biden under Secret Service protection again
good. We don't want some lunatic far left / far right activists doing any harm to him.
About time. Don't get me wrong, Jill Biden was clutch on the defense, but she can't be there ALL the time.
Not a moment too soon.
I wonder if he has the same codename
Thank God! Jill and Symone can’t be his body guards forever! Although they did do an amazing job if I say so myself.
Jill and Symone need a break :)
Hope Joe and Jill enjoyed their last days as civilians.   Because after November, they’re both going to have Secret Service protection for the rest of their lives.
In the future some Trump-lite is going to request Secret Service protection ahead of time to appear more presidential
Yay! About time.
Yeah it's sadly a possibility in both sides. Possibly worse on the left for now, establishment conspiracy to stop their boy they think. Dangerous nonsense
I'm 100% certain one of them would break self-isolation and go in as a human biological weapon to touch Biden and even sneeze at him.
Far left attack's are very rare. Far right attack's are much more common and Trump is doing his best to make it happen
How about some lunatic Corona virus? Has Biden released his test results ? [https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/487561-biden-has-not-been-tested-for-coronavirus-campaign-says](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/487561-biden-has-not-been-tested-for-coronavirus-campaign-says)
Symone and Jill need a break
Only took Symone Sanders getting knocked out with an iPad once to make it happen
I hope they go with diamond.
It is the same
Probably.  Bill and Hillary have always been Eagle and Evergreen.
Your mouth to God's ears! :feeling hopeful for the first time in awhile:
Unfortunately so are Donald and Melania.  And Barron for a few years still.  And Joe can’t cut their protection without cutting it for the Obamas, Carters, Clintons, and Bushes.
Generally candidates consider it a big disadvantage because it's a lot harder to talk to people and have any good conversations.
[deleted]
> Possibly worse on the left for now  Dude c'mon
This is a galaxy brain take. Right wing violence is on the rise and a much bigger problem right now. Leftist violence doesn’t even really exist in the US.
Grow up
Let's avoid even talking about that in jest. It just takes one person on a power trip to do something like that for him or other people, and I don't want to give anyone ideas.
It's actually Celtic
Unfortunately?  I don’t get bent out of shape about Donald having lifetime Secret Service protection.  If he loses this election, he’ll become a persona non grata among Republicans and everyone else in the country.  He can keep his protection as he lives out the rest of his days in increasing irrelevance.   Plus, he does have access to our country’s military secrets so I would rather him not be kidnapped by a foreign nation or rogue group.  Secret Service protection of former presidents—even unpopular ones—is a small price to pay to protect our country’s secrets.
If anyone can overcome that disadvantage, it's Joe. You can tell how sad it makes him to not chat up close with voters after every speech due to COVID-19. He just loves talking to people.
Didn’t stop Hillary talking to voters in 2016 or any incumbent president running for office in years past.
Unfortunately so are a lot of Americans.
They’re succeeding
Russia is always here and literally controls the world to a large degree  The most powerful man on Earth is Putin
I'd appreciate some sources on your statement. I'd like to read about it.
Other than that one communist shooter last year, I can't remember any left wing terorists.
I wasn't joking.
That’s a fair point.  Of course if he gives up our secrets willingly that’s a whole other thing.  We should probably revoke his passport just in case.
Either way. Best to not to put that idea in people's heads. It only takes one person to see it and think, "hey, I could fuck up a lot of people pretty easily and without any accountability".
Well in Italy they declared it anyone who is confirmed to have COVID-19 but defies their quarantine, will be charged with manslaughter.  So I'm somewhat certain the US will, even if retroactively, would do the same.  At least it should, anyone knowingly infected who even without malicious itentions should suffer suffer the consequances, barring a few exceptions.
I hope they do that here.
Holy Shit! After Tuesday, 538 shows Joe winning ALL remaining states. We goin' to the White House, boys.
Too soon.  Don't celebrate until we're across the finish line.  I would expect to lose WA, ID, and Democrats Abroad tomorrow.  We may even lose ND (voters are largely college students). All will be close, but it may give Bernie good press.  However, MI, MO, and MI should substantially increase Biden's delegate lead.
We are so close in Idaho and Washington. If you have a few minutes today, join Team Joe so we can make it a clean sweep.
I looked at MI this morning and I thought that something was broken on their site.
Bust out the ice cream scoopers!!!

I really don't like Nate's model. I think it's too easily misinterpreted and doesn't handle the impacts of narratives from unexpected results.
Just in time for the tennis court to be complete, where Dr. Jill and President Biden can have a doubles match with President and Michelle Obama.
Bernie will keep feeding Trump with attack material until the convention. That's pretty much what he did in 2016 before going on a book tour while pretending to campaign for Hillary.
Come.on....didnt 2016 tesch us anything..one vote at time..long long way.
The predictions don't look good for Sanders even within the margin of error.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💎💎💎
At this point Bernie’s strategy seems to be to stay in the race and hope for the 1% chance that Joe is either struck by lightning or attacked by a vegan.
[removed]
It's selfevulent that Joe Biden will be elected by the...go...you know...the thing!
I don't mean to celebrate. I just want to perpetuate the excitement of Joementum.
I think Biden wins ND.  Heidi is a strong influence, its not a pure caucus this year and Amy has been up there.  Amy carried the MN border counties even after she dropped out.  She won more counties then Bernie did!  7 to 4.
Generally curious: why would North Dakota, a state whose economy is practically centered around fracking, vote for Bernie?
Voting in the morning here in MO.
I spent about 90 minutes on the text team yesterday!  I'm awaiting more texting campaigns today.
I'm so far ahead of you. My wife and I budgeted giving money to Joe over a few charities this year because we sincerely believe that our charities will benefit more over a Joe presidency than the way they were gutted because of Donald Trump.
I was reading an article yesterday and our WA Secretary of State predicted final turnout here will be over 50% which is bonkers for a primary. Only 30% of ballots had been returned as of Friday evening so there is still a TON of vote left to be cast and received.
Just had a moment where I realized that Jill is going to be a bad ass First Lady. She’s good people.
Guess you missed it. The young vote isn’t turning out for Bernie. Joe has EXPANDED the dem vote. Nice try, though.
Are you making fun of somebody's stutter? Is that how low you have fallen?
I’ve watched too many vids from /r/prematurecelebration to know you don’t declare yourself a winner till you cross the finish line.  Everybody stay focus and campaign like the fate of the world depends on it ... because it does.
Rhode Island is still Bernie.
Thank you! That's amazing.
I think WA will take a few days to be called. I think Missouri and Mississippi will be called at closing and that Michigan might to if Biden performs as well as he's expected. ID and ND I have no clue
Totally agree but, at the same time, we need everyone to know that we're leading. Most people that go out to vote won't vote for someone that they know is a loser or has no path to victory. People should get EXCITED to vote for Joe. I was excited to cast my ballot for Joe and he won my state. I got to be part of history. I think that's pretty cool.
At this point a narrow win either way doesn't really matter. The only way for Sanders to overtake Biden is by winning BIG in states like Washington and I think it's clear that will not happen.  Whether WA gives Sanders or Biden a net handful more delegates doesn't matter when Biden is likely blowing Sanders out in Missouri and Mississippi and racking up a delegate lead of dozens in both.
Absolutely you’re right. We should all get excited in Joe and political forecasts showing him in the lead are a great way. But memories of 2016 still haunt me and I don’t want that to repeat. So let’s channel that excitement into action and not be complacent and take nothing for granted.  Edit. I think we’re really on the same page. I’m just more a glass half empty person ...
It's less about delegates and more about morale. Biden winning every single state tomorrow would be crushing to the Sanders campaign, and would likely give Biden the boost he needs to win every state again next Tuesday
Totally agree! On the same page. I'm super curious about Michigan because my hunch has always been that people didn't vote for Bernie- they voted against Hillary.
Agreed. Momentum is important and the more dominating Biden looks, the easier the primary will go.  I think a lot of people want this over very quickly so we can all focus on Trump. Battling it out until the convention would be a massive distraction.
Exactly. I just want to move on to Trump, this primary is turning into a bloodbath because of Sanders
Senator Kyrsten Sinema endorses Biden ahead of Arizona primary
That makes both the current Senator of AZ and  her future colleague Mark Kelly both backing Joe.   I have high hopes (Pete reference) for AZ this fall.  A f\*cking Astronaut in the Senate is so cool!
I think Joe’s going to get a lot of Arizona Republican votes. Arizonans remember their beloved Senator John McCain and that Joe gave one of his eulogies. They would love to trounce the nasty rat occupying the WH.
Yo that's my Senator.
Love Sinema, hope to give her a new colleague this year with Kelly. Both of them have endorsed Joe, so along with Pete's endorsement it's getting harder for me to not to jump on the Joe train.
Hillary lost AZ by fewer than 100,000 votes.  Biden has a great chance
Thank you, Senator Sinema!!
This should help with the primaries. I assume besides endorsement, they help with local outreach for primaries and get the vote out.
It says something that the democrats that are in purple areas endorse Biden and only those in super safe blue ones endorse Sanders.
Bill Nelson served in Congress for years.  And John Glenn before him.   Honestly, I think this current Congress is probably the first one in a long time where there isn’t an astronaut in the Senate.
[This is EXACTLY why](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/483510-mcsally-ties-democratic-rival-kelly-to-sanders-in-new-ad) our nominee is important for down ballot races.
As a former Arizonan...the idea of it turning blue makes me so giddy. I did love McCain though.
I think Biden will do well in AZ— with one counterpoint: Bernie has been doing better with Latinos/Hispanics. So, it’s not going to be easy. Uncle Joe has millions more in just the last week (around $20m I’d guess) and hopefully has been building out his infrastructure since last week.
She’s great. I love her!
Vote for Mark Kelly!
God I love her. She’s my idol. I don’t even live in AZ, but with family there and a longtime visitor I still love seeing what she’s done to the Phoenix metro area and the rest of the state.
I forgot about John Glenn!! I had no idea Bill Nelson was an Astronaut.  Just read about him and Jack Garn training as sitting Senators to go to space.  Well it will be good to bring one back then!
McCain was the last Republican to serve in the Senate. Maybe even in elected office.
Bernie seems to be targeting the Yuma/Nogales area, don’t forget the Phoenix metro area still has tons of non-latino democratic voters.
romney
Naaa. He's trying to claw back from the depths of the abyss though.
Biden to hold 'virtual' campaign events amid coronavirus outbreak
I really like this idea! I also like that it looks like Joe thought of this before Bernie
I love this idea. I think campaigns should do this more of this stuff in general. Especially for people who can’t go to rallies.
Bring back fireside chats dammit!😅
I reeeeally want Bloomberg to buy him some tv spots.
Pete was on the usual shows the other day talking about how the virus needs to make campaigns rethink the definition of what "campaigning" means. This is likely a reflection of that, considering he's part of the campaign.
Brilliant idea. I can just see it now.  'Ice cream hour with Joe Biden'
Will this be the new normal moving forward?
Good.
Live YouTube streams of Joe tend to be filled with toxic Bernard brothers and Trump supporters.
I like it
Responsible thing to do!
I really appreciate Biden is doing this. Shows me he cares about the safety of his staff and voters.   It's going to be very hard to campaign during the pandemic. Hope everything goes alright. Health care is more important now than ever.
God he's looking sooo Presidential recently. I think he's been getting some great coaching following his surge. I'm excited for President Biden!
I'm in fucking West Virginia. You think anybody other than Trump ever shows up over here?
I think something like that will be needed for Americans to regain trsut in the government
Sounds like something Pete would think up. He and his staff were lightyears ahead of all the other campaigns when it came to digital ....
I attended a virtual event during Pete’s campaign! It was nice
Most likely. And if Trump keeps holding large rallies it will create a stark contrast between how each of them value American’s safety.
Online events were a HUGE part of Beto's 2018 success. Impromptu online town halls are surprisingly effective in maintaining contact with supporters, answering questions and providing a level of transparency and authenticity that's hard to come by otherwise.  I hope it becomes a trend for Democratic candidates.
I hope in future years that we don’t go completely online.  It’s a great way to reach young people and those who can afford internet access, but it’s a great way to lose older and rural voters.
It doesn’t need to be open to comments, a curated question format would work perfectly for a town hall type deal. Joe needs to focus on policy anyways as he transitions to the general.
He was also big on holding conference calls with supporters.
Trump is going to struggle with this. He loves having his ego stroked at rallies. All those red hats cheering for him...that is this man’s lifeblood 😂
Also, speaking of new ways to campaign, never forget Beto livestreaming his underwear folding. Never forget.
It's also a great way to make it possible for people with disabilities, who may not be able to deal with the long lines/wait times/lack of sight lines, etc. be able to feel a part of a campaign.
Do you have a video or screen shot of this haha
Fair point, but it still cuts out rural and low-income voters who may have little to no internet access.
[I think this was it](https://www.facebook.com/betoorourke/videos/folding-laundry/2161561547188760/).....unless he's livestreamed his laundry multiple times, which brings up a whole new set of questions.

Kamala Harris to campaign with Biden on Monday in Detroit
**Detroit, MI: Get Out the Vote Event with Joe Biden**  >California Sen. Kamala Harris will campaign in Michigan for Joe Biden on Monday, appearing with him at a 7 p.m. rally at Renaissance High School.  >The event is open to the public, and people are being asked to **[RSVP here.](https://www.mobilize.us/joebiden/event/259596/)**
/u/pyrojoe121 is it time for that Captain Marvel entrance???
Makes sense.  Washington is a mail-in state so the die is largely cast at this point.
Sounds like something a running mate would do
Pete is campaigning in Michigan as well, right?
VP candidate Kamala?
[removed]
I'd like to point out that Joe and Kamala are campaigning at a high school in a residential area, not downtown. They're meeting people where they actually live.
When this many excellent politicians join you, you know you have a winner  ! This is why VP Biden was always the best bet going into 2020.
Post this to arr politics and watch it get downvoted and replaced by another 5 Jesse Jackson posts.
I’m so unbelievably thrilled! I’ve been fortunate to see Kampala speak in person twice and she’s incredible. This is the endorsement I’ve been hoping and waiting for!  Edit: Kamala is what I meant to type, as shamed by the above post.
Finally!  This is what I kept posting before Super Tuesday (incl Cali), where is the Harris endorsement.   I guess they strategically spread out the endorsements it out to keep the hype going
God say what you will but this campaign's communications strategy has been LIT this week. Having her campaign on Monday publicly for the first time ENSURES she's covered wall to wall the night before the election!
I'm working out how to make a coherent narrative for it. I have a good one for Warren, but she hasn't endorsed yet and I know I said I'd do Kamala first. I may have to shift some characters around.
Idaho is Bernie’s firewall.  :-)
 The large majority of CA mail in ballots weren't cast before the day of the election.
Bloomberg's Jennifer Epstein posited that this might be a "test run" similar to Hillary and Tim Kaine's Virginia rally during the 2016 primary: [https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/1236641587825913864](https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/1236641587825913864)
Naw, I think she adds little value to the ticket.    But she’ll make a great surrogate during the campaign.
TBH, Amy, Kamala, Pete and other endorsers are also campaigning for Biden. So, we can’t look too much into one person at this point. Although, I like the idea!
Would love that !
Or what the other ex-candidates are doing. At this rate Biden has four running mates

Well backup idea for Kamala - Valkyrie, also a pretty badass character
He is going to get all of the Forest Rangers in West Yellowstone.
Shes AA...she adds lot.of value. The vp doesnt need to always be from a swing state
There are definately better options for VP than her.
[removed]
[removed]
Spell check error. My apologies. Certainly you know what I meant. Your need to point out an error was motivated by what exactly?
That is actually exactly what I was thinking for the one where Warren is Marvel.
Biden has no problem with the black vote.  And he’ll take her home state of CA easily.  Her base is his base.  She’d make a better AG than a running mate.
Stacey Abrams is AA and is from a swing state she also has little baggage and is also naturally charismatic and presents a good contrast to Biden.
[removed]
[removed]
I don’t know, I like geography and I’m depressed because I really don’t like her and now everyone’s pushing her for VP.
Awesome, also while I have your attention, gotta get my Senator (Senima) and Congressman (Gallego) in there ;)
This, I want her to bring the fury down.  Other then to appease some people she makes zero sense as a VP.  It needs to be a women from a Blue Wall state.
He doesnt but she would energize that vote liken2008 numbers.  She or amy ..i would be totally fine.
I wouldn’t take the black vote for granted. Hillary did better with the black vote in the primary than Biden has so far, but lower than expected black turnout in PA, MI and WI were among the many factors that cost her the election.
I hope he brings Loretta Lynch back for AG.
Stacey couldn't win GA. I live here, and, while she ran a good campaign, GA is not yet a swing state. She made it close, but she wasn't going to win even without Kemp's shady term as Sec of State during the election. It's better if she stays an advocate for getting people registered to vote and fighting disenfranchisement. She should work with some of the black representatives in GA and focus on getting people out to vote to flip the Senate seats first.  *That's* where Stacey would do the most good. Not as Joe's potential VP. She would be his Sarah Palin.
She is unknown and has little exp. Swing state yes but risk factor high. I wont mind her aw well but they need to vet her.
[removed]
 I didn’t push her for anything. I said I enjoyed her speeches I attended. Buck up, buttercup. It’s about the coalition.
Amy seems to make a bit more sense, other than that an all white ticket isn’t ideal for some people. Amy’s endorsement had such an impact on Joe and she could really affect things in the Midwest.
You do realize Stacey has created an organization called *Fair Fight*. She has been responsible for registering tens of thousands of people. Stacey also made Georgia competitive after being deep red for many years. She would be a great pick for VP, and is much smarter and more intelligent than Sarah Palin. Also her on **the top of the ticket would do a lot to help us win the Georgia Special** as compared to the low visibility work you propose.
[removed]
I follow GA politics well. I know GA well. I live here. My family has been in GA politics for generations. We are not yet purple. Even when the Dems did hold GA before 2000, they were Dixiecrats. I'd be shocked if we have a Dem governor or go for the Dem nom in the presidency. Could potentially be in a few years, but we're not yet. The Dems are concentrated in Atlanta, Gwinnett, Athens, & Savannah. Those areas are growing steadily, but they need to spread out further if Dems want to actually make inroads in GA. Stacey doesn't help Joe at all in areas of his campaign that he doesn't already have.   Black vote? He already has it, and Obama will ensure he doesn't need to do much more than he already has.  Progressives? They generally either don't vote or will go with him once he take the nom and Liz & everyone else endorses him. Besides, there are other progressives in the field with more experience and better images than Abrams. In general, Abrams is looked at as a sore loser in GA because she never conceded the election. Whether she was viewed as right or wrong across the nation is irrelevant because it's the GA electorate that voted on her. She won't flip GA. They rejected her once, they'll do it again.  Stacey doesn't help with suburban women or the union voters, which is where Joe needs to focus to win in the key battlegrounds of Penn, Wisconsin, Florida, & Michigan. If he's smart, he'll focus on someone who *will* energize those demographics even more than he already has been. I don't know who the best candidate is for that, but I know Stacey isn't it.  Stacey's experience in getting people registered to vote and pushing for better voting conditions is where she will do the best work for Joe. Have her advise the campaign and help get people to the polls to go after the Senate seats. Let her run the ground game in GA. That's where she'll do the best. Even if we don't go blue, and I'd be shocked if we do, pushing the RNC & Trump to spend money here takes money away from states like Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, & Michigan, and that's where Joe needs to focus in order to win.
I'll keep this short and simple. Democratic growth in Georgia isn't just in those places you mentioned Northern Gwinett, parts of Forsyth and even **Cobb** which were longtime Republican strongholds voted Hillary in 2016. Stacey Abrams won Georgia in 2018 she would be Governor if it weren't for voter purges and voter suppression.  The goal **is not to win Georgia on the Presidential level it's to win one of two Senate Seats and Flip GA-07.** Not to mention **winning black votes in the rust belt and the sunbelt in Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Pittsbutgh, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and Detroit,** Stacey Abrams does both and will present a formidable VP candidate, another option for the Latino vote is Catherine Cortez Masto and if your theory is preferred then Amy Klobuchar would be better.
My one question with regard to the black votes in the rust belt: What does she bring that Obama wouldn't when he starts pounding the pavement? Obama is the largest AA political figure since MLK. Stacey would be redundant. That's my point. She doesn't bring anything that wouldn't be accomplished and probably even better than she could. Practically speaking, she doesn't help in any demographic needed.   Stacey didn't win. That narrative is exactly why she's seen as a sore loser and mostly rejected by the GA electorate. Kemp was shady as hell and I'm sympathetic to Stacey and her voters (I even voted for her), but there's no evidence any votes were altered or not counted once they were issued. Even after Kemp was smacked multiple times by Federal judges (and I'm unaware of any evidence they disregarded the Judges' rulings), he still won.  \*Everything after this is my experience and observations strictly about GA if anyone doesn't want to read further\*  I lived in Forsyth County for 10 years until I moved to Atlanta for work. Forsyth County is one of the whitest and wealthiest counties in the *nation*. Not long ago, they were top 20 though I haven't checked to see if they're still there. It's still solidly R. Some poll stations may have went blue because the South end is beginning to bring in more AAs, but Forsyth county was still solidly red in 2018 and will remain so in 2020. Hell, Cumming voted out their mayor of 40+ years riding the wave of "Out with career politicians" that Trump championed. (Funny story, I used to work with his girlfriend that got him and his admin in hot water with the FBI. She was shocked he lost even though she enthusiastically voted for Trump.) They have had some of the wackiest state reps too. The guy who ran from FoCo for the governor's race was called 'the poor man's Trump' and got smacked by Cagle and Kemp. Dude even tried to take political offers to the news and just failed tremendously.  Kemp has even gotten into hot water with Trump and his fans by going against Trump's recommendation and not appointing Doug Collins, who Trump personally wanted, to fill Isakson's Senate spot. He appointed [Kelly Loeffler](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/us/politics/kelly-loeffler-georgia-senate.html), who Trump was opposed to.  David Perdue is also one of the more [popular](https://247wallst.com/special-report/2019/11/05/americas-most-and-least-popular-senators/4/) Senators amongst his constituents. Flipping that seat is going to be **very** hard. Tbh, I'm split on the Dem ticket between Ossoff & Tomlinson. Both of them have very good endorsements and decent history. I'll probably go Tomlinson bc she actually has elected official experience though I did like Ossoff's campaign for representative. But I don't see either of them beating Perdue, if I'm being honest.
First and foremost are best chance is in the Georgia special against Kelly Loeffler and Doug Collins. We have great candidate for a state like Georgia in [Dr. Raphael Warnock ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://warnockforgeorgia.com/&ved=2ahUKEwie7t_tgIzoAhURl3IEHe2jCMMQFjAhegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw2rOZi-gLli0KROxjqG-jHm).  Oh yeah Forsyth is way in the future over time it's  exurban and was a county that has a deeply racist past. However **margins matter** and things are getting *closer.*    You're also forgetting that there has *never been a woman VP ever regardless of race*. She's a good campaigner and let me tell you if we don't complete we won't win we are trying to win redder states in the Senate. Like Montana, Alaska, and Kansas.
Former Sanders Supporter for Joe
Hi - welcome! You’ll find many of us are new here having supported other candidates. We formed a big tent and we’re kicking ass  I’m so glad you made it here
Welcome! I hope we see more Sanders supporters over here if Biden wins the primary. We need to get Trump out! Biden’s plans are just as progressive as Bernie’s, and I think are a bit more implementable and realistic. I’ve been fans of Amy, Pete, Warren, and Biden and am new to this group too. Go, Joe!
Welcome! A lot of us have supported Sanders but are now Team Joe!
I've come around to the not-far-left side earlier, but once Pete dropped out I actually took a look at Biden's policies. They're rock-solid. I'm now excited about him. I'm also excited by what could happen. Maybe he runs alongside our first female VP! Maybe he and Obama energize crowds like I saw in the midterms and we take the Senate and keep the House!  I live in New York. Progressive legislation stalled for years, but then we flipped the state senate. Suddenly, tons of progressive legislation got passed.
Welcome!
Sounds like you really went on a journey.  We’re glad to have you.  If Biden were won I’d loove to fly to the inauguration.  If a rock won tho I’d unironically pop a champagne to A Rock 2020 too!
Welcome! Team Pete to Team Biden supporter here! ✋ Love seeing everyone coming together. #TeamDemocrats!
Greetings and welcome!
Welcome to the team!  So many of us have come from different campaigns — We’re one big melting pot now, and that’s sort of cool!
Welcome! I truly admire your open-mindedness.  You might be happy to know that Biden strongly advocates for free community college too! In fact, that was one of his talking points during Tuesday's speech. :)
I wish the media spent more time talking about his policy platform. It's not as flashy as M4A but it's really well thought-out and many of his ideas are *legitimately progressive.* It's too bad that the primary has basically become a referendum on Bernie's proposals because it stops people from being able to get excited for what Biden has to offer.   He's not just a return to the status quo, he's offering real change. Hopefully it'll come out more in the general.
Welcome, I also voted Bernie in 2016 primary, and voted Hillary in election. I got little disappointed in Bernie because I felt he did not put his full weight after Hillary for whatever reason. Then I started looking into his policies this election and math just does not add up. Finally his base’s association with ANTIFA made me not to pick Bernie this election. Biden is the one who can unify party and bring neutrals against Trump, who must be defeated for the good of this country.
Great!
Welcome!
Welcome! I’m a fellow Sanders 2016 supporter, although I supported O’Malley originally, until he dropped out. Also, I was too young to vote. I turned 18 in February 2017. This election I started out in January 2019 supporting Warren, then I switched to Castro in February, then back to Warren in September, and I switched to Biden in November. Sanders is definitely left of where I am, but his foreign policy is my single biggest issue with him. In 2016 it was less known and the Venezuela thing hadn’t happened yet, but even knowing everything I know now I still would support him over Clinton. Anyway, I wrote this little essay about a month ago on why I think Biden is the best choice. I’ve posted it way too many times in comments and stuff, but here it is in case you want to read it.  Biden is the strongest candidate on foreign policy. He has a deep well of experience simply unmatched by other candidates. As I’m sure you’ll agree, Trump has done serious damage to our foreign relations. This is a uniquely difficult time in the world, with democracy under threat from the rise of authoritarian nations and Trump has sided with dictators and has isolated us from our allies. Biden knows these leaders. He has spent time with these leaders. More than that, he truly understands the importance of NATO and democracy promotion. He understands that the actions taken in the next four years could likely determine the course of this century in human rights and global affairs. He is particularly strong on China. Biden has spoken with passion on the treatment of the Uyghurs and will make human rights an important issue in US-China relations, as it should be. He is the only candidate with a detailed plan for responding to a potential Chinese invasion of autonomous Hong Kong. He supports reviving something similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but with more worker’s rights protections and anti-outsourcing measures to create a powerful trading block of Pacific democracies to compete with China, and he has stated a willingless to consider options up to and including sanctions and economic isolation to pressure the Chinese government. He knows that a strong America is good for the world, and that the world’s democracies must unite to combat the tyrrany and corruption of nations such as Russia, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. He supports using our considerable soft power, I.E. diplomatic influence, to push for justice. This is also the only true path to lasting peace, as democracies don’t go to war against other democracies. He rightly has strong reservations about using our military to solve problems that do not have a military solution or could be solved through diplomacy. He strongly opposed and argued against President Obama’s troop surge.   Outside of foreign policy, he has the longest and strongest record of actually passing progressive legislation. He wrote the Violence Against Women Act. He helped pass the Assault Weapons Ban. As Vice President, he got our troops out of Iraq, pushed Obamacare through congress, helped negotiate the Iran Nuclear Deal, and was instrumental in various budget negotiations. He has deep relationships on Capitol Hill and the experience to get his proposals passed. He will add a public option, which will help put us on the path to a single payer system, which I support as the eventual goal. He will make the United States a global leader on climate change, creating thousands of new jobs. He will push for justice on issues from race to LGBT rights and more. He will appoint judges who understand that the constitution guarantees our rights, including the right for women to make their own decisions about their bodies.   Furthermore, I would also posit that, in such uniquely challenging times in the world, now more than ever we need to elect a candidate who knows how to restore our standing in the world, and also that as the president has a particularly large amount of control over foreign policy that this issue is especially critical in the presidential race, as opposed to congressional races, which are less important for foreign policy. Take health care. Let’s say that you support enacting medicare for all immediately. electing a president who supports that does not ensure that that would get passed by congress, while electing a president who supports a public option instead does not ensure that negotiations with congress won’t result in medicare for all instead. The president has the power to sign and veto legislation, urge congress, and push for their positions. On foreign policy, though, electing a president who, let’s say, opposes making human rights a focus of U.S.-China relations almost certainly assures that they won’t be, while electing a president who supports that almost certainly assues that they will be.   Also, it’s what people do when they think that no one is watching that provides the best view of their true nature. Biden’s true nature shows that he cares about people more than pretty much any politician. Here’s an example of what he does when he thinks that nobody is watching. From the very beginning of his political career, every time he ran for anything, this woman in Delaware would send him a $25 check. Not that long ago, she died. Joe was reading the newspaper and saw her name in the obituaries section. He had never met her, but he felt compelled to pay his respects. He went for a shiva call (Jewish mourning practice). There were no cameras, this was not a public relations stunt, and Joe never mentioned it. The story was brought to light by her family.   Finally, Biden understands that America has rarely, if ever, lived up to anything anywhere near the lofty ideals that we hold, but he understands that there was a sense of pride and unity, optimism and determination, and idealism that has been lost. He wants to restore that, but as an inclusive vision that actually lives up to our aspirations and leaves no one behind. This is quite possibly our last chance to recapture that knowledge of what America can be, that vision of what our destiny can be, that was advanced by such figures as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Frank Church, and Walter Mondale. Restoring that vision in the next few years could ensure it’s survival, while I fear that failing to bring that vision back now will mean that it could be gone forever. No one else running focuses on much beyond their individual policies. Many say they can unite us, but no one provides the unifying vision that we had, that we need. This is what makes America special. This vision is Joe Biden’s vision (From his website)-Joe’s Vision:  “We are in a battle for the soul of America. It’s time to remember who we are. We’re Americans: tough and resilient. We choose hope over fear. Science over fiction. Truth over lies. And unity over division. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor. We are the United States of America. And together, there is not a single thing we cannot do.”  Joe also states on his website, “Our best days still lie ahead.” Let’s elect someone with the experience, tenacity, and vision to make this statement a reality. It’s not yet too late. If we work together, we can do it.
“Welcome, former internet bully who believed in fantasy-policies that have no basis in reality.”  Jesus, I’m a Warren voter looking for a home, and the way this sub rips on progressives as being uneducated hateful basement dwelling internet trolls is hardly the way to get everyone on board.  Even someone saying they’re a former Sanders supporter just means this sub gets another opportunity to insult anyone who’s not neoliberal.
lol this reads so much like a terribly written puff piece. So much use of Biden's talking points, and slamming Sanders' supporters even though that has nothing to do with Sanders' himself, especially after he disavowed them.  Pretty transparent, not at all sincere. Try harder.
[removed]
Big tent! Big tent!  Sorry, I'm just really into the idea.
Absolutely about getting Trump out. That and flipping the Senate are so important!
how?
> Maybe he and Obama energize crowds like I saw in the midterms and we take the Senate and keep the House!  God I hope so. The truth is no Democrat will be able to accomplish nearly as much with Mitch McConnell blocking things as they can if we take back the Senate. A Democratic legislature is even more important than which Democrat takes the Presidency.
I thought he supported Hillary pretty wholeheartedly in the general.
Did I miss something? I haven't seen anyone attack me here. There are some comments in response to a coupe of Sanders supporters who attacked me for switching over, but I haven't gotten anyone insulting me.
I’m a Bernie supporter and I said I’m even still voting for him in the primary because I still align with his platform more, but ready and willing to support Biden in the general. I’ve gotten nothing but love here.
I'm sorry if this is the impression you have of our sub. Please report any hateful comments to the mods. We pride ourselves on being civil.
We welcome anyone who comes here in good-faith. You will find some discussion about our concerns with the small but very real and active subset of Sanders supporters who do engage in cyberbullying and trolling, but we certainly understand that most Sanders supporters are not like that. We don't have anything against progressives, in fact, most of us are progressives. Being a moderate doesn't necessarily mean you don't agree with progressive goals, but believe that the best way to achieve those goals is through incremental progress rather than trying to achieve everything at once. Anyways, sorry if you got the wrong idea from this sub. You and any other progressives are certainly welcome here.
What? I haven’t ever seen anything like that here. I supported Sanders in 2016. Everyone is welcome here.
Just one data point, but I consider myself a "progressive with establishment DNA," as someone put it. I voted for Warren in the primary here, but I've love Joe since he was in the Senate, and I'm hoping that progressives stay in the fight to encourage the nominee to push the agenda forward.   I can't see the comment you referenced, but I'm sorry if you've gotten any hostile treatment. The mods here are very good about squashing that, and I was **really** impressed that they also adopted Pete's "Rules of the Road." This is a big tent party for a reason.
I don’t know what to tell you. It’s how I’ve felt the past couple days. I still would prefer M4A and there are still ideals of Sanders’ I’d prefer, but overall I’ve been turned off by a lot of stuff.  And you can say Sanders supporters don’t have anything to do with him, but if it makes people not like the movement because of them then it ends up mattering. At least to me.  Again, I really don’t know what to tell you.
You comment appears to me to contain a substantial amount of malarkey. Please be advised that generally we consider the acceptable limit for malarkey to be 0 parts per million.
I hated in 2016 when Trump supporters used that line of logic on Clinton. People change over decades and I don't think anyone who ran down the hall wearing a rainbow flag to celebrate *Obergefell v. Hodges* was opposing gay marriage at the time.  But I'll copy what I've said elsewhere about the "mean" thing.  People don't like to be bullied. That's a fact of life. We are not all computers who make our decisions based entirely on the whims of what the cold hard reality is. We have emotions. So if you have two people, one of them you agree on 80% of things, but the supporters are all being assholes to you, and one you agree on 50% of things, but the supporters are being warm to you, then you are more likely to go to the second one. This is why the way the message is presented is as important as the message itself.  And here's the thing, neither Sanders nor many people on here seem to get that and that's a devastating thing when it comes to actually implementing the plans. Let's assume Sanders won and had a majority of the House and Senate as Democrats. Let's say he had 53 Dems in the Senate. If four Dems don't agree with M4A then he can't get it off the ground.  Sanders is not good at compromising his vision and seems to think the rest of the party will just fall in line behind him, but he will have to work with all of these centrist democrats that he has spent the past year burning bridges with.  So as much as supporters can go on and on about 70k people dying a year, bullying others is the exact wrong way to accomplish anything. Sanders supporters have spend months calling candidates a snake or a rat and now, when those candidates drop out, expect the supporters to line up behind him because of those 70k people a year, completely ignoring that the tactics they used burnt bridges in the exact same ways Sanders has burnt bridges with the very moderates he would need to get M4A through.  I don't think we're going to get anywhere if people keep driving away potential allies and burning bridges. It's more than just some Sanders' supporters being "mean." It's some of his supporters are making misogynistic, homophobic attacks on other Democrats right now (not decades ago) and I cannot see myself being a part of that revolution any longer.
Sanders actually opposed gay marriage too, as opposed to Biden lobbying Obama to support gay marriage, but you guys conveniently leave out that fact. Just like you gloss over the fact that your candidate has been in the senate, a position that arguably has more chance of getting legislation passed, for over 30 years, and yet has got nothing done. And the fact that your candidate so barely believed in the democratic system he didn't even vote until he could vote for himself.   We don't dislike Sanders because his supporters are "mean", but because they actively tear down and harass other candidates and their supporters, spread lies, and act like non-supporters are evil and want people to die, while gloating and trying to pack . You don't see that with any other one of the candidates - our communities not only self-police, but our candidates don't talk in a way that demeans our opponents and encourages the sort of vitriol that gets directed at us from Sanders supporters
VOTE FOR MY CANDIDATE OR YOU'RE A BIGOTED, RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC MORON.   WHY IS BERNIE LOSING?!?!
Biden was the one who forced Obama to support gay marriage and the segregation talking point is a flat out lie.
That's what it means to be a Democrat :)
Me too! Seeing the supporters of different candidates come together on here and Twitter has been one of the most wholesome things I've seen in a long time. We really are stronger together.
Because we saw the positives in Sanders but as all of the nominees adopted his best ideas, we saw that there were clearly better candidates to unity our party and most importantly defeat trump
I would have supported pretty much anyone against Hillary.
Agreed, without the Senate, nothing will get done. Mitch McConnell won't even hold votes on anything. This is the problem with focusing on big policy promises over the  ability to expand the electorate. It doesn't matter what a president promises, if we don't have the Senate, we can't get legislation passed, especially legislation from someone who calls themselves a socialist. Republicans will gleefuly obstruct everything they do and feel justified because they are "fighting against a socialist takeover", or however they would spin it.
If we want to take the Senate, one critical race is Montana. After months of urging, Steve Bullock has finally decided to challenge Steve Daines! He’s the sitting 2 term Governor, and won reelection on the same day that Trump carried the state by 20 points. He’s a strong advocate for getting dark money out of politics, fighting climate change, protecting Obamacare, and keeping public lands in public hands. He has worked across the aisle to bring real progressive change to Montana, building on the work of his predecessor, Brian Schweitzer. He will bring common sense values to Washington. Please consider donating to his campaign once he officially enters the race in a few days.
You are absolutely welcome here! I haven’t seen anything like what this user is describing.
They would lap this up if you'd switched to Bernie, but because you don't support a man whose actions and ideals ENCOURAGE bullying others, you must be a corporate shill. It's crazy how we all write fluff pieces, except for the hundreds of Sanders supporters who posed as Pete supporters to try to convince other supporters to switch to Sanders when Pete dropped out - if you have to lie to get people to support your candidate, you might be doing something wrong
There's a difference between being a senator and president, is there not? I fear for democracy in the world when biden gets the nomination. He can't even keep track of who his wife is, how's he going to handle all the mudslinging from the orange clown. His track record to improve QoL for the average joe is abyssmal.  I hope you're right and he can beat trump, I just doubt he can hold his own against vicious attacks from faux news because he's so inconsistent.
No joke, I had kids on campus be like "this must be rigged, Sanders is losing" and as a Buttigieg to Biden supporter, it took so much willpower to restrain myself from telling them that outside of their echo-chambers, they have been outright abusive to other campaigns and dismissive of narratives that don't fit their own, so of course people are turned off of Sanders
[removed]
>We really are stronger together.  Now that's a phrase that warms my heart.
We saw that the integrity and word of the other candidates meant nothing when they endorsed Biden. Biden stands against change, against M4A, against climate reform, against fixing anything.
It's not like I was even posting on Politics or a Sanders sub. What motivation would I have to lie on the JoeBiden sub? For the sweet 64 Karma I got so far?   Oh well, it's not a big deal. Some people don't want to believe others and there's nothing you can do about that. As long as we all move in one direction this November I'll be thrilled.
So is Sanders. I fear for democracy if Sanders gets the nomination, not because he's "inconsistent" (although he is, and ineffective as well, compared to Biden or literally any other candidate) but because then democracy will have been reduced to "who can yell the loudest and bully the other candidates into submission" and that's no longer a democracy.

Have you ever even looked at his policies? Because that is a bunch of malarkey
What? He stands for bridge-building progressivism, for a public option, which is more achievable than medicare for all, and, unlike every other “moderate” candidate, supports most of the Green New Deal.
Where are Biden’s policies on M4A and Climate Change?
Here’s an overview on his policies on healthcare and climate, as well as many others. He wants a public option and a progressive climate agenda including a carbon tax and a focus on nuclear    https://politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/joe-biden/
Thanks to everyone who's joined, /r/JoeBiden has become one of the fastest-growing subreddits! We've more than doubled in size this week so far, growing 30.71% on Super Tuesday alone!
Especially huge shout-out to the users and moderators of /r/Pete_Buttigieg and /r/BaemyKlobuchar, and /r/BetoORourke (née /r/Beto2020)! Thank you for growing this subreddit not only in quantity of subscribers, but in quality too!
Thanks to the mods for keeping this place civil in spite of our rapid growth.
Definitely props to the community and mods for allowing actual civil discourse and not just having a free for all of blind zealotry like certain other subreddits.
Proud to be one of the new subscribers. 😊
New subscriber, and proud to say that #ImWithJoe (You know where my heart was back in 2016)  Can I just say how the “establishment” narrative pisses me off. NO. Voters deserve better. Biden won super Tuesday because the Voters showed up for him.   American voters deserve better. They don’t deserve to be treated as if they don’t have minds of their own and can be manipulated by the “establishment” and the “mainstream media”. Just no.   Biden won Super Tuesday because Voters believed in his cause, not because they were told to do so.  Super Tuesday was a wake up call to never, NEVER, underestimate the moderate vote.
I would have voted for anyone who got the nomination and wouldn't have lost any sleep over it, but I was Biden or Buttigieg from the very beginning. I can own the fact that I'm a neoliberal shill; the "establishment" narrative leaves me cold. I want the establishment. I want the *old* establishment, the one we had before Trump decided to "drain the swamp." I'm from Florida. I *like* the swamp, it has snowy egrets. Well, forgive me the slightly tortured metaphor, but as awful as this sounds, "opaque bureaucracy riddled with power politics, venal careerists, and a soupcon of graft and nepotism, all overseen from on high by elected officials with strong democratic mandates who give out broad directives" is, alas, unfortunately, *the most effective and just political system in the history of the world.* Bureaucratic politics is the price of having people who know what they're doing, and it's what we've got. I trust Biden to work with this machine more than I trust anyone else to destroy and remake it.  All I really want is a new version of the Obama administration, ideally with a more compliant Congress.  Look, I have two big issues. Issue number 1 is the environment and the climate, but I don't think any Democrat really has a strong pull-away advantage on that. Issue number 2 is diplomacy and foreign affairs. Trump has spent the last four years radiating hostility towards the rest of the world, turning friends into enemies and boosting the profile of our actual enemies. First and foremost, I trust Joe to find common ground with the rest of the democratic world and rebuild our connections with our allies. (I would like a president who would stand up to Saudi Arabia and demand they begin reforms, but let's get real - nobody was ever going to do that.)  And people bring up his gaffes, his clownish moments. So what? Look at the White House; clowns are what's on the menu, and I would rather have a gentle clown who can laugh at himself than a cruel one who laughs at the misfortunes of others.
Pete supporter, joined and donated.
Here as part of the buttibump!
I love to see such this increase in activity here.  I remember when posts would get three upvotes and now it's really hopping.
Newbie checking in. This place is like a breath of fresh air.
This place is awesome!  Thanks mods!  I can’t wait to start welcoming those Sanders supporter, we have a lot of work ahead of us and we’ll need everyone to stop Trump!
Everyone coming together to rally and defeat Trump is truly inspiring. It's been a rough start to the week for many. But Super Tuesday has renewed my hope! 🍦😎
\* \~ \* \~ UNITY \~ \* \~ \*
Sub-3k subscriber checking in! Glad to see all the new activity! Y'all are going to make me actually work for my mod spot now 😁
Welp, here I am, ex-Warren supporter. I suspect there will be more of us.
Im just glad bernie lost so go joe i guess
Joined on Super Tuesday. Still a Bernie fan but will back Joe if I absolutely have to
Thanks!  I’m enjoying being a new supporter   This feels like a movement popped up overnight
Joe Biden, more like joe "bad"en. Bad um tsss! Thank you thank you!
1,489 subscribers yesterday! Let's get to 10k today!
Gonna hit 10k soon! High Energy!
I didn't even know this site had Biden supporters. Lol. Thankfully here we are.   You would have thought Bernie was already president based on reddit. Turns out it's not even close in the real world.   Biden 2020.
Just dropping in to say congrats on the super Tuesday win. You guys crushed commie Bernie. You just might be able to pull this off and take your party back from the progressive crazies.
Welcome! Make yourself cozy and pour yourself a cone of ice cream!
💙💛+🍦😎 = 🇺🇸💪
Welcome!
Former Pete supporter here, I donated to Joe Biden already and really want to stay active politically!!  So far, so good!! Y’all seem like a very nice bunch!! Still healing but I’m not letting my guard down !! glad to join forces as we have to defeat Trump!!
Isn't this amazing!!
Warren’s ideas will live on. I for one really like the plans she presented.
Welcome aboard-- you all had an incredible campaign and Elizabeth Warren is amazing.
Welcome!
🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦❤
I wish Biden the best
Thank you!
If you're short on cash and want to help the Biden (+Pete+Amy+Beto+....) campaign, consider text- and phone-banking!
I'm for Bernie, but I came to this subreddit just to learn a bit more about Biden and his supporters.  I'm hearing a lot about toxic Bernie supporters, and perhaps it's because I've been in an echo chamber, but I just haven't witnessed this toxicity personally.  Regardless, I'll vote Biden if he does win the primary.
Thank you and welcome to the fold.  We're building a big coalition here and you're very much welcome.
bernie supporter here. no matter what, if joe gets the nomination, i will campaign full force for him. bernie respects him, and all his supporters should as well.
We should vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is. Why? The Supreme court is on the line. If we get 4 more years of Trump, it will hand him the courts for decades to come. It will have a lasting effect on gun and immigration reform, healthcare, equal rights, the criminal justice system etc. We must fight for those kids locked in cages at the border, the kids of Sandy Hook and Parkland, the senseless murders of LGBT, Jewish, Muslim, black, Latino communities. We can’t afford 4 more years of chaos and corruption. Let’s put our pride aside and vote for the voiceless in their honor. We owe them that much America.
I'm a Canadian who favours Bernie, but I do have a lot of love for Joe Biden. Always have, despite his faults. I'd probably prefer Biden if he supported public healthcare. I just can't understand why Americans can't get behind that.
Thank you! Politics is the art of the possible.
This is exactly how I’m feeling
[deleted]
[https://joebiden.com/take-action/](https://joebiden.com/take-action/)  It's a blast to text bank, and everyone is super supportive in the slack channels.
Having textbanked for Pete in the past, yes, I can't say enough good things about it. It's way easier than you'd guess and it's super fun.
I was a supporter of Yang previously, and my interactions of the hardcore bernie bros have been when they have raided our reddit server and spread lies about him saying stuff like he is a libertarian trojan horse and wants to take welfare from the poor  That is hopefully a small group, the majority are probs fine people
I followed Pete before he dropped, we got brigaded all the time with rat memes, and constant smear about anything really.
Thanks for stopping by and welcome! I was Team Pete until two days ago, but I'm happy to support Biden because of the overall positivity and unity focused message of his campaign. But if Bernie does get the nomination I'll be working to help him win.
Let’s just say I’m afraid to voice my disapproval of Bernie because his supporters are just so bratty and vicious. I feel that they’re making the same mistakes of 2016, assuming that every democrat swings left and left flabbergasted if Bernie loses. They’re alienating a lot of moderate democrats who are usually older and more likely to vote than the younger crowd.
It’s not that Americans can’t get behind it. It’s about being realistic about it. Such as putting someone in office that can actually work with congress and get the job done. Bernie isn’t that guy. You have to take baby steps, you can’t just throw everything together at once cause it won’t succeed that way.
Notice that OP clarified "the toxic Bernie supporters" need to stop.   You've then taken that and inflated it to all Bernie supporters.   OP was a Bernie supporter and an active participant in S4P.  Neither they,  nor I are poisonous and I'd really like for the rhetoric to stop.   We aren't all CTH, so stop giving those assholes a voice.
yes, that was disgusting.
Huh, that's a shame. We can't be to vicious with each other if we want to be united in the general election.
Psy-ops from Russia. They want us against eachother. Whoever wins, we rally behind. Period.
I do understand that Congress would not be particularly on-board with public healthcare, and that it's not as easy as electing a candidate in favour of it.   However, what I find shocking is that the American public is apprehensive of having a public healthcare system, or even something like Obamacare.

You're right, and the way you're approaching it here is civil and polite! I was a huge Bernie supporter myself way back in 2016 and it was hard to see anything toxic from the inside. The majority of Bernie supporters are good people and everyone needs to vote in solidarity come November. Wish you all the best.

Most Americans now support Obamacare and even a public healthcare option. But many, like myself, aren't 100% ready to trust the government enough to have it take control of all health care and not have something go wrong, especially early on. So I think expanding Obamacare to a public option is a reasonable path forward.
I think it is a mix of fearing the government controlling things, to how obama care was implemented. Public healthcare takes time to be cheaper and better, and for many their jobs got rid of their healthcare so they could switch to obamacare only for it to be worse and more expensive
One thing I hear stated often is that private health insurance is still allowed in Canada, but Bernie plans to eliminate all private health insurance here and make it illegal.   How much (if any) is private healthcare in Canada and do you think people would mind if it was made illegal? (Sincere question).

I learned about the 'other' Sanders subreddits from engaging civilly in other campaign subs.  I never saw any of it in s4p because I thought it was the only place.   There's a reason they are split out into a quarantined sub, and it's because they're toxic and their rhetoric doesn't fly in S4P.  Unfortunately there's nothing stopping them from going on other subs and acting like tools.
This was such a wholesome thread, with a Bernie supporter coming in peace, switching his support to Biden, and calling out the toxic supporters behavior, and then you come in and be a douche. Nice job
Fair enough.
It's not a two-tier system, but there are private health care clinics that offer services not covered under the Canada Health Act. Healthcare falls within provincial jurisdiction, and therefore it's up to the provincial governments to ensure that these private clinics are not breaking the CHA. The problem is that many clinics do, and some provinces let them push the boundaries. The federal government can then put pressure on the provinces in several ways, namely by fining them or, ultimately, threatening to cut transfer payments.   It's a niche topic in political discourse, and not many people talk about it.
I understand what you're saying, but there are people still today calling Pete a rat in r/politics and S4P. It's not something that is isolated to CTH. I'm not saying you're a part of it, but this isnt some niche thing and I spend a lot of time on reddit
And this is why we shouldn't unilaterally judge any one candidate based on anecdotal experiences.   Joe isn't the apocalyptic vote that everyone makes him out to be.  And some guy on the internet personally attacking my character isn't going to make me a Bernie or buster... even though it *can* have that effect for some.   I like Bernie as my #1, y'all like Joe as yours.   That's absolutely fine.   Both candidates need all of our supporters to win the national election.   Let's do this thing together,  no matter who crosses the finish line for the primaries.
If I see it,  I report it or I call it out.  I don't see it upvoted in S4P, but yeah it is in r/politics
You're doing what you can I sincerely appreciate that. Hope you have a good day.
You too, thanks so much for the civility <3

Wouldve been nice if he did that before the NV caucus...
Comeback Kid rackin' up all the endorsements today, my lawd!
That's quite the haul, I thought Reid was going to endorse Bernie.
*Looks over to Obama* \*A-hem\*
cool but like 2 weeks late
Yeah, Good. OK
Harry Reid the racist old white dude?  The one who said that Obama won the election because he was “light-skinned” and didn’t speak in a “negro dialect”.  What a great endorsement!👍
I can't tell if this is sarcasm?
tbh I thought he was going to endorse Warren
No.  We need Obama to stay out.  Not because his endorsement wouldn’t help Joe, because it would.   However, Obama is the one person in this entire party who can heal the wounds of whichever faction that ends up losing come convention time.  He’s the one man who can tell Sanders supporters that it won’t be the end of the world if Joe wins, and that we need their energy and desire for change if we want to beat Trump in November.  And if Sanders is the nominee, then he’ll be the one telling us that it’s ok and we need to suck it up and put Bernie in the White House.   Obama needs to be apolitical.  Because he’s the only one who can bring us back together when this is done.
No, [legendary NV Dem senator Harry Reid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reid).
No, it was based on an interview with Reid where he seemed really sympathetic to Bernie.  >Reid doesn’t count himself among the anti-Sanders camp, at least not in any official capacity. Asked whether he’d worry if Democrats went into the fall election with a socialist standard-bearer, he batted the question away. “If you look at national polls,” he says, “Sanders beats Trump in the general election.”  [Here's the interview.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-19/harry-reid-to-those-hoping-to-stop-bernie-sanders-speak-up)
Every Bernie supporter I know thinks Obama was too right-wing. He wouldn't convince them to back Joe in the general.
I’ve been going back and forth on that as well but think it would still be more helpful to get support now and avoid the possibility of contested conventions.    We’ll see what happens.
>He’s the one man who can tell Sanders supporters that it won’t be the end of the world if Joe wins, and that we need their energy and desire for change if we want to beat Trump in November.  And if Sanders is the nominee, then he’ll be the one telling us that it’s ok and we need to suck it up and put Bernie in the White House.  Hmmm, why do I feel like one of these camps will absolutely fall in line and vote blue no matter who, while the other will throw a fit and yell "RIGGED!!11!!!"?  Hint: It ain't Joe's camp
**Harry Reid**  Harry Mason Reid (; born December 2, 1939) is a retired American attorney and politician who served as a United States Senator from Nevada from 1987 to 2017.

The dream team of vice presidential candidates!
Oh, nice! This will be big in Virginia.
Tim Kaine is a class act.
💎🐊 COMEBACK KID 💎🐊
Wow amazing!
Biden will sweep Super Tuesday including Kaine’s Virginia. Only state Sanders will get is Vermont.
Biden2020
Kaine was a good choice for clinton, but I don't think I've ever seen a better running mate than Biden. He complemented Obama so well: he had decades of experience in the Federal government, he had chaired the Senate foreign relations comitte, he could connect with working class white voters in a way Obama couldn't, he had a more casual "everyman" persona compared to Obama's more stoic professorial demeanor... just a brilliant pick by Obama. That election had possibly the most significant VP picks on both tickets, because good LORD was Palin terrible, and undercut everything good about McCain. I knew a lot of democrats who genuinely worried Obama was too inexperienced to be President, and each of their VPs pretty much settled it for all of them. As Jack Cafferty said, "If John MCCain wins, this woman will be one 72 year old's heartbeat away from being President of the United States, and if that doesn't the hell out of you, it should."
Sanders will win California and Colorado without a doubt, unfortunately.
Really praying for the best but commiefornia
Completely agree! My hope is that Biden picks someone more like Obama if he wins the nomination so that people realize that the party is open to new blood in the future!
Hey, my niece lives there and she’s no commie
I hope he picks Obama
I know someone there who considers himself a Republican but can't stand Trump, so he's voting Biden in the primary.
Are you sure about that?
if that's a sneaky way of lining Pelosi up for the presidency i'm here for it
That would be the dream team!
Good man!
The Rob Reiner effect may help Biden in California. Rob Reiner is a widely respected film director who endorsed Biden a year ago and gets a LOT of screen time. Real Time with Bill Maher and all the news shows.
From what I understand VP Obama could be President again because the limits are technically on being *elected* President.
Do you think Arnold Schwarzenegger might give an endorsement?
Obama would never do it.  He’s a former constitutional law professor.  He’s not going to try to find the loophole in the Constitution that allows him to be POTUS again.  The whole point of the 22 Amendment is two limit the Presidency to two elected terms.  He got that.  He’s not going to try for a third.   Plus, he literally makes more money now giving a single speech than he made in a whole year of the Presidency.  He can retire and collect millions giving the same talking points to rich bankers who have nothing better to do with their money.  It’s a pretty swell gig.
He’s a Republican. He endorsed John Kasich in 2016
He's probably bored though.  I was thinking he might actually want to be VP, if his ego would let him.
>He’s a Republican.  Biden can win Republicans angle?
"You’re full of sh*t," Joe Biden tells a man who accused him of "actively trying to end our Second Amendment right."
hahahah go read the comments over at r/politics    they are so desperate it's grosssssss.    &#x200B;  but "AR-14"? lol that was a lil oopsie lol.
The people putting this out there and pretending like it's going to hurt him must know absolutely nothing about American politics.
Watch Trump and Bernie supporters try to make this the next “deplorable”
So... I am new to camp Biden, but I'm starting to get the "no malarkey" thing.
The guy was full of shit. This idea that Democrats are going to send a gestapo door to door to confiscate all guns is like something out of a CPAC fever dream. Good on Biden for making it very clear and very direct. “You’re full of shit” cuts through the noise a lot more effectively than a nuanced argument about what the founders actually meant.
As a gun owner, that exchange was solidly Biden winning even though it'll look like he loses.  He brought up machine guns and not being able to own one. Well, you can. You can own artillery if you like. Just file the appropriate paperwork, pay the fees, etc How do you think they do the big gun fun shoots? Those guys have permits; they are legally allowed to own those things.  See, the government rarely takes away shit. They just make it harder to get. More hoops. More paperwork. More fees. This whole NRA line about democrats being the end of guns in America is just utter crap.  Tbh, the NRA has done more harm to the American gun owner demographic in the last 20 years than helped. I loathe my local gun range, gun bros make women uncomfortable and they always have something to say about politics. I have been responding with "enjoying your membership fees paying off Russia??". Dude, I just want to shoot.  NRA has used some of the worst human garbage to promote gun rights and gun ownership but all they've done is make being someone like me very hard. I've gotta sit and listen to every liberal berate me about gun nuts and the NRA when I have never been a fucking member in my life nor have I voted for a republican in a federal election. Then I get to listen to fat guys pretending to be military talking about how chicks and lesbians are coming for their metaphorical cocks. FML.   We need a new permitting system.  We need training to be a part of that.  Everything else is negotiable.
That should be the theme of his campaign against Trump.
R/politics is claiming he told the guy he would slap him. Because a NBC article has that in quotations.  I listened the the video and I honestly don't seem him saying that at all.  Am I wrong here? Did anyone else hear that?
But he WAS full of shit.
He probably thought that because of Betos endorsement
Can we get people to go after Trump the way they’re going after Biden?
This will make people like him more. This is America. He’s surrounded by a group of tough men talking about guns and he stood his ground. Anyone thinking he lost his mind or edge needs to see this for the opposite reasons people think.
While I agree with Biden's sentiment I think I would have criticized Trump if he said 'you're full of shit' to someone he disagreed with (although I recognize the difference between an honest disagreement and someone misrepresenting your position entirely). A president, or in this case a presidential candidate, should be calm in the face of anger imo. This won't really hurt Biden though as it will be seen as a  'tell it like it is' moment in the primary. No one will remember it by the general.
Telling someone who's full of shit that their full of shit: good look.  Saying that you'll slap them: BAD FUCKING LOOK. C'mon, Joe. Keep that mouth of yours in check, man. You wouldn't see Obama pulling that.
As a Bernie supporter, I like this.  I think Biden appeals to the average person:  When someone gets is your face and falsely accuses you in order to embarrass you, the right thing to do is to call them out.  Biden did the right thing. Fuck that dude
The guy was full of shit, so count me in on this response.  I don’t agree with this kind of talk when it’s about actual policies. But when someone is peddling out false conspiracy theories.. then they deserve to be called out as such. This person clearly has no intent to engage respectfully with Joe.
Malarkey was detected and duly disposed of.
When we say no malarkey, we mean no malarkey.
...but how’s he going to be able to stand up to Trump in a debate? /s  I liked Joe Biden before, but I’m pumped right now for a Democratic President that isn’t afraid to call out conservative lies and fear mongering.  I seriously think this is going to boost his appeal to people who wants a strong leader who is honest and tells it like it is.
This was a bad moment for Biden imo ,you can still support someone but criticize them when needed
I mean, have you seen Bernie lecture at a crowd? Not sure why Bernie's base is so distraught over this.
As someone that is pro-gun. This is reassuring and it is definitely something I will be using to help sway my pro2a friends away from trump.
Just donated another $50, keep telling it like it is Joe.
Pete to Biden supporter here.  This is really off-putting to me. Every time someone asks Joe a tough question or challenges him on an issue, he attacks and insults them.
No malarkey
I love this! Love it.   Gotta beat back the lies and mistruths of this world.
That guy was full of shit.
The fact that guy couldn’t understand Joe’s point by asking him if he owned a machine gun was more cringeworthy than him saying AR-14 IMO. That is a great and simple argument and it went right over that guys head.
Joe going off
How people think this makes him look bad is hilarious. Especially with his crossover base of suburban women.
I was planning on voting Warren but am still torn between Biden and Sanders. I'm curious to know what solid Biden supporters think of Biden and his repeat bad interactions with voters. I agree the guy was full of shit but then he tells him to come out back and says he doesn't work for him. He also grabbed that guy by the collar and the whole IQ test/push up contest thing is just bizarre. What's his deal? What's your take on all this?
Anyone able to find the video saying he would ban guns or take them away? I did a YouTube search and only found videos of him saying he owned a shot gun and that he supports common sense gun laws. Actually one video from parent magazine he told the person to go buy a double barrel shotgun if she needed home protection.
Can someone explain to me how he can support the Second Amendment while also supporting confiscation without due process?  Or limiting firearm purchases to one per month?  Or mandate that firearm owners either forfeit their "assault weapons" or register them under the NFA?  Literally the entire purpose of the Second Amendment is to discourage a tyrannical government.  Doesn't giving the government a list of who owns what firearm completely invalidate that?
I dont get it, why is the guy full of shit? Biden did say that.
Joes the one that’s full of shit. An attack on the ar-15 is an attack on the second amendment.  He’s going to have Beto handle the gun control issue who has blatantly said they are going to go door to door and take your guns. How can you expect any firearm enthusiast to accept that? Anyways that’s my opinion.  Now all of the left leaning people of reddit can go ahead and tell me about how I don’t care about dead kids ...
Someone tell him about the Rules of the Road! 😳  But lol
Studies show there is a positive correlation between the amount of cursing a person does and honest they are.
My favorite thing about Biden is how he’s the exact opposite of Trump. Doesn’t result to petty insults, or physical threats like Trump did at his rallies. He doesn’t incite violence and instead hears out the people that are upset or disagreeing with him. That’s the sign of a true leader and perfectly contrasts what Trump represents. Oh wait sorry I just described Bernie. Clearly Biden resorts to the same, childish, petty temper tantrums that Trump does. Go off tho
He cant answer a difficult question without personally attacking ppl. What was with the finger jabbing? If hes the nominee catch me not voting
[removed]
He shushed his female aide and then threatened the guy with violence.   That’s how you react to a little questioning?  Trump is going to destroy him come November.  Edit: downvotes yet no explanation or defense. This should turn out well in November for sure.
Biden bros be like he’s a very stable genius 🤣
I had to unsubscribe a few days ago. Also unsubscribed from TYT on YouTube.
Yeah I cringed a little bit at "AR-14," that one is going to come back to bite him.  The guy was full of shit, though.
George W. Bush was elected President, twice. He couldn't say nuclear, find Brazil on a map and he started two ground wars in the Middle East. He made a mistake, I think this will help him. People are sick of Trump and they want a fighter.
I'm a bit dyslexic with numbers, so his "AR-14" mix-up is like me every day. 😆
Mostly people are upset about the threats of violence and saying he wouldnt work for the american people i think
Plus, as it was noted by a few tv analysts, he was in an auto plant not at a church picnic. Colorful language is common in an auto plant and I believe Joe recognized that.
They've been using these shitty tactics all damn year. Someone jumps up at Joe and the Joe beats them back and they spam the whole of online media about how Joe's the ultimate evil.  I'm not sure why they think any of that hurts him. I like him standing up to bullies and idiots. It's helping him.  It's just been one failed strategy, over and over and over. Whoever is thinking this crap up doesn't know what the hell their doing.  Then they get all excited about the first debate and then the 2nd and then the 3rd... it keeps on like that, till today. All the while they're continually hoping that Joe makes that 1 mistake they can use to win...  It's sad shit.
Joe just showed that Democrats are tough, resilient Americans.  Just because you are a public servant doesn't mean you have to put up with pure bullshit from anybody.
George W. Bush was elected President, twice. He couldn't say nuclear, find Brazil on a map and he started two ground wars in the Middle East.
I disagree.
Auto workers are delicate flowers that positively faint in the presence of such crass language!  Anyone who thinks that this seriously will hurt him, has never worked with their hands in their life.
Go to the Bernie subs they're already at it.
If this incident, isn't as bad or worse than those previous incidents, please explain why.    Don't think about in terms of who was right and wrong. You won't get any real argument from me. Despite my differences with many Democrats on the gun issue I WILL vote for Joe if he wins the nomination. But, please think about this from a messaging perspective.  It has a quotable sound bite, condecension and it was even directed at a real person, a factory worker no less. We need to win that demographic group. Look for this worker to be trotted out to general election debates if we have them. Worst of all,  niether Hillary nor Romney ever threatened to FIGHT A VOTER. This isn't just another "basket of deplorables" it's like "basket of deplorables" had a baby with Joe the plumber. At least it seems that way to me.
[removed]
People believed HRC had kids in the basement of a pizza shop.  There are some really dumb voters out there.
>This idea that Democrats are going to send a gestapo door to door to confiscate all guns is like something out of a CPAC fever dream  What did Beto (Biden's new point man on gun policy) mean when he said "hell yes" he's coming to take my guns? I assumed that's how his proposed confiscation would work
[removed]
He'd be more full of shit if Joe hadn't announced that Beto was going to be in charge of gun control. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/09/12/politics/beto-orourke-hell-yes-take-ar-15-ak-47/index.html  That isn't confiscation of ALL guns, but can you see how people who care about this issue might not see much of a difference between the government coming for some rather than all of their guns? If Joe wanted to frighten and agitate these people, that Beto announcement was the thing to do. Also, yelling at them and threatening to slap them won't convince them or calm them down. They are angry people with guns. Do the math.
 Biden threatened to take the guy outside and slap him after sticking his finger in the dudes face and being told to stop. Joe has lost his cool.
He said, "I'm going to take your AR-14s"  What part of that doesn't require confiscation?
I completely agree. I'm sick of the 2nd amendment purity test (really all of the purity tests) that one must take to be part of a group in this country.
We need a different word to be able to run it on broadcast TV. I nominate feces.
I heard it clearly.
and legend has it that he still is full of shit
Uncle Joe has to tell it as it is every once in a while
I'm torn by this. On the one hand you are right - decorum and rising above and respect of the office etc etc...    but on the other hand, he's talking to them in a familiar manner. and i dont mean that in any particular pejorative way.    I do the same thing in my job, tbh. when im speaking to the CEO I am very formal but when im talking to my team/subordinates I am WAYYY more casual (which is more me anyway).    so... yea i think you are right, but i am torn still
At what point was he not being respectful? The man didn't raise his voice and clearly explained his question and concerns. So what if what he had previously seen had been incorrect? It's the candidates job to clarify points and answer questions, instead Joe rudely responded "You're full of shit" and then gets aggressive when the guy asks not to have a finger pointed in his face.  If you make a mistake at work do you think its appropriate for your boss to swear at you and call you full of shit?
Show me the clip where Bernie threatens to slap someone in the face for disagreeing with him. I’m waiting. Have a feeling it will be a while tho
I mean he hasnt threatened to beat someone up though....Joe literally pulled a “meet me outside”.
When Trump behaves this way to his opposers at his rallies why didn’t you donate $50 to him? He was being just as childish and petty, what’s the difference?
Yeah, I'm still behind Joe. But I don't think this was a good moment.
lol you cant reason with these people. He made the right move.
Yeah, you can tell he's about to say something that sets him back when he goes "wait, wait, wait! before he starts.   Why can't he just ignore it?
I hope he wins but to be real It was not a good look for him
Calling a prospective voter "full of shit" and then threatening him to "take it outside" whilst raising his voice and aggressively pointing at him....yeah a great stable leader we can all look up to.
Hilarious?   Forget the issues that were at hand. Please explain to me how ANY member of office , especially the president has the right to put a hand in a voters face, tell him he’s full of shit, And then proceed to threaten said voter with violence.   Am I delusional? Seriously, how in the world can you rationalize that?
Honestly I just feel like he’s calling it like he sees it. After the way a majority of our country is so freakin idiotic with the whole trump debacle, i feel like this man has no patients for idiots lol. Heck, I even felt that way listening to the workers phrase the question. I’m so done with idiots at this point that I completely empathize with the almost anger I felt when he started speaking. It’s these idiots that blindly vote that allow us to wind up with someone like trump, whose so idiotic he’s legitimately dangerous. I haven’t seen the other stuff your talking about and if it’s true, that’s probably not a good look for Biden, but I feel like at this point it’s better to have someone who’s pretty blunt and doesn’t put up with bullshit, maybe to the point of being pretty callous, if it means just getting our country back on track and undoing the damage a shit ton of idiots enabled in this presidency. Just my thoughts. What do you think?  Edit: i just realized how much I said idiot here whoops. And I’m not even a solid Biden supporter I liked warren. But just watching the criticism of this stuff unfold is so angering when trump fucking joked about assaulting women (I’m an 18yr old girl) and got elected when I was freakin 15. WTF!!!  I’m so tired of hearing about dumb shit like this when NONE of it compares to the shit trump has pulled!!!!   sorry for the rant lol just had to get that off my chest. I don’t think the other stuff Biden did is right but I respect him for calling it like it is and cutting through all the political answer bullshitz
It’s entertaining
Listen to your gut. Look at Warren’s policies and look at Bernie’s. Look at Biden’s interactions with voters and look at Trump’s interactions with opposers at his rallies. Do the right thing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq4vPgyRQY8
There has been maybe two Supreme Court cases regarding 2A and the there is fairly limited restrictions on what the government can do with firearms. The “keep and bear” clause doesn’t prohibit limiting firearm purchases, nor does it limit what weapons the government can prohibit.   The government can’t deprive of anyone of property without due process so I don’t think confiscation would be allowed. I’m not sure what you mean specifically regarding confiscation without due process, so I’d be interested in hearing more of what you’re discussing there.
Seeing you guys defend this guy’s behavior is literally identical to how Trumper’s defend his antics. The hypocrisy would be quite hilarious if it wasn’t so painfully sad.
When you cherrypick the facts, maybe. It also describes Biden though. For example, last night there were protestors at his rally in Detroit. One of them threw an iPad which hit a senior Biden aide and knocked her down. And still, Biden was yelling "let them stay" for like 2 mins, wanting to hear what they had to say.
Im tired of it all too but let's get Trump out and then we can have the privilege again of being picky about the little things
Bah, I recently had discussion about AR-15 but for some reason, I was constantly saying AR-16, until I was corrected.  I know there is only AR-15, but at the time it completely slipped my mind.
The ~5% of America that gives enough of a shit that Biden got the number wrong are all gun nuts who were voting GOP anyways. No one else cares.
What's AR14? I googled it and it's a rifle. Was he supposed to say AR15?
He corrects it later in the conversation. It’s a non story.
If that of all gaffes come back to bite him I’m ending it all. Like that’s suuuuuuch an easy slip up
If your defense of your preferred candidate is:  "but Bush was dumber," maybe you should pick a different person to support. Also, when people say that they want a 'fighter' I think they mean someone who will work hard to deliver on their policy objectives, not somebody who LITERALLY THREATENS TO FIGHT THE VOTERS.
Can Trumo find Africa on a map?
people are sick of trump and therefore want a president who resorts to violent threats and petty insults like trump
what now?
The language isn't the issue, the policy is
...you literally just used the same excuse trump supporters used for his behavior...dude
Pointing out Joe spent decades lying about his involvement in desegregation isn't 'shitty tactics'. Surely its okay to be pissed off and question this?
They only care because they're latching on to anything they can to throw at Joe. Bernie has always been the 'angry, disgruntled' candidate. That's his baseline. He wags his finger at people (e.g. woman of color conference last year), and kinda yells at people when he gets booed (e.g. SC debate). Not to forget him yelling broad insinuations of corruption at other candidates either.
You're full of shit.
[Effort Post] The Comprehensive Case for Joe Biden
This should be pinned cause there are sooo many people coming here asking about why Joe Biden
Thanks for reposting this. This is one of the things that actually got me to soften up to consider voting for Biden, for what it's worth.
Thank you for taking the time to write this.  This is incredible!

Wow my heart swells reading this. Thank you.
GREAT READ...
Biden has what it takes to flip the swing states blue that are needed to defeat Trump!
An addendum should be added to address the Ukraine controversy Trump has manufactured, since that'll be Trump's biggest attack against him should Biden win the nomination.
It's even better the 4th time I've read it!
Wow, so many TILs from this post; many thank yous OP!  Imagine comparing Biden's record to Sanders' record. Biden has tried to grow and adapt to the times, whereas Sanders remain stuck in the past.
Thank you!
As a Bernie voter who is considering not voting in November if Biden is the nominee I appreciate this.   I think it really washes over his weaknesses. The bankruptcy bill is a huge red flag. I work with consumer protection agencies and actually it's really hurting middle class families. It's not good at all. There is nothing good about that bill. I say that not as a partisan (I usually am) i say that from my work experience which is nonpartisan.   I will sit down and examine Biden a second time. I have not decided what I will do but for moderates, i will say this. If Biden wants to beat trump in 2020 (I think I want him to but am unsure if I'll vote for him, bc I think hes still going to maintain that bloated military budget that results in children around the world dying and may cut deals to cut entitlements which would horrify me and which I would feel responsible for bc I voted for him) he needs to do 3 things:  1. Run as Obama's vp, and not as the senator from Delaware.   His record as a senator is questionable. People change and certainly Biden can too. But nevertheless his record before his time as vp is ugly. It's the typical neoliberal record, which many voters do not like (not saying they like bernies record any more than joes) but when I think of joe the vp I remember him more fondly.   2. Run on changing foreign policy. That's something he can really do even without Congress and it's a strong message. On this I think he would be fine, and I think he wouldnt institute another Iraq war. Again, I think it's possible hes changed.   3. He must stop attacking young people and progressives. It makes him look really bad, just like I'm sick of Bernie attacking other dems. If he wants to win he needs us , and even if hes only going to pay lip service to us and be bad towards progressives policy wise, if he wants to WIN he needs to suppress that urge.   As I said, I'm going to sit down and write out a long paper on Biden and at the end make my decision.   But in all seriousness I want to beat trump, and if Biden wants to win gettable progressives (some will never vote for a moderate but I'm open to the idea bc I have before and am getting sick of it) like me he needs to think about how hes going to unite the country against trump.   His message will win the dems, but it's like hes forgotten theres a non democratic general election coming up and bc of voter suppression and other issues he will need all hands on deck, and like Bernie hes not good at it. Hes good at uniting the base of the party (registered dems, African American women) but he really doesnt like when people debate him on his record and its offputting.   I say all this as kindly as I can, as someone who is concerned bc I've always voted dem and for the first time might not, and If someone like me is thinking that, despite being loyal in the past, then that's not a good sign.   I'd also add I think Bernie needs to appeal to a larger audience too, but I dont think hes going to win, so that just leaves Biden.   Downvote away if you must, but please dont ignore what I'm saying or that actually, this is a pretty fair and balanced assessment on the whole.

The main thing I disagree completely with him on is marijuana legalization. His views are stuck in 1990.  Edit: just downvotes, no attempt to explain how Biden might change his views, or why I should still support him.   I voted for Bernie in the primary, I’ll support any Dem over what we have now, but if it has to be Biden, at least give me a good reason to be proud of him.
Biden SEEMS like a nice guy, little goofy.   But that doesn't make him a good candidate, at least to me as a sanders supporter. Does he truly want to help us? My generation, millennials?   So far he hasn't, I REALLY want to give him a chance. But trust me when I tell you, he has pissed me off bad the last few years. We need someone who cares about modern issues. Not another boomer candidate ( no offense to older redditors)   We just need help, guidance. If Bernie fails, I hope that Biden can step in and provide that hole. That void, we are the economic future we matter. I hope you guys and HIM understands that.  My two cents.

I think this race is really focused on two issues and that's progressive reformation and getting a celebrity playboy out of office. I understand the sentiment of not wanting to vote for a candidate you don't believe in, but if biden is the nominee then the latter issue is still relevant.   You could help get a person who rallies right wing extremists out of office.  Just my two cents. It's also hard to get other democratic voters over to bernie when they see bernie supporters not falling behind the "vote blue no matter who". It may seem immature at face value, but I think that by not voting you are saying that Biden and Trump are equally as bad which I, and many others, believe to be objectively false.  Bernie is my first pick as well, but we shouldn't forget that Trump is the Big Bad Evil Guy in this election.  We definitely need a ranked voting system though.

The original post is the case for Joe Biden so start there if you want an explanation why you should be proud.  Also he does support decriminalization of Marijuana so I don’t see why you COMPLETELY disagree with him.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2020/03/06/joe-biden-is-frustrated-people-think-he-still-believes-marijuana-is-a-gateway-drug/amp/
Okay if that’s what you think boomer
MALARKEY ALERT - YOU JUST POSTED MALARKEY.   Please remove all items from your pockets like keys, phone, wallet, but most importantly, REMOVE YOUR MALARKEY.
Neither has Bernie, Mr. new account with low Karma. Please go elsewhere and troll.  That is, if you aren't even a Russian/Trump bot or troll.
I just hope he sticks to that if elected. I’m tired of risking arrest when buying and using it, when I could go buy a lethal amount of alcohol no problem.
I wasn't aware of that so thank you for that nugget of knowledge.  Completely off topic but that google amp link you shared is bad. It's a bit above my head but I've seen many people spreading information about it. It seems to impact the internet drastically so I feel the need to do what I can and share my own link that I would like you to look over.  https://medium.com/@danbuben/why-amp-is-bad-for-your-site-and-for-the-web-e4d060a4ff31  Again, I'm really unlearned in this stuff I just know it's important that as many people as possible should know this. Kind of like climate change. I'm unlearned in the full effects of continued fossil fuel use, but I am aware that it is important everyone knows about it being bad.
Great. Glad you support genocide profiteering. I'm not a boomer btw.
The entire point of NATO bombing was to stop genocide.   And the bombing lasted less than 3 months- not a very good job at profiteering.
