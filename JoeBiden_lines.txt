the vast majority see critical solely hitting policy segment base super toxic others online dont think ive seen directly personal attacks al 
i'm sent mods week ago in joining sub healthy conversation mostly wonderful way can't help notice constant trend low effort posts always end effectively why bernie supporters terrible people know going sound disingenuous hear what actually aim answer hope get opposing candidate's subreddit the recent one comes seven day old account discussed politics like many companion threads shot attacking sanders understand experiences authentic disallowing stop cth kids dicks subs rhetoric all suck continues frequency today biden wins nomination worried effects generalizations may national election look pete came citing broad attacks want happen general would best ahead early please give thought whether trump another years for transparency also really it's exciting much momentum rough feeling longer clear path we fight hands future believe one healthcare human right pursuing higher education something government actively encourages instead allowing capitalism sandbagging every generation gate listen science take real steps towards keeping world generations as deeply tolerate candidates insults somehow think make country dnc better it encourage rely divisive trumpisms rally us candidate hanging fruit ultimately nothing spoil last there's wave tweets describing anecdotal worst camp yes coming troll accounts enough ones this behavior true camps yuge online presence comparably need collaboration ensure focus discuss policies personal made condemns types show embrace report trolls see check age history unusually dialog super nice coordinate regarding banned well small good faith gesture could go long thing sure are lose voters type fuels they'll add echo chambers unity win primary mitigate poisoning thank reading 
focus positive rules road action 
vicious cycle saw play warren sub sanders trolls come constantly the sub's regular users get angry start directing bernie ramped negative posts attract supporters and definitely hope go path 
totally agree it's easy criticize mock politicians supporters disagree better us present think positive way forward 
think approach nuance we criticize sanders policies stomping new low like anti semitic absolute 
people allowed make negative posts bernie there nothing wrong criticizing another candidate policies he deal attacks jewish definitely immune criticism it's perfectly valid criticize there's lot negative biden supporters can't afraid conflict let get walked 
i'm sanders supporter considering biden lately would fine either one lately sub slamming the campaign showing desperation remember seeing anything joe's statement 
they running both said lot nice things also critical 
do think joe biden never criticized opponent's campaign this elections work 
the go low vote joe tweet gold though 
political twitter terrible it i'm afraid getting continually worse 
this joke right but yes bernie jewish actually lost lot family holocaust he also independent politically speaking 
easy first one joe gets socialized medical care via government official he's currently private citizen running office officials you clearly clue healthcare system works elected people work employer health insurance plans like everyone else employed country 
this putin republicans want democrat's split attack seriously unite party trump jms that's good attitude think follow let's assume biden genuinely dislikes racism anti semitism leave 
technically everything written publicity stunt 
all us far common differences culture heritage etc celebrated vilified inclusion one things really drew pete loving fact joe's campaign also drawing people instead attacking 
sounds like describing bernie sadly even win nomination 
yeah definitely something lines nutty maga crowd anything would see true blue democrat not major problems certain parts party certainly typically going people unfurling nazi flags vote 
like believe rotr coined another sub meant anti sanders posts removed unfortunately absorbed supporters begun notice see end 
things calmed lot last days sub yep reality sure always positive luckily us supporting joe thankful onwards upwards 
yep think need let toxicity base go repeat policy fine 
this amazing post completely agree let focus spreading awareness joe policy plans convince people vote blue we need unite within party ever

sanders supporter well politics in man race going negative way gain ground think least positive encouraging sign seems happening lately testament bernie mostly character go 
true would've cool bernie least retweeted from campaign standpoint guess necessarily logical boost opponent when characterized negativity surrounding online presence though maybe good idea 
it would nice sanders actually good things talk 
you're right joe biden criticizes donald trump time 
no describing joe bernie said win nomination unfortunately takes beat trump trump's base loyal hard working 
lot warren klobacher supporters attacked harassed online long time we course candidate drip it's emotional sound showed adjust things felt sane way iowa they good decent people need cooling period naturally passionate got then dropped calling rat snake everything come around try pay nice came mostly angry disjointed fresh seeing theocracy the accounts we're ridiculing pete et al feigning civility just give know go back kind selves many conversions policy electability it occasionally hated never personal there always line but tolerate much trust new subscribers 
it's tough when log reddit see bunch false misleading malicious things pushed front page propagandists we going ugliness self police hard but least negativity less focused character attacks reactionary 
it's really true this last week crazy great know hands lol 
really like bernie sanders quote 
that sanders found joe capable letting billionaires fund campaign 
he's never wrong years right 
what source quote curious want stockpile gentle retorts sanders crowd 
love kind retorts sure bernie people us well the reality biden deeply good men fighting improve country citizens entire lives we forget 
some top people campaign also glowing things say biden dared run sanders david sirota said chosen vice president showed progressive wing democratic party corporate 
joe put ad like sanders obama's kind words bernie years ago 
look agree joe bernie warren harris et al like side equally irritated started running ad praise obama it good rowing general direction praising one person mean think best president biden nice things say https www washingtonpost com news powerpost wp daily joe biden bernie sanders remains wildcard lying hypocrite today says make better 
can bloomberg make ad hey mikey 
pretty sure bernie said similar things he clear disagrees biden policy 
nice see biden post first time ever among sanders spam 
interesting i'm hearing much kinds quotes bernie's people ironic 
and years went consequences age grandparents he's still sharp trump though that's good 
biden use ad since bernie deserves taking obama words outta context 
can start politics thread what bernie really thinks joe biden link video 
man hate how direct sanders focus trump 
such nice guy bernie also devoted entire life working class people prefer 
bernie used good man someone needs 
curious biden kind words bernie 
let try avoid nuance do support gay marriage biden no barack obama redefining civil side constitutes we that basically decision left faiths people practice determination call 
interview biden said running https www youtube com watch time continue yiupm aw 
sounds like sanders fellow pretty decent reasonable guy 
sanders always friendly joe they've worked together long time simply decent dude see sledging bernie either 
so seem really like sanders out curiosity win nomination would vote actual election 
all political campaigns bloodsport especially primaries you multiple people running exact position probably agree guy policies however want elected make platform seem radically different find random quote years ago twist saying hates black sure know mother children good measure 
very well put regardless wins nomination need galvanize base trump personally would prefer sanders obviously biden heart right place 
and they've plenty time together senators i'd shocked shred camaraderie even five years past quote 
yeah there's clips biden obama praising sanders well virtues 
bernie still says biden good guy interviews today he disagree policies common trump want win damn joe gets nomination better lose like hillary horrible debate stage make look young man running around 
hell yes more must we stand together democratic party bernie joe amazing values similar ideas vary record past experience plans implementing policies well progressives as progressive refuse term stolen exclusively bernie's supporters stripped away people like barack obama bill clinton biden done much progressive things united not smear trump using talking points hillary so please do candidate matter do give enemy advantage that said candidates comes heavily disappointed certain fraction i'm gonna refer bros whatever certain toxic disrespectful sink level and already unable answer question will support loses nomination unthinkable you dont love degrees agenda common ideology bloomberg yes even would better bush could reelected least defending nazis confederates to nominee whoever against trump unbelievable 
exactly anti sanders attack biden bandwagoning supporters bernie 
errrr he's pretty much explicitly said biden serving corporate interests billionaires point 
unfortunately sanders let whole rich people look devil hard stop get control can't reign part base going wild one really 
except thing implies pocket billionaires corrupt 
doesn't say biden's old policies gut middle class though 
that fine hope support dem candidate matter come november we beat trump 
and much progress bernie actually made working class people 
stop brigading bernie guy make us look like jackasses 
it turn democrats voting primaries jesus 
what bernie sanders said gay marriage thing https time com bernie sanders 
what said past seem matter it administration even became legal joe sure supports he record vice presidency back people's views evolve sorry 
what mean civil side whats 
literally one cares vote we good without go away 
just fyi pm asshole sent yeah go back chapo mr too pure to be smart trump pence obama biden get fuck outa bullshit you right go came chapos dreams socialist utopia flourished australia ps said comparable yes compare know got hateful assertion banned much free speech hahaha enjoy getting ass fucked elected officials next years tho 
sure come conclusion like sanders bernie voted third party rather hillary deeply regretted since four years later find thinking little pragmatically less enchanted broad sweeping policies promises furthermore take concern way campaign running as former pete supporter saw lot mud thrown wholesome pragmatic progressive candidate supporters really inconsequential shit if nominee would vote heartbeat though think actively 
would vote sanders general i'm adult my biggest issue bernie attacks democrats like biden pete he attack policy base character implying corrupt bought billionaires corporations this sort rhetoric true also extremely damaging people actually believe turns voting election makes trump's victory likely 
if biden wins bernie supporters need get behind vice versa feel lot like falling trap hillary vote voted trump send anti establishment message they cant time 
sanders already stepping attacks he bringing things joe said make seem like one step away overturning gains civil rights movement the foot soldiers take queues campaign staff it bernie bros acting completely independently 
well yeah that's disagreement policy 
there definitely extremist non extreme solid bernie supporter want scream russian bots know people sucks 
that main goal it bad unlikely bernie win really support values beliefs but come election time independent voters moderates willing vote radical 
there least two post offices new names say ton 
he actual political discussion troll 
came conclusion comment obviously must misinterpreted also seen problems pete race that important original question curious obviously would like pragmatic possible whatever gets trump office want much change but risk losing election so know point man 
that seems like pretty good argument bernie electable 
unfortunately reality today politics if smear attack opponents chance winning 
not really it's accusation bad intent fundamental political corruption mean literally says biden serving behest billionaires that's policy 
dislike bernie think he's decent person but numerous surrogates launch extremely dirty attacks biden even apologized teachout i've critical busing issue though understand time polling support among black voters delaware barely broke sometimes negative polls family members say mixed feelings ones would theoretically children benefit tldr it's complicated wrong seen white call segregationist like george wallace based scoff voting hell nah close level mean look bill de blaiso hear said frankly biden's could fire back example video blaming obama mississippians democrats insanely tone deaf saying guns different chicago vermont yikes so get upset mild retort supporters may use response people screaming corrupt

you always vote ballot progressives 
on contrary he generates dynamic answers instead shoehorning questions fit year old pitch combine stutter yes get someone sounds like human 
oh know maybe they'll realize sandman evolved positions time 
he endorse gay marriage openly 
the point people change evolve issues just electorate whole we celebrate growth demonize https www nytimes com us politics gay rights ally bernie sanders wasnt always vanguard html huffpost entry marriage fcc de bf nbcnews election evolved sex 
yep federally recognized marriage sure must basic human right huh and besides think gets office he'll start legislating 
yeah read go away part 
see backlash pete lack support minorities classify problem race he still young man working hard solve problems control everything city happens despite shortcomings mayor really sold held town hall officer involved shooting listened people try deflect defend acknowledged partially blame apologetic genuine personally think biden likely accomplish change coalition supporters behind meaningful accomplished holding house trying flip senate bernie wins polarizing general election imagine midterms would favorable democrats swing districts good luck decision making process 
no good warning bernie supporters abstain vote trump brainswashed trolls rhetoric trying say treated unfairly try divide us 
he's saying biden propped handful billionaires he's bought although extent think implying ultra wealthy desires anathema everyone poorer they looked field decide candidate would best serve interests chose 
got done watching bernies super tuesday follow video said something effect think biden decent guy look forward debating issues avoiding personal attacks focusing definitely summarized last sentence first word 
mean billionaires helping fund campaign serving extent 
well i'm upset saying difference policy your points biden's perspective segregation may valid much biden bernie's regards supporting interests billionaires 
as long works acknowledgment people consensus fine remember election trump 
well sanders problem isnt changing order appeal moderates change compromise positive negative 
that's true in letter local newspaper recently resurfaced chelsea summers new republic sanders wrote supported abolishing laws dealing abortion drugs sexual behavior adultery homosexuality etc part campaign vermont governor carried many positions day he one federal lawmakers vote defense marriage act ban sex marriages and told time's jay newton small march current stance marijuana legalization backs medical characterized war costly destructive mayor burlington signed gay pride day proclamation calling civil rights issue members house representatives politically tough decision prides points key progressive bona fide opposed don ask tell another president bill clinton era policy unions 
his campaign almost money despite it seem like anything typical donation caps 
that's different question i'm happy get either way policy critique 
lol replied wrong person sorry but real biden's camp notoriously broke he even campaign several st states zero literally air ads like day last minute super pac cash came well good say billionaires frankly joe network young voters bernie needs fundraisers and fond bloomberg although always give serious props gun control i'm desperate get trump if wants spend another billion bucks getting running non stop fl az etc spearheading voter registration welcome the rnc war chest can't bring knife fight understand refusing sometimes compromise 
but bernie came womb positions fully formed please look immigration gun control record tho

agree sentiment quite hollow becomes popular bernie longer political threat many subreddit could done better job fair costly long favored biden greatly dislike manipulativeness that's admittedly necessary part campaigning rubs wrong way plea relaxed behavior would emerge today particularly packaged giving trump voldemort treatment while think bad president possibly worst one ever whoever follows going entire country will see similar hypocritical calls patience sympathy inflamed emotions supporters post election following demonization surely months even literal demons demonized fall far short perhaps worse even bother hypocrisy like people avoid making mistake twice empathy openness others' perspective tactic partisanship needs avoided time partisans side terrible horrible good seem within one's 
vote biden general wins nomination think beat trump four years getting nothing done change sanders candidate offering vision actual wants maintain status quo noticed sucks ass crushes hopes average americans 
genuine input hear if think bernie voters going come biden sorely misunderstand vote first place they view things like this preferred flavour democrat rejecting ineffectual centrism always capitulates whims big capital expense people breaking us system dominated decades resulted two parties basically represent thing to real difference trump outcome style civil friendly face american hegemony nasty you understand supporters go simply i've following campaign closely eligible usa candidate either far largest bloc support anyone and result lose 
like include so wanting better country part try set believe strongly ideas candidate stands 
bernie's people passionate they intense they're also violent hateful like america these ones not welcomed 
that opinion trump like every president life basically except openly crass throwing vote away supporting someone align political beliefs you scare none sense if ever chance build independent party would time sanders easily get then parties forced genuine 
i'm democrat think guys convince still vote election like joe trump voting lesser two evils unless solid group people otherwise why worth because if that's good reason really president i'll house senate 
giving vote someone compromise ideas giving ability ignore have something run besides trump maybe guys win or get vp bernies unwavering people want blue independent progressive platform it simple like hope start really living reality 
it's painful bernie spoiled lifelong consistency brave standing what's right popular widespread especially political arena man fights future today we'll end voting biden somewhat bitterly to never like public office the progressive peeps forward ideas place need strong but going back decades advocating it makes incredibly sad i'm completely he gave hope anywhere its crushing try learn stole heart contrast hard trying offend tough depart inspires edit stemming election cycle really wondering third party could get ground days while moderate dems ones lot common also enough divergence know anymore 
belonging perhaps important rules road we belong movement matter originally supported feel best choice at end day left along never trump brothers sisters right pete likes call future former republicans must unite defeat 
joe is part rotr https twitter com boknowsnews status 
honestly they're even bit closeted trumpers irl vitriol wild yet meet sanders supporter kind public work place even pete stickers hat ironically enough ones know personally consider low information voters you try engage candidates policies might clear made attempt look sometimes seem running either or frequently say fan becomes intend voting primaries 
and ultimately going fight like fuck beat trump they need minute willing gear next 
this implies skewed cut distribution boo implication 
i'm sure feel extension supported war iraq

bernie gets heckle candidate strength basically get why etc claiming could things done the reality can't knows disingenuous borderline unethical continue claim free year university joe trying community college healthcare unfortunately work trump promising build wall make mexico pay it hurt party biden increase bust movement ultimately matter dem primary it's i've already seen massive amount thread others believe sanders campaign coordinating message whisper 
so many people dropped recently voters finding way team joe hope bernie time comes

ready and willing reporting duty sir delete screenshots i've saved worst things said past months forgiven lets go get don together 
or least acknowledge bad actors small vocal minority nowhere near majority bernie supporters the vast passionate goals us

that's like hear time put aside differences save america 
and need intelligence passion bernie supporters win next fight 
this lives i'll probably downvoted scared hi mods please bigger us hopefully y'all block ban aka help come around vote biden say my heart urging i'm sincerely worried biden's frailty nominee i'd feel guilty i've spent hours upon reviewing footage edited unedited alike debated supporters hoping defend they yet serious might give chance behavior increasingly close trump's came conclusion panic attacks lose the status quo kills nothing alienate bernie's tired dying struggling survive day suffered obama years change anything meaningful that's people bernie bust open hearts minds believing america protects seem like anyone point selfish trump morally can't man looks deteriorating front eyes find cruel he needs enjoy relax imagine much presidential office would want part breaking he's human deserves well long bet someone gonna sigh good luck voters still open discussion terrified please 
this great right lot us want vote president moment know sound ridiculous feel like dnc needs hear voice and heard supporting candidate wants please not put corner make stupid bernie supporters frustrated need convincing joe shell we someone real always fought rights would love examples convinced honestly feels republican disguised democrat 
think cause posts starting hostile people agree mexico abortion comment uncalled dude hope better 
think good chunk us point made friends yangganger day lol even og joe supporters he's kind superman jesus figure either but guy democratic base clearly turn dime rally around so i'm sad pete year excited fuck run trump town november honestly kicking incumbent infinite money zealot like support fucking feat feel something pumped lesgo 
former yanggang ngl joe top pick yang warren but hes nominee nothing portant beating trump 
expand aca know bernie people wants but expanding step direction advantage actually achievable and course stop putting kids cages get neo nazis white house 
the way see vote biden let rbg retire that's i'm passionate 
sad got downvoted since way biden gain support bernie supporters 
get i'm worried here's biden hillary main reason trump running namely uniquely unpopular polarizing candidate expanded base like he thinks keep party line win way but going fewer undecided voters time turnout good sign us one definitely enough people persuaded argument really stand four years you're already seeing like saw 
hope whoever chosen face trump 
it goes without saying want better country this post bernie supporters us 
disagree we forgive right thing friend cool 
lazy can't even type joebiden com look speech youtube want attention bye 
if think public option even remotely better shitshow vote biden 
biden likely repair institutional competence government us standing international allies important often neglected since campaigns focus promised legislation think unfortunate he proven policymaker attempt moderate politically pragmatic evidence backed reforms areas unless bad identifying worthwhile better grasp political expediency longtime expert want vote if he's describe others engage point view 
https joebiden com joes vision here's joe's positions if want quick example biden wants minimum wage america 
people said exact thing trump put literal rapist supreme court bench sit next years you want choose another rbg passes away 
so proud campaign embraced rotr 
bernie voter warren preferred person rotr cheers dems we party go good trouble civil rights the aca the moon shot also anyone time machine can al gore right 
if choose throw vote away independent candidate trump win nomination party member dare think complaining next four years 
what hoping trump would end republican party cause democratic grab lot conservative voters shift right new bernie name pending form left unfortunately republicans coalesced around spectacular fashion he something like approval rating among there also little sign knowledge base shrinking therefore simply room two wing parties if faction split sweep every single election that unfortunate reality current system point rose tinted image while certainly impressive public servant many flaws seems utterly incapable compromise honestly nearly disqualifying politician compromise essential part effective governance politics look quickly supporters attack biden stating try reach across aisle since dirty word want literally nothing accomplished four years sake ideological purity way highway approach fine actually care effecting policy improve lives americans necessity major comment getting long let know interested type concerns might help disillusion somehow tier candidate ever close can see idolizing unhealthy 
unfortunately third party never work complete overhaul election system first past post allow nature if switched parliamentary maybe room 
know sucks give hope ever finding another politician like much bernie it's kind breakup you think never find someone ex usually 
think see third party candidates cycle everyone knows important unite defeat trump also hope kindness joe supporters sub make little less bitter cast vote 
bernie spoiled lifelong consistency brave standing what's right popular widespread take heart reason things became cosmic accident it passionate supporters like making case believe in way biden different yes still race the today running platform make progressive president since fdr shaped immensely influence party 
progressive movement huge impact democrats win november any legislation passed require votes if republicans zero biden proposing public option free poor the strengthen year college student debt relief progressives increase emissions push move date stronger actually chance first time change country support medicare i'm extremely hopeful 
it tough someone whose around block many elections count number times voted for candidate stave disaster supreme court less one hand but thing whatever may think joe biden all us would benefit tremendous unity trump ousted everyone still supports loses legitimacy seriously sense concerned comes together kick whole business curb and then productive arguments progressive vs moderate wings party means splitting compromiser nature that's good he's building coalitions democratic goals bad thinks meet segregationists anti immigrant jingo ists halfway better pressure right stand plus damn satisfying ass 
biden voted iraq war abortion access gave eulogy storm thurmond funeral working desegregation sex marraige told insurance companies wall street business usual veto even passes tells voters dumb asses work gets physically aggressive that top head edit believe forgot barred witnesses testifying clarence thomas anita hill trial

same and sincere follow biden campaign really soothing he say thank endorsement move worked gubernatorial candidate state dropped happened folks repeatedly given credit thanks pete amy beto campaigns contributions super tuesday win this tells looking king all leader talented team he's willing happy surround good people happily shares stark contrast populist cult personality technique dominates trump administration let's 
always torn beto kamala though liked warren so dropped course went month later kind neutral observer apart strong dislikes think see amazing things she brilliant watch cross examine anyone thing beauty for eyes prize let's go joe 
and go post joebidan subreddit if going duplicitous seem like effective strategy also know someone sympathetic biden ultimately warren dropped really nefarious 
when look post history they've biden supporters whole time some us indecisive though 
warren also honestly skill set makes really good senator say running department senate needs super detail oriented people new ideas executive branch 
dunno she pretty awesome head sec 
but first days really important imagine rbg probably want retire basically immediately biden gets sworn hope democratic supermajorities boston change law require baker appoint democrat interim senator 
schumer retiring anytime soon he got job 
very true like bernie voting certain subreddits twitter apparently i'm die hard enough fans it's really odd lectured told people side makes think something fishy going seem encounter social media as far irl goes husband gets little heated talking politics remind chill he's never asshole starts things he's passionate voice loud also stop bringing sanders everyone hang like please double date night husband's debating capitalism vs socialism other entitled opinions beliefs vote whoever want people forget black white there's supporters nice i've trash talked buttigieg fan called names warren but great friends love liberal dearly went know that's okay happy see engaged critically thinking deserves and flip favorite student recently parents trump he reasoning whole heatedly disagree still managed raise bright talented funny compassionate kid with said sorry jerks it bums feel good lumped douchebags represent bernie's message taking care need anyway luck joe condolences hope heard last incredible intelligent working woman

joebiden responds bernie establishment claims got beat overwhelming support african american community you suburban women hardworking middle class folks 
yes love effectively showing bernie discrediting voters reducing establishment herd love this 
there really difference bernie yelling 'the establishment' trump 'deep state' point it's meaningless catch boogieman term anyone agree paranoid old men cult like followers 
wish would closed proceeding put aviators turn enjoy two scoop ice cream cone 
bernie gonna lose latino vote least florida praising castro 
meanwhile bernie going full fraud throwing hail mary ad blitz using barack obama sanders would consider corporate establishment candidate convince young black people likes even though video years ago 
bernie also got beat attack dog supporters spend much time denigrating candidates pretty destroy possibility pick drop let's see warren react candidate called snake

wish biden would endorse ubi vats ask yang vp that dream ticket annihilate trump bernie one move 
sanders bragged never working corporation how many americans worked one though he's criticizing probably majority families 
but happened th nd media collusion losers corralled st biden ones first choice took smears man stepped post due he news pundit if deny alll welcome back 
that's i've saying get go bernie trump different clothing imagine joe said half delusional paranoid sometimes outright mean things followers say the media would eat alive why given pass edit spelled wrong yikes 
it's exactly telling someone day bernie bros reddit trump fans two sides coin 
bernie yelling 'the establishment' dude gov forever complains establishment ok jpeg 
gotta love bernie running misleading ad obama praising rachel maddow asked establishment says biden lol 
the corporations billionaire class vote tuesday regular people clearly chose biden 
when hear folks attacking the establishment like problems guys congressional black caucus what beefs cra vra it's bit facetious shows meaningless label nothing othering contrarian posturing 
bernie fans anti trump also purity tests conspiracy theories intentional spreading false information dunning kruger syndrome cult like devotion gaslighting confirmation bias 
these monikers almost always backfire candidates trump supporters got ton mileage hillary's deplorables comment biden establishment 
bingo it's quintessential horseshoe theory 
so full disclosure sanders supporter see kind things said bernie around seeing huge number comparisons drawn supporters trump we need remain united democrats refrain driving wedge deeper 
don't forget manufacturing consent mainstreammediaconspiracy 
do actually know establishment sanders thinks killing campaign is joe part obama every billionaire nation regardless political interest party choosing vague group saying ones blame mess conspiracy theorist thinking 
think deep bernie knows done gotten desperate 
warren sanders tries play nice get endorsement https youtube com watch lqcqii cu 
and hard explain supporters binary either bernie uncompromising 
momentum shift really crazy saw many people predicting may drop super tuesday lol 
certain subreddits the establishment screwing bernie twice row 
mean biden ran president twice also lost he making exceptional run time 
the thing sanders supporters hate joe biden finding time vote bernie 
who would thought non voters vote 
the trick try avoid using primary opponents name possible limit republicans capitalizing sound bites what actually unusual biden dropping opponent attack but defensive bernie trashing everyone corrupt 
ain't yang guy ubi's always policy liked 
like yang really understand ubi result various companies charging since know much money people making talking things rent landlord asked sub back get clear satisfying response 
he sure get primary though 
i'm silicon valley way progressive liberal man big tech companies agree bernie's approach antagonizing corporations many move jobs operations offshore friendlier country think fine balance getting pay taxes also working continue keep btw obama good terms leaders 
bernie never support dems it collusion smears vast majority want sanders represent democratic party 
why bernie given pass the reason trump made teflon utter lack shame he ignores match world view 
idk would go quite call exact both certainly populist carry many problems feel bernie still wants good america trump way want 
bernie given pass kind trump passes 
we're going build big beautiful wall health care system mexico wall street pay 
agreed the worst thing bring populist say nothing wrong 
just wondering mean things bernie said 
ever even read biden's voting history literally voted overturn protection women's right abortion keep schoolbuses segregated i'm bernie bro statement backwards can't believe illiterate american populace we're doomed 
i've saying thing months let's see purity tests check conspiracy theories intentional spreading false information dunning kruger syndrome cult like devotion gaslighting confirmation bias did miss anything 
support white supremacy affordable healthcare very true 
dude's congress longer i've alive he's establishment yet apparently pete buttigieg insider 
bernie's worldview odd biden establishment obama pete buttigieg also makes internal sense whatsoever 
absolutely hilarious obama establishment yet obama's vice president ok bernie 
that's always snag bernie bros hit argument they talk billionaires corporate interests end day decided votes cast regular people biden winning primary looks pretty well track continue 
wish could find right great clip floating around back whoopi goldberg going hard defence biden 'establishment' accusation they're irrelevant uninspiring never help anyone 
not mention groups vote trump send message people dislike 
sanders deputy campaign chair cnn defending gaslighting obama ad getting argumentative demanding host deny obama's words this tactic kellyanne conway's playbook hear surrogates constantly insisting bernie support versions policies care fellow americans like trump sycophants think make america great to respective supporters person ability actually get anything implemented next years 
hope diligent policing tones sanders supporters example ones pushing lie joe biden dementia 
agree completely lot people try divide create impression huge biden sanders strong public option eventually become also free community college albeit years instead i've even heard boards someone suggesting aoc party nonsense we democrats though may agree everything defeat donald trump united 
agree completely biden supporter think lot people sick called basically republicans large share bernie supporters we see comparisons rhetoric used trump anti establishment system get us kind but is narrative pushing so really need dismiss shit work together whether candidate wins mine working towards big picture goals let shape kick ass 
it like guys got butts vote bernie primary 
whether choose stay home entirely my toddlers also throw tantrums get way often lose you different calling sanders supporters cultists productive but neither calling elizabeth warren snake accusing voting vaginas suggesting buttigieg somehow cheated iowa caucuses generalizing biden corporate establishment needs stop casting aspersions stones we already got one asshole national politics would rather divide us unite and core problem seems willing clyburn joe shill pursuit ideological purity 
stay home we bow terrorist look state sub its cult like 
if shoe fits lace shit wear handle legitimate criticism candidate cult 
if bernie supporters want called cultists need stop acting like they're cult swearing candidate one win supports ignoring fair criticism attacking ones make pretty much thing members defend gurus 
dude what said aipac platform bigotry extremely fucked flippant touch 
someone else mentioned trump's sander's campaigns underscored anger discontent they tout outsiders clean washington approach earnestly something new ted cruz thing republican party hates the reason ronald reagan's obama's legacies positively viewed respective parties always known people's persons whether agree policies obama reagan considered like able personable end day still work enemies get things done 
trump listened fox news regurgitated whatever said that is gop loved 
let's say landlord also getting ubi decides raise rent knows month you three choices roll get robbed pay move sue price fixing extorsion the idea landlords wont they continue business usual rates dependant competitive local market specific unit owned landlords guoge find tenantless money relocate fight fundamental principle called bottom capitalism its described yang's book length easy read recommend

it given moment interacting russian going wait primary begin engaging bernies supporters try encourage rejoin party 
always https giphy com gifs harry potter alan rickman riew ccwrvq 
bernies going drop debate hope today next tuesday strongly biden decides drag longer 
yes there already complaints biden people threads let obnoxious 
thanks fellow feeling janesmithagain this lot process 
bernie worst advocate ideas wish would seen it made primary cycle much healthier interesting 
the idea universal health care huge winner polled exceptionally well states decades even sanders started making headlines version even almost years ago shit hilary proposed bill would provide security card every citizen entitling medical treatment preventative services etc in end guess they compromise problem always friends right real need smart get closer vision this obamacare affordable care act final stripped basically miracle pass long game short one 
can link exit poll see yet 
if someone said would offer food all poll well offering free stuff zero ability deliver cheating 
in polls though one referring people similar opinions public option even more popular basically every democrat wants make healthcare thing they'd happy happier 
i'm us citizen just interested politics access news channels could please send link exist polls 
think american thinks health care system needs we completely disagree fix 
either candidate would improvement current administration support whoever nominee 
good enough you're staying civil lol 
same talk shit enough sanders spam go harass subs threads 
same end the vocal sanders base horrific say least may hate bernie agree policies attacks candidate supporters makes excuse dnc msnbc anything else imaginable bernie's lead surprised biden wins nomination lot simply vote spite desire congratulate edit made mistake looking twitter absurd they're saying can't beat trump instead voting going fine handing win they're blame electable even though ones it's deplorable 
you're winning whole corrupt dnc behind it's corruption illegitimacy exposed i'm sure 
joe first choice sure but feel really good almost every candidate many respect much speaking empathy different voices party used think joe's push unity talk anymore 
please welcome us bernie supporters my younger virulent cohorts need energy directed getting excited things radically improve lives it's easy right thing vote joe ones get jazzed show experience understand consequences inaction really looking forward seeing biden campaign works attract bernie's movement including platform 
just honest this stresses joe great debater although seemed matter much far 
hear i'm far progressive joe want form public option soon possible need country become carbon neuteral the hope give ensures least sense comfort much passing torch presidency wants put best advocates different parts government like beto guns liberal stance think biden daft complacency led trump likely spend four years pulling back together new generation 
trump literally waiting rbg die take away abortion rights it's evil non that's truth this november do not give selfishness vote like little cousin stuck cage border 
please hand trump keys second time prepared back sanders big lead 
alien voice come peace end alien vermont grew bernie whole life love pieces came reddit see biden supporters right easy someone say vote frustrated right just keep mind true sanders around voted hillary last time told think many fear repeating much except blue even first choice candidate 
not bad idea give people space think choices approach 
problem echo chamber mate russians need yell something every real bernie bro repeating acting true going hard break engaging loses nom going much harder screaming sorts shit like the sad part bros seem think rather russian operation mean people trying argue ones goal turn sanders supporters thus sow division that point get act bots sybil sock puppet would accurate term whatever make everyone thinks drive conforming antisocial behavior so many miss though frustrating 
energizing african american base would energy better spent imo if enough turned hillary wins we need motivated year they sure hell turn bernie 
why think russian want bernie win would really bad putin 
lmfao accusing bernie supporters russian assets somehow media narrative sanders toxic ones how anyone buy 
maybe hopefully changes tone stops attacking joe sees writing wall 
maddow msnbc stating sen sanders step aside gracefully join defeating clown court senate at least gleaned interview apparently which sounds right since side 
think decent opportunity bernie wild enough give attention issues paying so lots great candidates wanted move party left without devisive bitter towards coalition need win but tried make seem like evil republican shills progress best ideas slowed idea work people get shit done 
this warren voter spent years advocacy candidate plan vision temperament make happen hate much malarkey become major distraction issue makes bernie platform attractive millions people voting he hardly natural politician good man right side history long popular joe wrong lot issues neither perfect come baggage easy see ones left standing looking forward nominee take conservatives

also pete supporter just wanted say hi rotr 
team pete roll call just stopping say agree whole heartedly 
it's good idea i'm surprised biden already something like 
most bernie supporters end voting clinton general and ended campaigning right angry loss sudden wounds still raw expect might weeks goes negative however day sanders endorse biden ok result but let come terms denial anger first two stages grief eventually get acceptance we need back work 
yep stay away they're really bad mood 
rules road give space grieve it want place 
there's many insane delusional posts politics every thread gets gold top visible read shake head nonsense 
probably best avoid sub altogether lol 
the dnc going alternate young voters people support someone champion 
this philosophy foundational explicitly stated rules naturally 
don discount possibility could berners playing games the coalition built end loss picked clean bros would hope none us liz supporters 
we tolerate please report incidents us sending message moderators we'll take care 
thousand times started harris supported warren team biden supporting sanders never even consideration toxic campaign supporters 
guys get fucking bullshit literally reason voted slightly different flavor progressive someone else sound alarm know help much god utter crap i'm sorry

when script doesn't go planned 
not politics right bernie fans giving biden second look talk win 
and bernie one heart attack 
the shit happen trump supporters clamoring debate biden 
i'm bernie supporter like biden think anyone really debate expected falter thought better least list talking points glad shifting bit progressive biggest hang also liked they're committed supporting nominee honestly look personally fundamental differences way want achieve thing 
bernie looked little sick tbh no one running looks good seem rather okay ages 
biden amazing last night my kid buttigieg quoting day 
did post get linked pro bernie discord something there's like comments sanders supporters trying concern troll 
lose sorry i'm brigade anything subbed sub open likely possibility biden winning nomination feel familiarize policy result like win it smackdown bernie's supporters wanted means either side came across reasonable little sleazy times bernie revolutionary angry though seem try tone done bit support acknowledge nominee barring extraordinary circumstances i'll reluctantly general election regardless position think calling debate anyone would extreme call 
think need kind toxicity rn 
nutty idea two loser becomes vp running mate got popular candidates ticket uniting dem party 
it's time unite party whoever wins dem nomination gets vote biden first choice i'm pete supporter but bernie same how nominee win presidency fighting two battles one within trump 
would think winning debate people ask stumble wtv pretty easy i'm european gonna vote opinion literally value anyway 
biden you superpacts bernie no dont want name go ahead whatever 
how world anybody figure biden debate serious question the man lied teeth 
yeah debate thread many refusing vote general pointing fingers moderates my head explode 
there two biden hit pieces front page bernie gets praise pivoting stump speech hardly answering corona questions 
politics considered serious objective source news considering influx unchecked bernie brigading consistently goes refer super tuesday next zero mentions biden wins engage time dispel dnc conspiracy theories utter fabrications outside relied unbiased information 
saw bidenwon trending twitter well 
saying politics couple days ago biden best person debate 
this hilarious unless state vote yet fine support bernie but voted second look trump biden 
well enough campaign hours discharged confident mental physical stamina fully undertake rigors presidency wrote martin lewinter attending cardiologist university vermont medical center https www google com au amp cnbc bernie sanders releases medical history heart attack html 
mean trump looked bad every debate smart trend continue 
i'm glad bernie shifting biden bit progressive biggest hang it's pretty amazing left whole platform shifted since honestly give credit minimum wage college tuition public option though others issue he definitely impact 
wondering super pacs joe mentioned looked here links case anyone interested https www opensecrets org presidential race candidate outside spending id bernie the largest pac supporting spent far and million for almost million less surprised since said yesterday trying get big money poilitics understand general trump folks go full court press part support 
meme came across lol guy replied alluded non biden supporter gets offended something almost certainly someone going vote joe matter 
the type voter would loudly announce never voting biden going reddit getting offended meme reliably vote anyways there small vocal minority bernie bros list cause dems sit elections jill stein energy spent wasted focus instead obama lost nevertrump republicans those people they reasonable members political conversation persuaded using core principles candidate stands 
yeah need keep letting people openly hate us walk someday we'll accrue enough niceness points they'll give votes 
understand sentiment think meme really bad imo attacking bernie personally calling supporters names it's simply stating expectation they'd get clearly based polling information if show post violates rules road though i'll 
you say post history shows entirely pro bernie anti biden so mean berniebros like faces rubbed fact keep losing wrong 
we america baby nation it worked horribly 
yeah bernie's supporters hilariously terrible job lowering expectations biden going debate 
yeah that's lower expectations opponent debate 
disagree think joe needed lot order considered win though imo pretty good it's prevailing sentiment among sanders' supporters would get stomped bernie supposed cognitive decline lack stamina exposed addition getting routed policy they positive going joe's downfall result complete opposite 
also wanted hear biden finish it mix pacs superpacs dark money functionally thing regulated differently donation caps disclosing donors sunrise movement dream defenders center popular democracy action people our revolution democratic socialists america make road progressive democrats student 
one majority democratic party lives guess 
yes https twitter com natesilver status 
https projects fivethirtyeight com biden sanders debate poll 
lots bernie bregaders tonight y'all mad somethin' 
those people either vote voted trump nothing satisfy 
don worry politics it somehow even less real life twitter 
if primaries far indication people probably bothered vote anyway 
i've seen since bernie started run the dsa announced going endorse anyone 
got couple discussions wasted bunch time trying convince blue matter and checked profiles fucking chapos if somebody posts chapostraphouse lost cause 
there many foreign trolls problem brainwashing american voters we take overtake forum its technically bernie subreddit suppose politics general i'm saying post anything negative even pro joe yet whomever democrat nominee remind people important vote 
to fair lot bernie folks know register democrat vote most category would never voted corporate democrat at point think obvious need parties if disenfranchised people could get public funding better discussion issues 
voted bernie early stupid alzheimer's attacks biden fans outraged converted full supporter the extremely disrespectful want part group would freely spread bullshit 
bots the comments much even keel politics anyway 
http np reddit com politics comments fjlamt debate coach biden best night date 
you're right objective interesting see something pro bernie discussed relatively civil manner 
quite states voted yet being biden sub encouraged sanders voters thinking switching candidate support edit also add shouldn't encouraging party unity general 
seriously doubt stating sanders supporters swayed politics support biden going impact actual vote and sincerely hope threat trump picking scotus federal judges would enough incentive vote blue 
i'd bet money trump skips debates 
specifically mix pacs superpacs dark money functionally thing regulated differently sunrise movement dream defenders center popular democracy action people our revolution democratic socialists america make road progressive democrats student bernie supporters want win support stop gaslighting we're stupid 
he referring our revolution dsa pacs 
he listed watching debate mom us went 'list top lungs 
know what hell happened edit why get deleted 
come give break lets make back forth politics during debate 
speaks passion bad ideas worth biden fuck bernie brother 
that problem trump going win without bernies supporters joe lose 
going lay pretty clearly hardcore progressive bernie support here's true still biased way us talks walking walks no you need make real change appeal people there's really reason vote biden trump like that's basic fact fine guy he's smart enough especially liked debates ago aware things like enumerated rights etc but give it's literally could fill sc spot obama failed guess helps look stable mean improvement suppose low bar my never anything party try well decided as long progressives continue democrats current fashion completely ignored so slow death medical debt fascist dictatorship what's difference at least loses maybe finally fucking accept non base instead telling fuck every election understand point young go impossible deny primaries latest example viewpoint ignores general election many independents often something system continually trying campaign resulted strong defeat republican specifically say bill clinton would without ross perot crushing primary suddenly electable kingmaker endorsement south carolina major parts moderate wing going endorsing right st total lack unity entire senate jesse jackson refusing endorse opportune times good win none shows that get they want change this continues lose elections want learn 
democrat first foremost like former vice president believe removing trump priority my disdain neoliberalism secondary needs united states remember long biden second choice bernie supporters 
haha comrade he year old physician voters 
but personally biden supporter celebrate much either make meme 
mean definitely worst case scenario joe really hard define last night win 
think best explanation people giving win pulling ahead debate blow call toss either since sanders always bit better biden also italy dig unnecessary might proven short sighted us tackles coronavirus even worse i'm staying possibility 
you know debate looking subs they angry fuck celebrating 
this post hit front page i've never seen sub i'm downvoting everybody think count brigadier idk supporters mad anything bernie wiped floor biden simple 
it twitter instead hot girls know talking passive aggressive nerds social skills 
i've noticed lot posts criticizing sanders deleted 
third party weirdos they problems plagued bernie's campaign many fringe ideas unable build coalitions trying grassroots movement top running president instead local elections 
bernie supporters treated fine especially compared lots literally anyone else 
go vote polls matter predictions we need wins margin victory vote 
also aware voting always important my state connecticut april th town referendum whether appropriate money build new water tank therefore joining many today electing joe biden extremely everything matters vote every chance it truly able exercize government people rather showing years vote big ticket races even pick president take oppertunity urge yes happen live go but also 
yes winning state means pretty much nothing it literally grabbing many delegates possible every vote everywhere matters 
good point the polls assume vote its pointless faster win party heal focus trump 
so true every single vote sends strong message uncontested convention 
got polling place michigan literally person vote 
yes vote issues local candidates referendums 
sharing story shared day ess on sunday friend mine passed away cancer far far young age we even truly close met brother law ever interacted facebook wedding but always funny interesting takes passionate smart measured he older seemed much wise year difference tried heed free advice offered posts the last thing posted days ago core idea all agree many us first part i'm putting may vote sanders warren washington primary week expect biden general election really hope become nominee this nightmare must end in thread defended voting multiple folks slandering biden's name liked progressive politics bernie purist understood stake maybe better since anyway needed reason eric devoting rest fight trump to give outcome lived see getting ass handed

hey vote lib dem labour next time assuming gets new leadership 
know said regarding subject do article read 
alt right troll ignore move along 
it either special referendum today our primary april th we also usually annual town budget early doubt combine election referendim combined anything this question thing ballot 
really got nothing worth huh 
if trump wants talk nepotistic corruption let's 
and biden like look fuck kids actually 
prefer voting election day polling station literally block house remind every single friends go vote social media pic 
https www reddit com joebiden comments fdp km bernie supporters coming ask bernie cannot win general election his electability mirage 
sure i'm happy share honest opinion dislike sanders candidate he's old poor health divisive revels conflict attacks democrats exactly endearing washington insider years congress little show likes pretend he's outsider millionaire non democrat decided would run democrat day wanted president try take resources dnc rather independent also trying shit words find dishonest hack think absolutist stances ridiculous as doctor stance medicare actually poorly thought accelerate negative changes occurring healthcare system his protectionist isolationist worsen retreat national stage ideologue trust cognitive flexibility required good leadership supporters disproportionately jackasses there's reason either draw best people worst like trump draws so bad vote someone general i'd able but one loud jackass another 
if team operate effective anti propaganda campaign relentlessly attack trump every angle could convince undecided left lesser two evils disclaimer not saying biden playing devils advocate 
conservative party member voted boris lead tory last summer lib dem barely point labour socialist bernie moderate economic failure dangerous uk conservatism basically democrats trump extreme tories like policies 
that's good way ensure low turnout 
would prefer actual healing historically dem's strength biden sanders warren making even harder usual 
makes sense my polling station literally five minute walk driveway church but early voting place nice public library like going lot 
just stating fact they year apart age voids argument 
thank responding we different views think either us moved position your surprising view dishonest whilst understand opposing policies liking stands would thought apparent least honest consistent can ask believe biden sanders or lesser two evils scenario and downvoted literally asked question the toxic supporters issue candidates included 
revels conflict citation missing leader shy away is good thing you want pussy like office attacks democrats exactly endearing loyalty party stupid millionaire likes pretend he's barely one unimpressive financial situation further forgot citations as doctor think stance medicare actually poorly thought accelerate negative changes occurring healthcare system experts every first world country disagree just say mean upset bottom line feeder his supporters also disproportionately jackasses look mirror get head ass sanders trump draws worst appeals trash best us don't mad better person trying lift helping people shit you're good course stern going help anyone else vote old loud divisive ideologue jackass trust another looks since fucked primaries badly far 
conservatives may closely aligned democrats boris johnson still problem he trump lite new labour clinton tony blair bros left office bush balls iraq 
well put sandwich board signs around town sent official notice mail everyone guess whatever happens 
local issues tend done like my school district loves bond special election ballots 
shit seen many former competitors race endorsed biden we're bringing country together fast whiplash 
they asked dislike sanders like biden my first choice primary pete buttigieg partly age biden's negative factor none problems bernie 
and downvoted literally asked question the toxic supporters issue candidates sanders biden included this dishonest best sure an overwhelming majority coming one candidate every non bernie supporter noticed even warren talked maddow recently 
if honest feel would run independent rather trying leech dnc democratic establishment simultaneously railing other areas dishonesty young people certainly show vote actually happening magical voter surge somehow override roadblocks congress unrealistic everyone dislikes in stated never democrat hypocritical that's fine take nonsense elsewhere stop running president pretending https www politico com magazine story bernie sanders democrats 
and downvoted literally asked question the toxic supporters issue candidates sanders biden included this joe subreddit what think would happen supporter went gotv thread wanted reject upvotes of course it'd probably quite heavily downvote call toxicity toxicity warren's recent tweet coronavirus mention presidential primary brigaded nasty comments almost entirely one particular candidate tell candidate's fact know exactly without looking problem 
why stuff like get downvotes 
by means continue perhaps opinion sanders supporters angrily ranting changed angry 
new labour better socialist still went commit war crimes also boris way like democrats trump trump lite hair lmao 
hahahahaha yikes okay you sound exactly entranced bernie bro trumper come man 
holy fuck someone stupid become doctor please quit lack concern intelligence competence kills one patients you know patient already want kill poor 
understand would argue calling dishonesty misjudgement appreciate viewpoints 
look previous response everyone needs understand everyone else coming requires rational discussion supporters different candidates think want bernie need lot vote joe general gets nomination downvoting anyone disagrees way drive unity this absolutely also true bernie's 
it hair he fervent supporter brexit movement based nationalist ideas trump stirs wall they populists jeremy corbyn bad make boris johnson good 
voter turnout time compared last but sure yeah whatever believe want man i'm gonna stop 
fair play civility i'd love see like wish prominent folks every dem candidate race civil honourable 
actually biden really need bernie supporters win november he needs real democratic base along moderate independents republicans those undecided voters cnn likes trot there undoubtedly right thing vote plenty stay home protest 
nationalism way stronger trumps policies the tories brexit supporter want bring back good ol days eu places many restrictions us transformation political union unelected officials making decisions uk interests mind signed imo hate europe simply disagree difference 
no need held hostage group win 
ira non existent point suitable sustainable situation established irish sea 
as long sides uphold end bargain leave northern ireland middle sure 
omg chortled thank joe biden community making former pete supporter feel welcome can't explain much helping mend broken heart take us home uncle 
not gonna lie actually made ticket campaigned pb would immediate unconditional support care healthcare plan outlawing hospitals economic stimulus involved monopoly money 
think would great match joe needs someone young energetic policies slightly left say right but unfortunately he'll choose vp diversity points 
reminded obama biden pete cute together 
how could forget https thenypost files wordpress com biden obama jpg quality strip 
many times heard pete talk picking vice president important think would happen country died office not fun thought incredibly one you need ready govern day this paramount decisions going forward biden bernie supporters optics damned looking seamless transfer unity 
love pete think ticket vp diversity important us since older white man lead would vital young female minority either kamala stacey abrams sure i'd gladly vote however 
think happen though not vp but pete something 
yes agree with really one exception i've made very welcome teamjoe love the goes slack people awesome it means lot instituted pete's rules road they thoughtful welcoming 
think buttigieg pence debate could really excellent actually mean joe already winning diverse group supporters needs college educated whites suburbs pete appeal need 
he probably considering they're going run need 
for if wins primary diversity points mean lot less general 
of potential vp picks obviously like pete would levels excitement stacey abrams 
unfortunately that's correct wish he'd pick pete vp though would make things interesting help tame hard left swing otherwise might experience future 
biden one big dem candidate get away non poc vice he already black people vote

thank request comrade jillanco said word yet 
they would probably really go pete could point exactly pence statewide policy affected life south bend mitigate negatives 
pete one getting republicans jump ship especially midwest where joe absolutely win biden buttigieg could well winning ticket 
i'm opinion abrams unknown nationally significant boost biden know make southern states flippable right the midwest possibly texas prizes decide 
perhaps party still like optics think would poc diversity necessarily vote if anything progressive leaning candidate hopes making easier bernie bros biden general to knowledge kamala abrams either is female 
not love ticket friend dc works campaigns told me secret 
if ever use word knows tells everyone it quick way weed racists conversation 
she unlikeable rather stacey abrams warren biden compromise would ideal 
lmao sounds like alex jones undisclosed nasa scientists feeding info 
alright but also want mindful one productive disagreements conversations racists well it exact mentality listen word say said something like destructive functional democracy understand almost bad gets even people need characterized immediately this meant dismiss cancel

we might agree solutions problems climate change economic inequality universal healthcare etc 
we need enemy plese spread tour fellow bernie bros tbis together 
welcome bernie ran helluva race and probably pushed biden left his run vain 
thank welcome despite rivalries divisiveness typical primary end team now time unite behind joe yes bernie's voice platform must also heard 
also warren bernie guy rally joe lets win this election far important divided 
come hug feel better team get work 
bernie supporter writing wall since last week time kick orange clown curb 
absolutely agree before shed many tears take look biden's position issues https joebiden com joes vision you might realize progressive lead believe 
welcome cookies seriously though trump biggest threat happy board 
thank this cannot stated enough even though disagreed much sander campaign would voted matter process 
welcome aboard you stop loving bernie vote joe 
while gut wrenching get preferred candidate i'm fully board biden elected want rbg retire live days peace that women one heroes let's shit done november united stand divided fall 
welcome anyone willing support nominee cool and someone consider berniebro pejorative sense 
now need convince bernie bros thing tell go vote general election like think general biden want years trump 
you totally right for think slower pace progressive programs biden represents look past see trump the left absolutely heard admin warren convert believe joe 
welcome we going win together 
welcome bernie ran hell race excited see biden work together take trump 
voted bernie well happily vote biden there going lot anger next like last week two supporters young may participated politics so losing new thing as winning primary general candidate since bush party switch case anyone wondering used us supported reliving for though hurt bad time never fan hillary hold nose sucked joe good guy even agree positions feel conflicted voting certainly trump opposition 
people fail realize joe may enact progressive agenda bernie because deliver senate can't you see based motivated vote any dem president house ton legislation if angry got white able get anything enacted even democrats congress dislike put mildly moreover centrists mostly less exit polling showing people support reality pragmatists concerned winning first party loudly demonstrating know swing voter peers would lose fall the fact thinking completely foreign voters says we're living bubbles internet broken wants lifelong dream he's talked term he said day bridge new generation young leaders going let run policy and they'll place future 
no longer bernie bro brother let's beat trump 
honestly think supreme court favor conservatives the best composition possible but i'm conservative vote democrat really like whole living document idea notion acting pseudo legislative branch ideally liberal law makers lawmakers push progressive agenda tells they're line 
welcome let get ready take back country 
hope brothers rational this fight bigger biden bernie it soul nation years dt america longer know 
if think trump bigger threat progressive values biden mistaken friend history shows leftist political movements undermined empty promises centrist incrementalism this progresses majority population deeply unsatisfied status quo that's fascism slips it happened time the spanish civil war perfect example greatest country right promise bring us back normalcy going end badly bernie last shot changing course history electoralism start investing dual power finding alternative ways defend tides neoliberalism lead place and meander face climate change ecocide perpetual growing income inequality prison industrial complex colonialism imperialism all things propped neoliberal agenda played central role fortifying five decades he ilk led ugly moment let radicalize rather despair find local group learn skills share partake mutual aid support actual candidates option build community cave pressures mainstream discourse leads disaster 
love positivity thread people really think bernie can't win feel like fence went worry trump getting second term cents though 
unity politics sounds horrible tho kids jumped cliff kinda way 
wait bernie brothers arms able unleash full fury worst president history 
as current bernie supporter wanted give joe chance recommend people page it literally actual policies talking points that one worst websites seen regards wants get done 
couldn't even view policies without donating wtf 
hey out cold getting lonely old feel 
joe admitted willing change anything though we setting another trump future telling room donors nothing fundamentally sound progressive 
the living document interpretation literally founding fathers envisioned it john marshall wrote must remember constitution expounding one applicable future generations meaning foundational could never considered exhaustive idea society held strict confines something written years ago codified ownership human beings ludicrous face novel advanced would use deny rather confer liberty 
you realize minorities voted biden right and hillary 
you helping anything vote blue matter 
even though come house rant we're going make america better place people like you're angry we get biden sure rbg's fight vain he's climate change addressed when catch breath take look positions bet find know followed reddit stream media boogeyman told 
and bernie can't beat biden win trump 
look dr rachel bitecofer her model shows absolutely it's turnout much less swinging voters previously believed she's interesting may give confidence biden supporter anything explains lot uphill battle trump 
no longer bernie bros blue 
click text says continue joebiden com 
well look turnout people enthusiastic vote there country full people differing opinions outside reddit 
the document says there process amend interpreting however please never intention maybe clear disdain living theory zero issues amending constitution believe necessary travel ages but opinion many others role supreme court reenvision words court interpret originally intended when changes needed go requisite instead seems sides aisle relying pseudo legislative body ramrods new interpretations easier actually accumulating support 
yeah kinda shows need pull certain community leaders suddenly biden obama black association huh 
helping i'm supporting corruption bernie voted popular vote go war iraq 
damn straight every vote every state november reckoning coming 
maybe clear disdain living document theory and maybe originalism invented whole cloth last years ignores consistent unwavering precedent constitution provides general framework rather exhaustive set powers federal government rights people from fucking unanimous decision marshall court contain accurate detail subdivisions great admit means may carried execution would partake prolixity legal code could scarcely embraced human mind it probably never understood public its nature therefore requires outlines marked important objects designated minor ingredients compose deduced that idea entertained framers american inferred instrument language why else limitations found th section st article introduced also degree warranted omitted use restrictive term might prevent receiving fair interpretation in considering question must forget expounding but i'm sure know john oliver wendell holmes louis brandeis less every single influential jurist concoct constitutional support revanchist political ideology to confederate monuments hell intended anything marginalize marginalized 
african american voters savvy intelligence practical electorate they know joe what even talking 
mainly taking saying voting trump vote democrat democracy depends 
we'll see doesn't seem like good night bernie 
i'm talking candidate lifetime work poor disenfranchised oppressed that bernie sanders while joe biden barack obama vice president what's talk

here's serious depth take post campaign era https twitter com jysexton status biden winning states never stepped foot operation ads trailing recently large margin we it started full bloom contests determined media coverage prevailing narrative 
our revolution completely opaque superpac flowing far largest amount dark money race 
joe biden hire michigan challenge literal female college student 
this best meme seen yet well done genuinely lol 
maybe people realize might possible reason bernie seems following among younger voters older past decades learned see old politic nonsense peddling years 
whenever question policy detail bernie camp frames immoral inhuman attack makes huge promise things anyone ask pay always counter either turning answer moral ethical argument high horse make evil billionaire tenth wall street banks healthcare industry etc now like trump time he responded maga mexico mean running get rid trying become but third less often used respond that burn burn we rise ashes it way 
bernie we mobilize new voters come record numbers new vote joe wait like 
harder organize revolution offer security status quo suppose 
how taking money various corporations considered without the underlying implication also biden less given voters last checked donors give presidential candidates expectation return companies expect policies written behalf recoup profit and people well bit right 
yep they hire coalition staffers lis smith anyone 
that's one reason pete's comms team getting merged big boost joe lis helped build whose ground game second none they less virtually anyone field 
there's talk bloomberg's full operation resources behind handed biden 
but man imagine good ground game those words gave orgasm 
he's raised shit ton money recently he'll fine he much anything pay people 
really think super overblown primaries lot different general if want win trump going need strong ground game sophisticated campaign organization pete help us his incredible iowa nh hopefully lis come advisors bloomberg despite failures candidate built incredibly like done stuff biden build something similar willing throw money really like odds 
mean news information literally travel speed light ground game definitely helps get message wide net without everything old fashioned traditional method pete proved joe proving right 
there's copious amounts research efficacy campaign voter outreach in aggregate person increase turnout now years past well it's ton that said many elections within margin 
yeah always funny inundated bernie youtube reddit instagram recall last time saw biden ad yet one saying beholden commercialism please explain dua lipa endorsement 
no worked biden built relationships decades it's clyburn endorsed buttigieg klobuchar voters knew comfortable also sanders someone without biden's resume done might able opponent different edit apparently get serious i'm tired can't take joke 
is last line actually good thing 
actually think campaigns still matter but downballot races states organization must intense voters demand early primary large presidential contests no doesn't much 
true important go well joke 
fact their list donors entirely voluntary validated whatsoever you put whatever like including anonymous transparency 
it's super pac just factual distinction and spent anything cycle https twitter com ourrevolution status obviously could disbelieve tweet they'd immensely stupid risk getting caught lie like 
it's dark money group super pac super pacs reveal donors 
we definitely need michigan showing strong feel fairly representative rest rust belt give us indication nominee also democrats trump 
college dropped high school due chronic anxiety sleep problems getting guy joe other young supporters exist 
younger voters old enough remember days soviet union 
can specific what's example nonsense 
or they'll make numbers bernie constantly says plan cost trillion here's truth https www cnn com politics bernie sanders plans bottom lines index html during cnn town hall monday provided back envelope ledger costs programs he'd pay even generous estimation using sanders' estimates possible friendly none add least new government spending years for guy talks lot billionaires funny he's willing fudge billion 
he barely ground offices st states also spent much money ads 
just dollar ads california's vote 
if say donate bernie foreigner unit chunks came donations well mathematically would saudi arabia what explain noise please lol 
because grass roots donations must conspiracy 
um joke i'm getting why would saudi arabia back he's threat oil exports truth less donation average his campaign made second preset option site the first people go read https www bustle com articles bernie sanders might exactly says 
biden's super tuesday win bloomberg funded 
look actual spending numbers joe spent small fraction everyone else 
he st running bloomberg stop lying 
we fight stable progress saying we're status quo malarkey 
well mean security starts look incredible failed reality tv star public ally mocking people abusing office picking judges radically pro life believe creationism etc status quo looks like million miles right direction and also minimum wage health option addressing climate change decriminalizing weed making community college free really status 
every viable candidate accepts money pacs these legal transparently operated started candidates on hand bernie sanders start dark group named our revolution https www usatoday com story opinion todaysdebate bernie sanders campaign revolution editorials debates unlike refuses disclose donors amount donations if asking how common cause filed formal complaint commoncause org press release common cause files pro violating soft ban federal elections committee read shadow provides super pac support scorns apnews bbd af cfb fa ab 
completely unrelated kill warrens store team help joe his needs serious work lot want buy wanted everything warren sold better graphics better ideas etc 
pete comms team bloombergs data ops it like coalition building campaign staffers 
give examples bloomberg hast done 
bernie indeed outspent biden media almost million that's largely much larger funds relative total spending they've spent around respectively sources https www opensecrets org presidential race expenditures id another reason seen nothing probably campaigns target likely voters for younger people use social media similarly he's targeting older tv radio as dua lipa assume likes lmao 
this post merely joke link interesting absolutely mean dismiss hard work went campaign joe biden staff maximized every opportunity made extremely valuable connections spite much money ground force 
it's neither fundamentally good thing bad reality 
they matter popular former vice president everyone already knows 
for sake narrative well michigan pennsylvania wisconsin florida think going problem though based poles sanders praising castro things like lol but need take away campaign the narrative he'll win swing states democrats general election 
education fix your username jewish 
well he's positions entire years congress there two bills got passed time one renamed post office veterans bill 
you know nobody knows this impossible predict 
his plans bunch trumpish magical thinking except trump says something crazy base laughs when bernie like remake billion dollar heath care system executive order followers believe 
our current federal tax trillion year spending so next years doubling borrowing every 
that keep climbing many days late mail provisional conditional ballots counted joe ca election day voters there's even small chance could win way officially called when says reporting means precincts but nowhere near so joe's numbers 
yeah almost like election interfered foreign countries years really remember it bernie name literally mueller report page russian troll farm ira indictment know though forgot ancient history 
such strange number see bunch donation amounts even numbers multiples article nothing helps understand amount also yeah good point oil thing bernie gonna beat trump know biden thread supporting because actually win have noticed gop people fucking russian media etc want primary cause pretty obvious probably think easy path victory remember couple weeks ago meddling campaign if foreign adversary watching american election year get puppet elected benefit sending weaker candidate general fuck not mention represents kind dems hrc putin fan 
if would read see addressed it still excuse fact fucking donation amount multiples even numbers magic number does make sense still 
we fight staple progress i'm glad we're wrong side office supplies anymore 
its incremental progress part i'd consider criticizing approach climate change and said remember president prime legislator thats leaders congress hope warren lesser extent bernie part hopes biden generally pass get thru president instead face country takes lead foreign policy crisis management managing everyday regulatory agencies fixed day tbh 
top dollar individual donations ranging sounds like oligarchs 
for part super pacs people criticize taking money right 
bloomberg's social media game point if pick choose best part everyone's campaign would incredible 
pete great store stuff well especially like hired folks palette design obama everything boot edge style think chasten lot input considering he's obviously part couple sense subject pants pre imagine baggy slacks 
bloomberg's data operation really great analytics useful resource allocation strategy buy literally everything 
beto helped deliver texas amy gift wrapped minnesota joe pete state since indiana come yet instead gave the power of lis 
bloomberg saturated tv radio airtime slick professional ads sent lot nice rather persuasive mail going forward huge ad buys reach middle americans especially year cov fears limit door canvassing public rallies 
thanks yeah think older millennial student left university environment always considered progressive but supporting buttigiege biden klobuchar made feel uncool right current location 
sorry came harsh getting late 
yea im really worried florida fully agree think michigan somewhat indicative states 
that rebuttal claim supposedly objective journalist health care plan would cost trillion ten years sanders politely saying pulled number ass 
yah different good old trump wisdom and mexico pay that true political 
when say wants pass medicare all executive order 
the thing countries advanced nations universal healthcare system done less money so disingenuous say can't sure people choose problem like if that's stance fine say we medicare all want but saying it's impossible bullshit 
andrewyang one brightest minds comes challenges face fourth industrial revolution i'm honored endorsement look forward working ensure every worker succeed changing st century economy 
biden actually bringing yang's platform based old dogs learn new tricks 
biden always praised andrew yang 
once biden declines nd term unless i'm yanggang sure hope yang gets cabinet position least 
anyone who's joe biden supporter come yang gang previously supporting pete amy liz please go yang's twitter let know guys welcome he assailed non stop toxic berners berner infected yanggangers calling terrible insults like conman sellout liar he's clearly emotionally graciously accepting thanks thought would great see supporters camps yanggang welcoming andrew make feel better endorsement to right thing broadening coalition hopping onboard joeggernaut 
yang biden got dragon energy 
would put yang charge digital national security stuff ignored really bigger threat nuclear war opinion let guide bye don team social media trade craft short term he hacked primary talent engineering and teach open pdf jack 
welcome yang gang team pete saved seat 
yang gang way it's time get biden house 
started deeply skeptical yang grew throughout campaign his thoughtfulness commitment policy innovation decency willingness explore bold ideas admirable i'm happy he's going forward us 
oh yeah yang way reasonable people give credit he's crazy edgy sake optics unlike 
joe bringing together coalition america best brightest tackle head challenges nation faces it truly beautiful 
joe needs include every one candidates government 
ubi probably never get implemented us hope 
welcome yang gang warren supporter happily come team joe the biden campaign room us let fix america together 
gonna vote because adult understand concept immediate harm reduction but nothing exciting guy at he milquetoast and reality know lot debate slowing enough concerned 
love everyone's surprised guy who's almost years knows good politician he win support 
biden starts wearing math pin 
hope adopts yang's plan establish department technology install none yang secretary 
hi yang gang said months biden concerned th industrial revolution engaged andrew this political signaling knows talking agrees diagnosis talks little endorsement https youtu hla ipuxeu 
thought considering running nyc mayor 
biden already said running one term 
as yang gang literally every camp's supporters friendly respectful except bernie's lol thanks warmth consideration though 
think yang cares knows issues nearly much economy ubi type stuff he's digital security expert 
nope klobuchar warren harris proved get things done senate yang pete fresh ideas bernie years prove nothing show he terrible cabinet secretary spouting congress pass plans courts keep overturning anything and undermining biden constantly 
do honestly think bernie would even accept second banana position see happening 
think sanders warren like senate they running president there's things important know booker klobuchar harris gillibrand bennet might 
eh see near future especially period full employment it take backseat worker retraining programs etc but even milton friedman favor called negative income tax though utilizing different delivery mechanisms effectively quite similar ubi 
clinton actually considering back right time run she basically needed yang done introduce public discussion completely new idea election sanders debated seriously now imagine happens get cash stimulus coronavirus we've got ubi consciousness plus bunch going everyone people might start want money every month 
well yang indeed intelligent he getting near perfect scores standardized tests someone said iq around 
i've focused everything possible win freaking election time really look biden candidate his speech last night made feel genuine admiration 
i'm still holding hope yang gets vp spot think it'd strategically perfect tbh if that's possible yeah 
same or director office science technology already exists stripped trump 
as new yorker really hoping runs mayor 
perfect springboard potus nyc mayor race years election 
he considered and decided at least 
the gang considering people thought meant yang 
lot voters know it vp pick important people whoever picks likely nominee hopefully 
haha also yanggang if checked account history now hoping yang vp c'mon joe 
that's good point know enough ubi economy stuff speculate thinking someone follow closely one level knows technology effective leader digital national security team would bolster resume especially considering future higher office 
bernie's successes championing causes medicare climate change debt relief agree tactically he's effective strategy achieve goals good objectives at least participation bernie people platform the public option go date carbon neutrality moved biden move towards marijuana legalization rather decriminalization university tuition wavers extended etc 
know mean every time biden starts talking like we're going verbal adventure sometimes destination really nice 
it's productive right focus like bernie supporters focus bring along board coalition that's built defeat trump 
he'd inagurated mayor it seems bit much get elected serve couple months start campaigning 
it worked well ones tried year 
https www politico com news biden single term can blame he's 
biden least history embracing new information even seeking that alone makes vastly superior imo bernie can't pick idea double decades world changes around 
we tried hillary general election platform moved left they still rose us year biden already progressive viable split congress also remember convince true centrists moderate republicans vote way november appearing far could sway trump abstention voting libertarian 
verbal adventure that's accurate hell 
trump biden tendency spew garbled mess words the key difference spirit 
not love biden glad would retire 
well confirmed apparently campaign research showed it'd hurt general made pledge hear make bit term 
this rumor needs stop biden say https www google com amp nbcnews news ncna would turn president effectively lame duck 
correct in fact yang said biden closest campaign trail promised call nominee and calling every week seems talk th industrial revolution something bernie never mentioned so salty yanggangers many bros endorsed it's delegate math yang's desire quickly unify party also unlike crazy joe taken much effort engaging yea may onboard ubi yet mean ever former top obama economics advisor jason furman recently came support worked overtime case adopting grows stronger heck even aoc previously called trojan horse hours ago light coronavirus lol 
we tried hillary general election platform moved left they still rose us year yep and got seat table changing rules primary accused 'corrupt status quo establishment' regardless offering anything this never negotiate radicals especially whose appeal relies attacking others playing victim 
same mccain discussing make one term pledge decided would harm good personally mind someone wants there's lot done four years but people view quitting trying hard enough 
in mccain case know could done terms who knows 
though stress senator far less president 
he really wreck paul ryan 
but name rural post office checkmate biden 
thanks reminding reddit biden absolutely wiped floor paul ryan time young charismatic congressman think fare fine trump 
but he stutters sometimes so he's unelectable 
like legislative actions ended man's entire career 
it great see encapsulation biden's many legislative accomplishments apologize fellow bernie supporters using past stances social security without regard context awareness joe's progressive approach current platform 
that's man getting good stuff done 
think last time watched vp debate he destroyed palin 
changed mind extremely controversial social topic once sweeps bernie's brady bill vote rug 
you forgot preceded obama favoring legalization gay marriage 
all achievements nothing mullet throughout smh 
and bernie people say record bad seems like establishment wont go gun one what hypocrite 
think fair also bring yes past abortion crime bill turn bad black community favor gay marriage genuinely understand people say years ago candidate thing started good how trust 
so how'd things go detroit anyhow haven't really heard news since robocop statue 
is biden pro universal healthcare if never get precious vote 
not start fights understand main thing beat trump biden policy future excites trouble think bringing anything new table excite voters like legalized weed least something idk 
republican back that debate point knew election would end dude got eaten alive fava beans delightful chianti 
almost the whole time looked like fun guy best line bunch malarkey gave word comeback 
anyone link debate politics back sure referring 
it striking see recently top game also years long time 
better he got amtrak station named then unveiled new alstom avelia liberty train sets 
the intellectual gop time good grief low bar branded 
meanwhile paul ryan recently moved back dc hating us live clearly sees writing wall joe president probably wants set post trump gop movement bring pauly 
possibly one greatest burns politics time 
and thing stuttered debate counted nothing 
if think people questioning joe cognitive decline bad wait general he spotlight longer every gaffe even stutter mocked for years democrats made note trump mental state one second happen it disgusting 
this scene debate libya pretty good https youtu zauyy ioydk iran part eau whdgug on stimulus ryan asking funds www youtube com watch lc ua bq compilation biden laughing dnragmfjw 
bernie sanders guns https www theatlantic com politics archive bernie sanders sex marriage nbcnews election evolved immigration vox policy record explained pristine ideologue held position years fighting good fights he's flawed human thought right like candidates the difference he's candidate running purity 
person evolve time if grewup 's gay accepted like today as gain experience hopefully knowledge stance something marriage change you cynical say position changes political purposes maybe look beliefs think not saying biden's heart came 
as others said keep mind also represented catholic delaware long time also he's abortion even always greatest record decades and yeah crime bill absolutely problematic it supported cbc fairly widespread support same gay marriage obama there's records bernie saying thought civil unions fine believe pro considered death sentence politicians outside california around democratic candidates president favor senators joe ironically went one major figures many big name 
yes and actually pass uncovered americans get covered asap https joebiden com healthcare 
yes expanding healthcare way get congress cover uninured americans excites much also biden policy immigration sick tone immigrants welcome know sexiest issues think president genuine empathy current administration trying change edit forgot big one plan create million jobs renewable energy space it revitalizes industrial midwest helps climate pretty exciting 
i'm actually really excited plan post secondary education depth multi layered tell lot research went make sure comprehensive possible also feasible they link studies use justify think community college valuable path may otherwise struggle pay investment major step towards expanding future it's honestly enthrilling see thought plans most candidates talked vaguely reasons work biden's follow along every part policy level intricacy shows actual care ensuring best american people 
think that's started coming around democrat just fucking trounced ryan 
it beautiful thing ever seen side paul ryan supposed pete buttigieg republicans destroyed like minor annoyance joe 
yeah bet he's never complimented dictator's education system 
leave wilmington head south most state rural 
and honestly wish he'd use line bernie noun verb 'the billionaires' 
single clip biden speaking even bad literally anything trump done past years besides fact almost every specialist would attribute long consistent patterns linked stutter work let bloombito money play goofy gaffe comparison actual dementia neurologists johns hopkins mayo clinic etc pointing mental psychical signs trump's case 
serious question mean offence think he's cognitively declining gaffes stutters one thing every candidate i've watching lot videos joe recently trouble answering basic questions forming full sentences 
clicks first link unmutes immediately thats bunch of malarkey ahhh uncle joe 
yeah paul ryan even live debating joe beyond 
all old debates see never audience is presidential the days horrible would much better without 
you know noticed comment downvoted agreeing thought post rebuttal sanders supporters saying right along pointing biden simply regardless even wrong changed ways 
could link immigration policy thanks 
it help ryan supposed gop wunderkind brilliant policy wonk mind and got destroyed uncle joe 
iirc years since i've seen point openly laughing vicious 
isn largest town southern part named seaford like far sea get southern delaware 
think that'd impact would significant portion block potential democratic voters class conscious seen mocking one two candidates seriously discussed issue it also sets biden get railed positions he's negatively impacted middle 
and agree totally trump supporters low information voters see clips they fox news mock joe hop bandwagon 
oh think absolutely cognitively declining he's essentially hiding last two weeks since moderates coalesced around the next debate catered toward needing go head bernie they'll probably give questions advance like hillary if ends debating trump instead continuing hide he'll fall apart threaten fight threatened someone asking gun rights recently 
no fact characteristic stutter many times delivers excellent rebuttals ryan if think big decline reflects poorly candidates regarded one performers last two debates dem primary season 
he similar speech problems entire life it never stopped delivering strong debate performance past expect stop beating trump 
not sure downvoted if hang though see nearly posts point get hidden pretty know sigh 
sure https joebiden com immigration 
that's sad part ryan was gop's wunderkind brilliant policy wonk he best offer 
began openly laughing paul ryan gq interviewed said favorite band rage against the machine imagine unaware thing hates 
vote third party sorry dumbass 
and democrat republican rule watched cost living reach shameful numbers buuuut thank god billionaires pay lesser tax rate anyone subreddit well except joe biden yet think democrats republicans viable option vote third party make em earn ur vote sorry take political advice people can't even effort use correct spelling 
you definitely vote third party and go join leave alone kay 
live seaford correct probably largest town southern de we hour east ocean nanticoke river feeds chesapeake bay and also pretty much everything south middletown rural small towns coastal communities 
glad realistic conjecture downvoted tf joe's running positive stuff far relieving there's need make bernie look ridiculous without propping shitting trump welcome tho 
okay understand better catering debate people unfair 
oh cross mind that would dirty 
that certainly way win votes 
really trying jerk west ocean 
there seaford li what great name town 
positive stuff far relieving that's really true certain point view most negative talking points put surrogates campaign proxies rather vice president significant problem trying run centrist centrism motivating biden personally someone i'd call progressive this means order strategy work positions candidate attacked otherwise made look ridiculous hence get hilary rosen renew white washing mlk's legacy television exchange black woman expressing opinion suggests decades since actually read letter completely dishonest however least couple major left wing issues seem enjoy ignoring historic stances older politicians often meaning watching clinton avoid explaining whether pre ish believe gay folks rights position public necessity painful abortion marriage variety going rough for like single payer universal healthcare system probably aware historically attempted legislate anything beyond insurance mandate even signed bill gop forward serve counter administration's push aca make floor debate so youngish i'm sitting watching front runner shit bread butter democratic party thirty years heaping praise literally plan tweaks great accept bullshit inefficient half measure inspiring add notion seems think unionists negotiating wages here's hint unions provide health union membership union's real potential sour lot interactions leaders activists and god forbid keeps suggesting remote damn possibility nominating republican the idea spending months everything help win election give presidency moderate harder hill climb saying fuck voting trump also touch experiences millennials stands lose voters voter enthusiasm every time talks policy related economic standing dude able way college summer job weekends dad hooked let spend part weekend trespassing private club beach understands impact policies supported shifted portion overall cost education individual students last children went universities it none traditional career paths combine fact younger within senior staff circles upper middle class better families late nd term obama house low level appointees largely northeast absolute disaster comes appealing largest block united states one frustrating things biden's direction message play strengths turns history liability instead narrative but coming guy spent decade expecting working beau's presidential 
think people connect they're catering it unfair and biden supporters want see win questions criticisms bernie attack hurt general disagree exposure questioning results strongest candidate ready onslaught they'll joe 
of course debate trump substance policy poking jabs administration charismatic things biden still excels bernie would literally come trump calling communist gets red face think realize hard convince americans lived cold war red scare vote socialist it massacre 
no one cares vote we good without bye 
ridiculous effort please vote trump 
excellent points sucks lol whether choice candidate would want best win see really rigging debate way disheartening hell 
uhhhh last checked democrats lost donald trump losers need every vote get lol 
well yeah i'm going vote democratic nominee thrilled candidate flirted idea putting republican ballot vp think taking time consider extent sticking member gop assault core party 
as vote valuable want earn if throw away promote trump it years harmful policies 
not no one interested see ya

bloomberg's trolling trump pretty entertaining 
frankly part wants double joe launch attack ads bernie it could well backfire see beating trump anyway 
well coordinate so bloomberg also really fk messaging know biden camp wants msnbc suggesting last night continue takedown trump letting focus positive message america split though 
that's exact thinking bernie nevada don't get overconfident all happened yesterday party coalesced around biden there's still many states sanders could well there's delegate majority anything happen milwaukee 
don't jinx us he momentum lead by means 
no it still needs earned bernie formidable

bloomberg true democrat except years republican independent lol 
bloomberg become democrat no need turn hero even though happy decision making 
months months already mathematically eliminated winning majority delegates he stayed fucked clinton dropped endorsed realized going able get superdelegates overturn democratic party 
that might bit stretch maybe he's vp pick 
donnie might wish attacked mike ninth richest person world makes personal mission make sure lose job we got troops line now going properly equipped ready war come november 
bloomberg one best mayors nyc ever made much livable place he increased life expectancy improved schools sure crime stayed actively helped minorities know stop frisk mistake done plenty things standing religious freedom build whatever worship wherever city promoted equal opportunity school entrance exams built lot parks bike lanes public infrastructure also leader fighting obesity smoking gun violence compared trump competent private sector well particularly finance software joe biden think great still practical experienced obama vp pass many policies including like legalization lgbt marriage passing affordable care act also big fan free trade deals support sanders idealist rather pragmatist frequently shown unwilling compromise agree goals methods idea equity transfers nationwide rent control wealth taxes becoming normalized protectionist historically immigration politically convenient favor 
oh wow know he'd that would really show solidarity 
if going bernie's policies sure attacking bernie person even though call arms everyone else conducive bringing young progressives fold biden win nomination need eviscerate icon personal level 
bloomberg running attack ads bernie work would help the trump however devote resources attacking joe handle 
no strength get nomination need sanders' people general minimize level frustration anger and there's much material hit trump hitting demonstrates that's enthusiasm lies 
he need with bloomberg race sanders done 
he needs also work ballot dems 
new joebiden 's campaign confirms reviewed ewarren bankruptcy plan closely endorsing proposal said il town hall that's significant shift would largely undo bill two clashed congress 
this great coalition building action gestures like show progressives place biden administration 
this kind joe biden get behind the takes best proposals former competitors brings administration actually enact 
really like kind move joe actually building coalition voices heard 
can't help wonder play win endorsement 
first sign genius ability change one mind way go liz joe 
already cast vote biden today earned 
excellent much better adopt warren's policy proposals appeal left voters sanders's rhetoric 
ahhhhhh glorious thing review evidence admit wrong hardest person what's right this something never see bernie trump edit damn sure always 
and guess elizabeth warren run campaign convention get happen if work people convince ideas 
joe biden master bridge builder hard work today 
all unity giving feels guys 
joe biden willing admit woman's idea right it's refreshing 
nice nice now universal childcare next 
hell yes joe we need look bloomberg greenwood initiative https www mikebloomberg com news economic justice black america 
look functioning adults working together greater good this future want 
cmon inslee's climate plan next 
good stuff need get everyone board 
wonder we'll hear warren endorse biden perhaps waiting tomorrow afternoon debate here's wishin' 
incredibly smart proud biden supporter even last minute thing 
this smart proud biden supporter late glad choice 
it shows willing compromise that good quality leader something currently lack white house 
super important brings progressive wing this smart 
but i've told can't grow politician if felt one way decade ago feel today the negative attack ads make much sense someone candidate also clears warren vp 
ability grow person admit mistakes key quality need next president i'm disappointed warren harris klobuchar yang williamson clinton relieved biden ready willing serve 
joe biden evolves bernie sanders stubborn goat never changes point views 
of course good one we know warren pushed clinton left financial services issues order get endorsement i'm sure what's happening wish could come soon surprised waits bernie drop respect whatever remaining friendship still 
most likely plan endorsing lot merit win win 
yes effort unify wings party 
perhaps definitely going play well sunday's debate bernard would attack warren proxy attacks joe economic recovery liked attaching proposals keep away trying single establishment 
the way phrased makes sound like think bad thing understand 
have best candidates medicare want next 
no bad we obviously want candidate saying exact thing forever even though never accomplished anything substantive congress 
wish felt vote feel betrayed want voted biden least part 
we're far enough along primaries might better wait general endorsements diminishing marginal returns there's point wasting primary season unnecessary 
genuine question i'm immigrant libertarian leaning side yang gang why government involved subsidizing raising family my instinct put firewall decisions believe people asked pay something quite reasonably start want say 
we never listen billionaires comes economic justice being billionaire means one committed perpetuating injustice 
https elizabethwarren com plans bankruptcy reform 
this irrelevant op also sure think gillum would vp link news source toxic 
honestly adopts publicly pushes narrative tomorrow debate completely surprised came endorsed monday time next round primaries finally end nonsense sanders 
oh sorry came way unifying party general election good thing 
that's already plan he supports public option 
do genuinely ideological opposition people able declare bankruptcy debt wish voted bernie trump 
raising children providing safe environment molding good citizens job society parents charge development specific kids obviously everyone benefit raised much support possible including the government merely physical manifestation interests wider 
why one fire department instead competing brands force hospitals emergency treatment people pay even though distorts market making expensive care free avoid cheaper preventive 
we agree believe honestly working way success admired attainable strive create opportunity everyone prosper attack support capitalism communism candidate running office thinks breadlines good complaining proposal attempts create generational wealth breadlines better 
where draw defining line perpetuating injustice versus well one's self flawed system 
being billionaire means one committed perpetuating injustice completely fundamentally disagree i'm going pretend expert specific policy good plan regardless who's also worth i've heard black community voices respect really complement 
we know sanders going drop debate winner he's stay much longer he get crushed week the biden pulls away states wins less relevant looks 
which big reason went joe pete going straight would nigh impossible failure give conservatives ammo deny healthcare decades 
yeah their fault looking like know alls not accomplishing absolutely nothing towards goals lol 
regret vote say feel duped i'll still biden general it means i'm less likely donate deciding working local campaign chapter like bait switch particularly give alms people want one leader seldom yes ideological opposition defaulting student loan debt making grand overtures reduce costs college combination absolution free plan put forward nothing stop corruption waste occurs colleges also disproportionately appeals children parents able prepare which makes whole thing ultimately regressive 
trying really understand underlying political philosophy behind point view where public domain end private begins take molding good citizens example if society large democratically elected representatives decided part citizen spending least years playing little league baseball get first hand familiarity national pastime able manifest government mandate or say even kids decision outside realm families 
nobody deserves anyone else you supporting system allows individuals unequal based something amount good done world that shameful 
seen evidence possible attain billions dollars honestly somewhere along line order scale business degree owner net worth inevitably made unethical immoral decisions take advantage hardships people animals natural resources that exploitative something admired acknowledge theory one operating necessary worldview tends 'zoom out' harm cause easier overlook simply figures balance sheet if time effort oversee make every decision ethically lose competitive edge management continue leading growth trajectory this isnt capitalism vs communism unfettered regulatory provisions reduce exploitation marginalized 
one better society never oneself draw line injustice working good rather neighbor 
mean agree general plan really comparable modern market economy true justice achieved people everywhere equal means must eliminate exploitative system called capitalism 
for people like wondering he'll stay much longer opened five new campaign offices pennsylvania https billypenn com bernie sanders opening joe bidens native pa he's delusional taking convention 
think he'll drop tuesday stay least april th significant delegate gains two points let's really hope drops 
that's really self serving he use money fund ballot candidates instead demanding ego stroked reality powerful dnc 
wow insight important must political strategist 
that's interesting perspective since personal political philosophy deems goal 
at least opposition seems somewhat well founded as college student largely helped reforms unless went bankrupt far pleased plan something shows cares imo lowering costs substantially done separating sports making loans special debt less liquidity helps future borrowers probably every still sinks room board lost wages furthermore tired hearing politicians parents paying family income fairly high end every dollar taken in case thanks insight viewpoint 
maybe particular example little already public schooling mandate society decided important good citizen rolled physical education pretty much equivalent said generalized sense back universal childcare far tell i've never warren supporter i'm less sure plan going replace private child care fill gaps low income families seems like basically option free poverty level capped basically think exists service people need performed market find price point leave poorest segment population it's inherently vulnerable abuse in cases appropriate government step either subsidize regulate provide the degree 'need' may debatable 
mandate play little league providing childcare two completely different things the philosophy comes people helping others paying overbearingly expensive public funds like ubi idea allocate yang's approach seems follow typical social democratic 
we disagree believe hard work results rewards think entitled things others happen exist you put qualifier amount good done world vague argue living working productive life prosperity share family thing respect person equal assets opportunity 
i'm trouble understanding people looking interests immoral is accumulation wealth unjust eyes 
jfc bennie five no means 
think necessarily indicative anything pete amy still actively needed wanted go long campaign right point dropped 
thought venue discuss politics sorry hun 
same like many americans want see government succeed building well running healthcare infastructure first if theoretical design indeed cheaper efficient believe let's go prove that means putting full weight development let private insurance coexist keep bar raiser differentiate serviceability justify higher prices public option 
basically think exists service people need performed so stuff gets tricky first ask define acknowledged reasonable really someone reddit give complete answer but second question one often overlook get point first place go back generation two things looked much different day care far less ton stay home moms child considered luxury couple generations sort licensed trained professional watching toddler might happen lived close vicinity downton abbey kids needed socialize what's changed stagnant wages harder raise family income more women want pursue careers higher rates single mothers sole earner must work maybe also fewer multi generational homes grandparents taking duties buddy mine russian mom move help newborn legal weed possibly higher expectations standards living thing 'affordable' everything else becomes probably givers tighter regulations raising overhead of course changes better mixed add view there's probably lots explore beyond fed gov subsidizes planning decisions and practical political shut conservative arguments real quick find solution government funding pay attitude strong country 
that's less philosophy individual policy how decide public ought pay and importantly asked something much say get 
true neither history staying race way past viable 
it place trump trolls try stir division democratic party nice putin 
having self consistent philosophy probably important typical voter however type policies seem follow social democratic the specific percentage amount public pays kind arbitrary like yang's usd month just 'feels' right doubt anyone come formula apply aid even knowledgable democrats tell 'how much' think ubi attempts push individualistic determination one spends allocation 
yeah i'm hoping bernie maybe learned something could totally wrong course we'll find less week

biden first choice either ready stand behind beat trump welcome aboard 
biden conservative trump every aspect he civil rights act literally supported ww concentration camps he's right wing hawkish foreign policy trade history queer bashing wants cut medicaid social security regularly attacks millennials union workers he's also sexist less mentally stable makes look progressive think going get sanders supporters vote mind 
quick question get pete joe tag 
but can't beat biden sure hell trump this understand saying bernie better chance beating he hillary could possibly 
ditto biden gets votes mine november 
many republican policies help personally cannot part circus republican party maybe one day consider race baiting lies free press transparency lynchpins democracy party pun intended group seeks tear pillar you lose leg whole stool falls 
know downvoted we need unite country matter 
have tried signing obamacare know couple self employed people use sure next enrollment period 
let's see evidence all biden wants cut medicaid ss bashes gay people attacks unions etc and please give us he's also conservative trump if piss edit got nothing 
two weeks ago everyone sure biden beat bernie try speak absolutes comes politics 
on desktop got community tab create post options edit flair 
well plan also congress gets make laws pass universal health care joe sign 
he voted multiple times when 
it's scale one candidate higher automatically beats everyone else ranked lower better comparison boxing plenty boxers gone beaten somebody beat someone lost 
because sum democrat votes elect president there republicans well looking real change see hillary democrats looked trump someone might shake system unfortunately faith misplaced rnc's morality ethics bernie winning split ticket everyone rallied behind biden super tuesday snuff momentum for anything less enough the world watches demonize ideas far left reality we're last nation trying squeeze blood stones i'll vote whoever blue general damn wish voting 
i'm bringing amy's hotdish you 
that every progressive centrist's motto going forward 
see missing something sure there option toggle community theme using firefox 
or maybe could vote candidate already instead hoping plan might congress that hopes thoughts prayers 
said would veto text video https www dailykos com story biden says medicare for all says always knew iraq wmds bamboozled bush 
voting biden voting precursor fight every inch governance long marathon 
as former republican way hell would ever voted bernie lot people right feel republicans want vote someone isnt trump also dont hates everything believe biden candidate promises change compromise importantly civility 
there another chance years given mess trump might better moderate taking heat initial clean moderates blame progressives not satisfying silver lining worth considering in meantime pressuring biden progressive trying kick regressives house senate could allow least progress losing battle mean losing war 
most europe healthcare line biden proposing rather bernie multiplayer structures regulated costs common single payer incredibly rare mostly uk the idea choosing public option we're squeezing water stone would imply best systems world 
democrats republicans want completely different kinds change reactionaries take away social safety net why would republican voters vote bernie 
jaw hit floor joe every single county fl every single one 
he also every county missouri mississippi michigan 
over votes people dropped is reason names removed ballot especially ones ages ago 
it thorough ass kicking as broward county resident mail biden voter proud county state 
all really highlights overestimated bernie sanders's popularity since think pretty clear sanders meteoric rise able juxtapose hillary clinton historically unpopular now facing normal democrat one race weakness abundantly voters lost white rural working class voters appeared returned democratic party hopefully stays way november obama trump states go blue 
sanders got crushed florida so happy hear cuban americans voted castro authoritative dictator apologist 
yeah guess castro cool floridians 
bernie crushed i'm voting biden 
those gator emojis really spot let go joe 
votes cast biden escambia county part fl one woohoo 
amazing support joe's campaign rep support purchase official merch webstore made usa union labor proceeds help fund let's beat trump https store joebiden com 
he currently counties three states last night arizona still lot votes counted could well make said done 
great result joe but sincerely hope point upcoming primaries either suspended delayed this nomination process intents purposes winner race continue puts peoples health risk 
alachua extremely left leaning county university florida located amazed biden 
think expected great win nonetheless if take florida virtually blocks path trump 
oh surprise biden miami dade huge margin it appears praising castro good strategy plan win florida 
people twitter reddit loud way people radical go spamming politics everywhere 
it's florida boomer valhalla sure surprise 
don forget alabama state started south carolina 
absentee early voting ballots would mailed week two go printed 
think drop delegates still play convention likely go joe hopefully so people like pete elizabeth technically suspend campaigns instead race everyone's names appear confuses show follow election 
it would huge waste reprint ballots every time someone dropped totally unpredictable originally printed 
once apply ballot there's unapply process so even someone drops they've met criteria depending state could fee petition number signatures etc stay 
early voting also die hards figured knew joe would win state wanted indicate original pick remain voice party 
some states official process withdrawing name ballot hard deadline the campaign fill paperwork make request state decide 
amen except early voted sunday broward 
proud county state first time everything 
in hindsight many people mistook misogyny support bernie hopefully trump many most votes anti hillary pro if first place he'd performing better clearly case 
agree think another factor may also appetite political revolution higher back coming years obama possibility trump actually winning seemed slim many people idea focused pulling democratic party left appropriate today four looming real scary less willing take risk biden consolidated support low option 
also sanders got disproportionate amount media attention especially beginning wanted interesting race instead covering clinton boost free if gave martin o'malley i'm sure he'd competitive candidate 
nothing respect bernie but self righteous smug condescending supporters not much 
yea drop clearly believes pushing platform far important beating trump 
at least stop giving coverage he's viable candidate 
if bernie i'd pick couple planks platform preferably ones referring social safety net actually living right now call joe say hey bud work ideas stump speech drop today endorse we time candidates campaigning crisis the primaries still need happen especially since statewide local elections happened like supreme court election wisconsin want believe horrible humanity changing see forest trees join team full stop we'll though 
ways bernie sanders still take primary news site desperate clicks 
she big sanders counties panhandle ie northern rural florida 
don forget cuts social security 
ah yes way back weeks ago feel like i've lived several lifetimes since 
front page bernie wins county illinois 
actually donut hole counties went sanders small map 
some names dropped months ago 
when voted person ca beto castro still surprised find every candidate list 
actually pete warren's case drop outs past deadline least florida law anyone drops god sometime december stays ballot even suspend anything it's crazy early send mail ballots 
understand recent drop outs still but every single name if officially suspend months election can't imagine they've printed ballots yet 
agreed ironic though many sanders people insist media remains get the reality like said given undue attention this similar grievances dnc stans complain tipped scales clinton not true even tank there's evidence actually affected outcome fact party rallied around created vacuum allowed nobody outsider step 
unsurprising though majority college students professors 
they banned sub telling support biden he's nominee would rather trump they're democrats they're disruptors 
sanders definitely get none platform enacted trump wins 
biden trump lite we need actual progressive 
if bernie's supporters truly can't distinguish difference biden trump they're lost cause the contrast could stark control scotus nominations progress addressing climate change improving healthcare functioning justice department rational foreign immigration policy end corrupt amoral administration us history well worth voting bernie drops campaign use resources coming weeks huge test sanders' character will make graceful exit stay prominent progressive voice congress attempt desperate pointless ugly last stand try take 
but he'll probably get independent moderate leaning democrats may otherwise vote rd party sane republican look biden's platform back he's offering anything bernie voters want this 'all nothing' mentality huge turn american politics compromise 
looks like bernie getting supporters' votes either wash 
at point want biden able shift focus ge intention appealing bernie busters the people scream establishment ideally irrelevant most sanders supporters believe progress support accelerationist shitheels left whatever wanna 
the point sanders drops biden focus campaign entirely trump something can't he's still attacked left it'd also probably mean sanders' surrogates would stop slinging mud part say david sirota 
biden isnt offering anything bernie voters want yes 
holds gun democratic party trump elected bernie get nomination i'll fuckin' do it 
biden already voluntarily put sanders' free college plan platform extended olive branch sanders immediately take piss debate think interested actual plans going anymore dragging mud much possible 
don't forget free refills it criminal to make pay refill drank fill and want bring drinking vessel considered also or charge anything uncommunist mean unconstitutional

politics like shocking bernie comes back and wins champaign county by huge margin of 
he outperformed polls got vote il i'm surprised disappointed though real effect ultimate result 
no one actually drops suspend campaign 
if register ballot later suspend campaign name removed that plus mail votes early voters uninformed whatever leads lots 
lot people suspend campaign i'd assume different technically ending so guess name still might ballot case 
yeah weird delaney swalwell would still 
recent relative florida cutoff december 
really think harm good they went idealists ideologues 
you're right believe actually independents

down suburbs philly hostility towards bernie demographics 
believe bloomberg completely understands zero chance winning nomination thinks he's fight sanders trump maybe says i'm irritating prick goddamn richer shit going best thing dough kick bernie ass or something like

oh wow opposite got lot li pete biden next best thing 
biden counties mi ms mo 
that pretty incredible places like illinois georgia florida buzz saw still contested 
it's wonder trump attempted bribe extort ukraine dirt joe win counties like loved crow many 
but thought one excited joe that's arrr pol saying lol 
while feels good see results remember trump also got almost votes michigan uncontested primary we may increased turnout consolidated around biden republicans engaged and wrapped closely this going knock drag fight november get complacent need celebrate win prepare battle edit had brain 
oh god michigander happy washtenaw county went biden personal experience felt like bernie hellhole since university michigan campus 
that still legitimately absurd it shows strong collation matter berners say inner city dominance true inner cities suburbs poc white people working class college educated 
mcconnell followers senate knew correctly biden one fear they calculated incorrectly pay price forgot put we time body go traitors 
he win last night cleaned biden strong coalition black voters older across board white suburban women often lean republican broad appeal working class well this winning november electoral college senate 
my county mo one first call biden live majority minority district vote guarantee win but anyways let go joe 
yup hopefully ppl still vote next tuesday though 
any word washington last time chance look practically deadlocked like vote 
did even campaign office states 
boys girls time get joementum full head steam gotta win hearts minds enthusiastic let's go 
what policies joe biden support edit downvote reply passionate 
biden massive lead florida that's going put bs least delegates behind https thehill com homenews campaign poll biden widens sanders florida 
voting joe illinois next week 
atlanta full white hipsters gross hair rich parents might slant towards bernie safe say counties ga go biden 
someone tried convince trump afraid sanders biden taking choice easiest take uh huh is attacking expressing sympathy bernie 
biden rare tons support african american rural white voters 
regardless political stance would pretty ironic biden beat trump general election impeachment smearing obviously aimed all throughout thing could think much hillary's emails ingrained gop voters this time around biden's son ukraine its already mostly done anyways 
nobody unified behind one candidate big media push people it's things true false depending time 
we may increased turnout consolidated around trump uh think misspoke 
this going knock drag fight november we get complacent yeah one side maybe 
that's people ignoring fact percent youth going biden bernie advantage huge 
incredibly surprised washtenaw went biden happy but 
favorite comment last night something effect the establishment rigged primary black elderly voters they told biden choice as can't think 
makes sense though mcconnel politicians trump fake populist fearing real also makes you argue well placed fear stupidity tape private conversations saying feared bernie hammer trade deal support let's argument come better prepared feign ignorance 
wisconsin supreme court election april th trying get walker appointee we hoping contested primary would drive turnout hopefully people still come vote 
nate silver predicted biden win morning so there's 
he supports expanding obamacare provide publi option tax incentives switch electric vehicles solar energy potentially carbon getting deficit increased taxes wealthy americans wants solve things big government there major positions ask curious policies idk people downvoting lmao 
sorry downvotes it's question asked huge amount sub latley people giving quality responses think getting tired repeat would definitely suggest looking around thought threads joe's website but support climate plan post highschool education healthcare plans i'm lazy entire speech lol 
well also wants contribute division party knows use twitter harp bernie wronged supporters likely see get riled 
not sanders supporters warren stans she'll debate trump stage also take dna test discretion 
he's rebuilding bill clinton coalition 
even people saying biden generate much enthusiasm general sanders would 
think dems unified bridge sell 
at least michigan that's really close true https twitter com pklinkne status it looks different places demographics probably look pretty florida 
as young person know exactly zero people interested biden sanders 
for hemming hawing online kids vote 
the media shit's bernie you can't deny not mention look moderate candidates randomly dropping super tuesday warren stayed race 
if wins washington might well it getting harder bs 
no worries asking although bernie supporter given looking like probable candidate want view lens bit 
it first joe biden thread saw today figured looking around 
nope he's courting disenfranchised sanders supporters like 
warren probably would beat trump debate 
malarkey detected bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subreddit message compose joebiden questions concerns 
depends define enthusiasm crowds bernie gather huge he's wildly popular but smaller pond vs default support biden there biden hype way get work attitude far tell 
hmm fair point like ny times exit polls better but yeah shows percent biden jumps group michigan https www nytimes com interactive us elections michigan primary html missouri different numbers little higher 
idk could depend live i'm know couple biden people could see post college maybe youths 
fair that seems liberal pocket michigan lots democrats including moms family classic union workers blue collar folks 
it next week brutal bernie decide press his favorable states behind us 
can't imagine getting downvotes most us happy conversations for obama administration fit conception good literally progressive agenda sitting president think biden could carry torch he'd reach parts party effort unite fox news many people scared kind 'socialism' bernie presidency would get obstructed right wing politicians strive use fear anger tactics order manipulate bernie's messages however lot folks realized evil terrorist wingers made might open hearing relatively ideas came he's already ended pretty approval ratings 
well i'm going give details lol since see completely asking good faith for honestly think climate plan pretty zero emissions goal rejoining paris accord day office trillions towards research nuclear methods possible carbon tax he wants work congress set specific metric year hit march people given flack seems normal his healthcare public option it automatically enroll premium free certain income im sure much stepping stone many countries getting universal also smaller nice like linking drug prices overseas so sell drugs france cheap can't run us and rid surprise billing making emergency hospital visits bill network er like pick provider get lastly education quick disclaimer college mass debt forgiveness number reasons could effect but agree needs brought control ridiculous right joe's community cuts everyone tuition half paying first two years calling loan repayment percent forgiven payment that fair makes buried repayments 
guess he'll make lot progress dividing us many bernie supporters vote biden without question many even small amount selfish enough spite trump sway election there probably one state 
no question it would bloomberg steroids 
warren would turn debate snuff film 
hillary beat trump many debates didn really matter 
yeah one poll vary region wealth race etc they're recalcitrant bernie bros sure biden work win general 
florida alone likely landslide biden that hammers last nails despite chance nomination bernie probably stay race anyway it's 
like education plan lot glad willing work hard climate change issue still skeptical said would veto think people support polls wish talk cutting defense spending really want president war also taking care he nominee thank kind responses realizing stronger together even agree every policy 
he's brilliant debater debate he throws shit if weakness repeat people think true it's clinton lost debates 
ignore title watch https youtu librnyjmz despise trump underestimated particularly given ample material hit biden also polls predict clinton victory 
thanks correcting think stat repeating heard st results might one but need look closer next time 
what states swayed disaffected bernie voters would love hear heard theory possibility never saw anything indicated actually happened 
say underestimate trump said bad debating and polls pretty accurate national polling predicted clinton would ahead popular vote several points there issues state level nothing ordinary what sync reality punditry 
https www npr org sanders primary voters ended supporting trump survey finds 
fair enough guess would see nuance trump bad debating debates his ability reframe manoeuvre bludgeon 'impressive' after seeing bush middle east going pretty hitting iraq china son https www theatlantic com international archive totally normal joe bidens works ukrainian energy company 
interesting but says primary bernie voters voted trump also republican clinton so there's definitely play very interesting many sanders believe white people advantages it would make sense supporters mix want better country think system stacked lies speaks latter 
his ability reframe manoeuvre bludgeon 'impressive' well agree and neither majority people watched debate hillary clinton polling took pretty substantial hit debates sure fans like but matter 
i'm hard bernie supporter damn community surrounding suck happy see civil kind well done super tuesday 
thanks and regardless support always welcome sub 
any time hear civil folks amongst sanders peeps actually vocally disapprove venom really pleased 
in end want beat trump

the sander's community also filled foreign trolls instigating hatred divisiveness fool shame fool twice us 
that join cause we uniting country bernie part also believe people foreign countries maybe even working boiler rooms posing everyday american reddit users instigate divisiveness party fool shame fool twice us 
feel like aren exhausted could joes campaign slogan moving forward the hostility end 
how convince bernie busters get board genuine question trouble friends 
in brief bernie bust phase convention got month nevada debate question rubbed wrong way deleted lot recent posts reddit times let rationality take back voting state april primary agree platform want affordable healthcare crawl broken glass kicking screaming vote joe biden november last night clear going nominee hope gets majority see contested know guys like pete great honest say declaring victory iowa nobody knew still rubs as warren think anymore feel opinion klomentum fuck bloomberg good but damned something prevent fucking clown getting elected even fully nominated also bend knee bullshit really pisses besides need place talk election banned politics since making lame joke passing motion punch mitch mcconnell face apparently advocating political violence 
biden supporters actually comprehend others different perspectives may support candidates that's base broadest diverse the thing i'm reading reddit sanders bewildered everyone think like but understand appeal they feel results likely achieved way all welcome train even he's top choice 
sanders supporter nice person wish son could health insurance plan vote blue matter tho 
bernie supporter vote blue matter come november beating trump important goal 
yes need dogs pulling together pack end even wilder scarier ones welcome include everyone must beat trump 
bernie supporter well came checking biden sub see community like sander die hard supporters political man blind say though energy admirable love passion resolve that mean due respect inspires enthusiasm 
last night busy plotting demise warren vote bernie priorities 
thank and want give credit due bernie campaign excellent latino outreach with bernie's support tx az go blue november 
we need reminded loudest voices behind candidate representative everyone thanks 
thanks kind words if time ever comes welcome 
i'm pete biden supporter thanks posting yes toxicity one main reasons support bernie welcome hope stay regardless 
sandersforpresident ok wayofthebern quite toxic tho 
as recipient enough rat emojis fill zoo can't disagree point 
hang keeping joy top priorities great shield negativity not sanders fan pete guy good luck supporter 
bernie sanders supporter i've seen lot petty nonsense hate bernie's supporters love encouragement browsing say true biden's bash someone support different candidate i'll said sub trump one winning right we're other's throats exploiting shit 
like bernie's character vision but omg supporters seem believe man split ocean hard enough just keep base he's got promise this something joe stress no malarkey politically viable policy 
sanders nice enough guy base cuckoo 
probs cuz like people sub lol 
careful guys you'll get banned 
hard sanders supporter well like lurking subs expose views goddammit amount supporters brigading warren sub makes face palm 
it majority honestly loud minority sucks ass hate fact often dismissed part radical movement dickheads decided assholes others they get convincing people 
og bernie supporter mean like sandersforpresident posts month i'm sad community become while huge actually really want run warren looked going time 
thought post buttigieg's comm chief lis smith yesterday interesting apparently also sanders voter never biden https www twitter com lis smith status 
thought they constantly act like assholes get surprised they're called my favorite part say the whole system rigged go vote of course candidate want going lose so many bernie's key demographic seems they'd rather armchair voters reddit real active way see bernie joe things least similar joe's plans make slower which bad change takes time we've seen drastic change countries around world throughout history and really senate house would support we working together 
but also said sanders support based emotion first place someone tell contempt poor disgusting supporting buttigieg all major candidates great ideas would help people country one according it like even take minutes read policy positions listened politics told 
agree think lot bernie's appeal among supporters emotional you see rallies he inspired candidate field authentic cares working class anyone else imo but i'll set aside feelings vote biden fall for supreme court nothing like pretty much always 
if candidate's supporters reason support spend way much time internet i've got sub blocked still voted sanders 
it really they passionate malignant 
that seen brit interested american politics lot sanders supporters toxic reddit when see biden comment support generally get voted oblivion 
wish true insisting infiltrators giving sanders bad reputation really dismissive experiences 
this sort thinking many can't join bernie camp there things absolutes life arguing russian bots impossible 
that marshall joe rogan dog the werewolf statue podcast studio probably sees every day used 
i've seen quite like will nuke america with four more years of trump if it means bringing the social climate for bernie one always feels dramatic two resoundingly asinine idea wonder many bernie bros surprised things go way 
think still vote bernie primary biden definitely earned respect would voted blue anyway country good hands 
here's put year number let's say moderate candidates progressives regressives see obama trump bernie biden based vote while would us remain busting cause win brings this means next candidate require get back track rather in summation voting stay also keep going make easier unite progress of course model perfect i'm speaking perspective supporter friends 
imo reason pete able confidently declare victory iowa due strength organization campaign internal numbers reliable definitely see looks like cockiness etc backed said hard data large presence effort this dropped he saw path close left race his demonstrated best option drop 
fyi comment hidden tho doesnt seem negative upvotes 
welcome know i'm team pete biden inspire support unite country defeat trump 
seemed like plotting demise dnc bernie 
he robbed voted primary damn problem alienates party moves right 
sanders fanboys absolutely toxic zero seconds later shillary dnc robbed bernie 
assume username already gotten banned sandersforpresident 
get man easy expectations high naive i'm sure sanders people's interest heart sceptical could actually pull ideas even beats trump you see american politicians fair citizens keen anything labeled socialism best bernie's policies put reality would probably heavily watered also wery wrong that's opinion outsider's one 
understand like policies think anyone care supporting broader picture where bernie loses ability unite people followers everyone the country already completely divided trump's administration if stuggling left going get republicans side he's office medicare sounds great remains pass congress 
why trying stir things stand also pay please stop alienating voters 
also think offline online thing know lot fantastic sanders supporters irl however people even see sports teams kids stan pop stars tend way harsher would real life it sort weird hive mind brutal becomes encouraged also nature twitter encourages elevating loudest voices room majority 
well castro lover felled cheeseburger going beat trump 
she needs top shelf position campaign yesterday assuming wants one ditto anyone else excellent warren pete comm social media teams they best class imo 
what candidate constantly talking movement us if sizable chunk vicious spreading misinformation disinformation online problem leadership good people able steer right direction 
the supporters arent reason im sanders policies going shaft 
candidate movement reflective leadership bernie already first choice way supporters treat people cemented belief bad america and case get abuse strangers internet got friends people known half life members bridal party shared meals laughs memories calling shill coward condescending idiotic secret conservative there better ways accomplish progressive agenda 
to fair campaign staff bad 
so white supremacists rallying around trump kind signal rather spending much time internet 
think people discount random posters internet especially knowing russia running psy ops problem perspective lot campaign surrogates come nasty frequently dishonest speech last night helping idea starts top 
i've got couple death threats say otherwise never maga 
really in pete subreddit among things called cock loving homo lover told choke dick hope die this user posts daily and even gay was passionately supporting political candidate happens 
do examples saved i've seen rude people politics thats mostly bots astroturf 
there surprising amounts bots twitter the root pretty good piece russians pretending black activists fb i'm always surprised people downplay russian interference there's enough proof years know big role could tiny long run definitely happened 
this ok attaching kind universal scoring system reflect diversity views electorate lot folks biden sanders perhaps even negative want taxes raised socialist like purity tests division the 'status quo joe' unfair doubt sincerity then pro biden subreddit course i'll defend candidacy policies many feel superior outlined 
it also win regardless actual delegates campaign would theoretically shown legitimate option always issue 
so denying collusion head dnc hillary 
suppppper banned think reddit might profiting donations raise bernie how would prove though know 
add worth voters take time learn candidates ideas policies start biden website go 
going say thing know ton bernie supporters real life they're lovely

part reason need biden win pete gets job transform juggernaut presidential candidate he became star primary make president whether vp cabinet position said role administration this needs happen 
wonder pete amy gonna vp 
hope flip senate seat indiana also thinking state he fluent six seven languages taught norwegian could read books served military sure got quite international understanding

think un ambassador might better sos 
he also sits board foreign policy think tank on top job navy intelligence officer tasked disrupting financial support terrorists deep understanding whole issue 
my comment nothing gay support like pete better younger happy see biden well super tuesday voting florida 
part young left bernie bros most friends went journey sans pete every person volunteered bernie campaign yang back this article spot https www politico com news sanders andrew yang gang

omg stand kamala she horrible attitude pete would great choice think better senate first president run later 
you tell do care spontaneous sincere thing rather something calculated manipulative if felt moved moment think best dwell things enjoy 
also know would want secretary treasury instead senator 
you poor guys must vertigo wherever land safely 
know makes think biden speak threat automation poses in fact he's written topic https www bidenschool udel edu bideninstitute research policy biden institute blog let choose future that puts work first bidenforum org plan put work workers first fab ba just come favor ubi mean understand 
news friend sensors programming essentially ai 
understand see say lis says big week coming 
so think dwell enjoy trying upset 
well imagine warren wished geithner's power butting heads obama administration said would strange give political position favor bueaucratic one 
yes understood fully well saying he'll train miners coders 
fair think managing sewer overflow really people concerned ai one way another mean 
think buzzword looking iot internet things it kind goes hand ai though since provides new data sources implement use cases line 
think amy would good she seems like average mom people could connect might choice we find 
yeah women always vote pete could really bring young moderate voters 
sounds like thought plan let cut welfare give everyone check 
fair enough think point experience and say loud he's probably friends tech people like zuck inform much better septuagenarians 
sounds like someone research candidates' policies 
no looked yang's ubi proposal it cut welfare that's bad 
yang want force people programs yang's vision leave place recipients decide opt dividend per month initial amount full automation yet occurred personal opinion mo start the increased occurs including factors may increase unemployment like outsourced jobs competition due bigger population when happens recipient stay welfare getting benefit let's say cola adjustments people remain longer feasible once ubi far surpass meager benefits humans given subsist everyone opt policy rich middle class poor average payout social workers looking bed dictating foods eat most choose freedom 
florida poll shows biden staggering point lead sanders 
the poll also biden ahead hispanics percent breaking run success sanders states 
see sanders want stay another week suffer round humiliating defeats aside florida biden leads arizona illinois ohio cannot find data it's going rough night bernie 
year old voted biden florida last week first time voting one things made go we're seeing primary far electable sanders doa 
look polls arizona mar biden sanders florida illinois ohio jan dates conducted obvious going get murdered real hard why bernie want drop probably wants debate final hurrah sunday but dropping means he's head high continuing take money supporters fuel delusion nominee unlike andrew yang saw writing wall dropped character continue knew win this forever bite movement https projects fivethirtyeight com arizona florida illinois ohio 
if wins big bernie drop he's getting trounced point much worst 
sanders supporters refuse admit problem reaching minority voters done nothing fix this losing 
to paraphrase great dennis miller sanders making mcgovern look like william conquerer 
it's time unite party focus getting trump hell office novemer 
it's gonna point lead trump soon all old republicans serious risk dying least realizing business leading america 
people underestimate much cuban american hate castro 
in days hour glass these days bernies lives 
hmmmm would thought praising cuban dictator result 
bernie knew super tuesday loss but wants stay race spread socialism lite agenda he's trying drag biden left like hillary 
truly think primary race barring thing extraordinary god forbid anything interferes bernie days platform issues debate bow gracefully if prediction correct go respect 
wish primary saturday may time vote but looks like need 
we can't presidential candidate lost cause florida bernie chose impressing radical fringe competing one largest states america 
if polls elections hillary clinton would president right we yet get vote 
know people keep mentioning cubans florida moderate overall including democrats they hated sanders hate hillary primary biden win big though believe mail ballots lots bloomberg yes thats right stayed may we like month think factor take votes south florida 
i'm concerned virus effect turnout we many older people might feel comfortable voting and far i've heard rescheduling like louisiana plan pop early tuesday make sure sanitize 
sanders never understand hispanics monolithic mexican americans southwest different cuban miami night day 
too bad nobody sanders camp listened andrew gillum offered free advice https twitter com davidaxelrod status 
thats big oof bernie gets hit bad az dropped yesterday 
tell little ohio since home state growing still family incredibly purple irrespective massive gerrymandering happened democrats revolution let's burn type they're pragmatic likely former eisenhower like republicans but today's republican party batshit insane they've democrats it's also hillary county so year biden country 
he already two consecutive weeks rough nights lost minnesota massachusetts washington states favored thumped michigan state gave campaign boost from excercise masochism it's decide enough 
i'm bernie guy expecting might drop monday coronavirus turning he gave swan song yesterday much clear us supporters drank kool aid he's setting joe court base debates sunday literally blue print 
the corn vote biden guarantee 
it's going rough night bernie but great us 
how fuck data ohio the most important state electoral wise 
great job man doesn't pain media likes say bernie popular youth yet past two super tuesdays came vote hardly lol joked michigander friend biden yang supporter brag supporters attend rallies ain't voting lol 
biden also appeal working class minorities 
maybe think try praise fidel's awesome beard cool green uniform 
his position aipac probably help jewish retirees 
it sure help vote absentee florida voted bernie team biden awhile though say never appeal anyone certain subreddits claim otherwise willfully ignorant polls going back months show either bloomberg surprised 
you know fine bernie going want spread message debate it one week really think anything gives biden chance speak american people but numbers like wish progressive media would stop feeding fight end win narrative sit echo chamber send hundreds dollars belief actual mean money everything young spending much amounts statistically zero winning makes feel little bad 
some deserve honest one dude donated credit card right super tuesday shocked hell 
they're used belittling pete supporters low black support forgot well 
yeah wtf happened miller used good snl 
credit credit due that's excellent comparison 
the worst thing literacy program part cubas brainwashing indoctrination programs its like praising maos education camps taught people read 
not cubans south americans castro exported marxist revolution latin american countries it goes way beyond south florida 
and make weaker candidate general like hillary bernie sanders made donald trump president 
he missed gracefully window already 
this we and south florida cuban america absolutely surprise as latina community tell large number us families fled socialist countries cuba venezuela nicaragua etc family forced flee country socialist revolutionaries scare hell many 
exactly hundreds possibly thousands cuban refugees died attempting flee cuba can imagine traveling make shift raft miles sea their situation must dire 
if big win coming state like ny could see staying wipes states next week support going evaporate april th far long drag dead race 
he made speech wa switched 
see staying till tuesday he chance debate hope upset if stays longer wednesday hurting biden think losing massively swing states send clear message bernie's base lose primaries rigged people like 
republican around knew bush lying iraq think gop gotten worse since know talking 
you summarized ohio pretty well part see lot fanatical trump supporters suspect people tired shit they also want bernie think wants impossible much reach get hopes blue year shitty going gotta something look forward 
hope right sounds opposite expectations 
isnt florida important electoral state we biggest ec votes alk battlegrounds 
it's important are still living 
see flair initially pete supporter excited vote many reasons biden presumptive nominee might even considering primary could decided time state votes but always struck one genuine compassionate politicians also person never fallen pie sky fantasy plans data driven sanders supporters insult going depth work denmark really makes wanna 
yeah tbh experience somewhat conservative area know young people influence parents think age actually support sanders say cause several like memes probably vote till general granted also biden obama he's vp aside pence remember 
im florida voting biden think bernie fraud selling lie desperate scared young people 
your comment auto collapsed new reddit anti brigading program tells bros think eh 
the thing frustrates gives sanders crowd another week attack nominee create division instead pivoting general 
yea especially young people spending much delusion need save damn coronavirus lol damnit bernie 
wow fucking bern foon buffoon that dude fucked additional savings needed withstand covid's impact life lol 
just interject there's reason opposed you omit portion he's supporter dream bill also alone league united latin american citizens supported decision https www latinorebels com bernie sanders voted immigration reform right exploitation immigrant workers sounds pretty bad 
i'm black reference almost get white savior complex bernies supporters act like us blacks know better supporting bernie that alone makes jump biden train even 
scared xenophobic asshole embraced fox news crowd 
seen article last weeks argued cuban literacy already estimated pre castro government propaganda number would much like proven right wrong 
not true bowing right michigan would abrupt like said lets see behaves debate tuesday night goes happens wednesday if hard core attack mode change opinion 
nevermind amount puerto ricans moved mainland debacle maria 
very true mean imply south florida latinos cuban seem greatest influence miami melting pot many central american nations represented 
hey relevant conversation opinion latinx 
worked gitmo processing refugees citizenship asylum it heartbreaking 
https www cnn com world russia ghana troll farms ward index html 
the last poll ny biden winning think wall street ny bernie wants take dont he'll well 
support going evaporate his seemed surprisingly robust face crushing odds 
im going give benefit doubt the debate could good way set joe base 
there multiple polls florida none ohio 
it still they literally anounced obamas win ohio 
use term fraud pure delusional thinking lol yea campaign movement knows seducing youth free college tuition rest country healthcare gets really educated people even supposedly degrees fall vote he preys vulnerable desperate get rid debt insecurities began proposing college stuff without knowing much costs finally got calculate wound insane trillions dollars years that shit ain't going passed congress dems would pass and wants tax wealthy including middle class upwards super amount wealth purely knew evade taxes fuck supporters think know run away increases either also funny thing speaking yang supporter bernie bros straight called conman grifter making ubi proposal giving every adult american month us yanggang morons believing yet bet eye offered promises but unlike math fund pragmatically via vat system similar europeans ongoing coronavirus update seems needed ever stimulate economy you like former top obama economics advisor jason furman endorsing ironically aoc trojan horse tweeted hours ago endorsement goes show punk politicians idea all talk fluff yet substance whereas biden there's form consistency 
it also stops heavy hitters like obama clintons remaining neutral endorsing campaigning joe 
there non zero chance plenty sanders supporter real trolls keep attacking nominee well bernie drops 
actually felt gay man others community the lgbtq subs skew pretty young there's lot bernie bros act like want rights taken away i'm voting then course bring video biden saying support marriage yeah remember watched debate live and turned around voted campaign understand politics works if get elected matter supported done it's shame bernie's gone negative it really sets tone supporters 
it move try capture market potential fans comic miller well comedians contrarian libertarian heart made lot sense see got now he's appeared fox many times liberals give light day anymore stuck of course act suffered appeal target audience way larry cable guy 
check interview npr https www npr org examining bernie sanders comments literacy castro era cuba the rate prior castro wanted but used program marxist ideology indoctrination 
yes true he chance the people spoken and supporters hoping coronavirus keeps old voters florida speaking tuesday meanwhile ohio state looking poll workers work cover coming polls numbers would way lower sanders admitted plainly true so that's happening in middle pandemic average worker president flailing he'll running biden not bernie that's done there's debate accepted goes well comes like things but trips inch gives answer fox news use hurts chances november against trump because can't accept plain truth lost 
yes lot puerto ricans well different issues south americans trump didnt even know us citizens 
there lot puerto ricans florida even maria 
just remember south florida miami theres also broward palm monroe counties cubans influential get cities dade demos shift know didnt mean imply latinos cuban want point oit damaging socialist thing many americans problems socialists socialisim hard sell venezuelan couple owns bakery go colombian neighbors even american countries arent like colombia communist guerilla groups farc and castro remarks helping bernie read article said biden tailoring latino outreach community going use approach texas california thought treating caribbean south americans mexicans work well we different issues every latino cares mexicans i'm ashamed republicans actually support border wall deportations they got citizenship dont care anyone else it infuriates 
dont know spanish speaking latino uses it doesnt make sense spanish gendered language want english gender neutral term use latin need the people ive ever heard whites

god preview presidency able sleep at night 
for first time years i'm reminded competent intelligent president sounds like confronting grave national emergency bluntly honestly openly bold plans rise occasion if joe white house right edit hillary we'd much better she'd 
biden vaccine available free charge 
good quote public health professionals must ones making public decisions 
this real sane leadership looks like the problem whole lot damage done able step help 
the only one acting like leader 
biden speaking acting like true president can skip january already 
greg sargent https twitter com theplumlinegs status absolutely crucial joe biden called reliable daily updates testing numbers how right 
just love says folks here's bottom line 
biden killing imo so much better last night's snort fest trump looked annoyed virus personally affecting economy election 
joe biden has dementia seriously fuck anyone hear speech think man president 
crazy hear someone speak like president years 
biden we need bold compassionate smart leadership 
jennifer rubin https twitter com jrubinblogger status the white house humiliated done thing biden describes they utter failures americans die result 
like acts president actually gets he's ready lead 
bakari sellers https twitter com status this biden speech good presidential the contrast stark 
can elect mr biden swear 
this president looks like addresses nation he reassuring comfortable confronting truth facts even bad news trump shut great that speech virus 
biden the trump administration's failure testing colossal 
this legitimately like looking alternate timeline president happening timelines beau die https np reddit com democratsfordiversity comments fhczaj dfd discussion thread march fkbl 
for first time life felt reassured bolstered politician 
god missed someone sounding presidential actually give damn 
joe showing right true leadership decision making ability lead nation 
i'm going lie im actually getting emotional comforting hearing sane laeder 
proud say today cast vote joe biden florida primary 
it spectacular moment joe great comprehensive plan wish much could actually talked america months wait we need 
it's bloody hilarious biden basically saying i'll take president right guys 
joe biden we lead science 
november can't come soon enough we need serious leadership clowns 
like he's calling covid sounding professional 
see looks around speaking doesnt need prompter like trump 
i'm watching great speech far coming team pete joe make calm speaks growing i'll happily vote november after last night's address many cancellations postponements etc today least joe's bit relief this president need white house 
i'm hoping explicitly calls elizabeth warren's early work plans corona candidate senator she pushing thinking issues like containing prisons frankly many folks ignoring and think best message democrats going forward we're party competence pull together generate ideas 
wow effective speech already taking charge acting like president need right 
joe sounds like leader ready day november can't come fast enough 
nearly cried watching yearning past years particularly leadership like 
lead science fucking makes want cry trump enabled worst us world biden adult needs wh this leader it's like already president 
some good graphs virus https www vox com future perfect coronavirus covid charts 
will also cnn somebody prefers tv broadcast 
looks like microphone covid wish they'd done dry runs little earlier 
they're replacing one mics appears body mic duct tape 
market instantly hahahahah fuck you trump 
the moment senate republicans blocked sick leave bill democrats television immediately shout mountaintops mitch mcconnell and his republicans want you to die yeah unrealistic never say people need get drilled heads 
imagine president wanting lead science confront public health crisis advice experts i'm honestly getting flashbacks financial both happened election year surprise shocks economy at least involve people dying much blame placed current time and candidates show would handle situation in fact obama responded lehmann brothers crash remaining calm consulting one things cited others voting it's reassuring demeanor we've missing 
this bernie path joe's speech going everywhere news he's already covered presumptive nominee more free media biden presidential thump type coverage could get debate audience provide made tv moment would otherwise desperately need overcome point deficit hope right thing drops wednesday needs take consideration asking loyal supporters money support candidacy unwise say least 
is anyone else trouble youtube version 
did start yet campaign feed youtube still coming soon stream 
man cut live feed the whole world need hear av guy freaking 
biden calm collective speech solutions reassuring people time reminds obamas demeanor imagine bernie fellow americans testing free right fuck billionaires guy joke 
love joe fucking hell wrong people live stream turned off you politics learn hot mic this another stupid thing republicans blast heels great speech tuesday 
last minute mic checks done 
jfc almost forgotten real president sounds like 
this joe offer moment like one said exactly america needed hear trump could he honest treated us adults let know we're together every citizen must stand united front combat threat families communities it mandatory watch trumps response bidens crisis anyone allowed cast ballot people need reminded real leadership how president responds feels last years fever dream want functional government never life imagined important taken away 
is joe purposely slowing speech stutter less less gaffes sounds emotionless 
and know people joe taps manage things directly experts professionals confidence 
maybe eye twitch check phone stop 
the first three words my fellow americans realize we've desperately missing 
understand vaccine charged what would point 
the reparations going large hey united states 
if election tomorrow bet joe would win judging lead national polls sucks endure almost whole year misinformation campaigns 
i'm bernie supporter whole joe biden dementia thing disgrace it hold slightest scrutiny it's quick clips right doctored videos absolutely appalling sub twitter heads kept pushing narrative watch unedited figure desperate bullshit 
someone else pointed indirectly helps biden by setting bar low soon hear speak anyone brain quickly realize bs narrative 
hilariously attacking using teleprompter which exactly republicans obama exactly 
yeah joe sounded good this put rumors dementia rest 
lot things said biden's speech pretty ableist 
serious leadership might good campaign motto 
i'm glad see afraid it'll late 
the failure even make sense logistically trump administration literally two months warning plan we're trouble testing are kidding 
same biden awesome side bonus made utter fool trump 
who would thought global pandemic require science 
he keeps hitting spots left right reads ahead talking trouble finding place lose wing sound like teenager forced read apology 
you like trump says cuuuronaahh uh sighs eye russs 
think actually unlike trump knows use prompter can't tell using one 
good catch also noticed actually knows constitution 
cory booker the answer hatred division reignite spirit common purpose joe biden win show there's unites us divides he restore honor oval office tackle pressing challenges that proud endorse 
we vegans dairy free ice cream want 
so former candidates goes biden pete amy harris delaney patrick booker beto bloomberg ryan bernie williamson de blasio yikes 
this nice sight see booker biden voter 
booker positive dude another great addition team 
as fan alliteration biden booker ring 
can agree many awesome vp candidates who could bernie possibly run isolate base besides warren capitalist 
man love cory booker really surprised campaign catch in crowded talented field may damn struggled hard especially keeping real 
both pete booker endorsing biden compassion positivity ability bring unity the coalition continues grow 
gotta love cory it's worth taking look baby bonds proposal fight wealth inequality give everyone fairer start https www vox com policy politics cory booker baby bonds yes address based positivity real research rather demonizing fraction company hoping solve things another great fit team biden 
as cory supporter dropped great 
cory ok i'm buying shirt 
that's senator cory second choice dropped i'm looking forward voting november 
cory second choice vp behind amy biden booker also sounds cool 
cory booker first choice still campaign i've donated he preached message radical love loving opponent hardest thing right bridge gap that's shown america within across party lines for unity candidate values something constantly reminded pete's bidens he's compelling speaker think huge help trail happier seen endorsement morning 
yesssssss love pete totally happy cory vp 
thank corey i'll never quite understand campaign took way 
mods get cory joe flair 
this type content need right 
yeah go joe really like booker well 
thank cory booker unity need defeat trump 
forgot bloomberg lol also amy klob person 
why would de blasio endorse bernie anyway is one thing share common else likes 
how could forget bernie biggest endorsement yet beto former college bandmate 
you forgot gravel bernie though teenage handlers endorsed tulsi decide 
none matters wayne messam endorsement comes 
seriously bernie could even get warren 
seth moulton endorsed biden mike gravel co sanders gabbard 
tulso remains imp fox news one 
pete guy able stay race longer cory would made decision difficult he's good us 
if we're going male vp booker 
biden bernie buttigeig bloomberg lot election cycle 
think pete would best option biased amy experience hill could also invaluable making sure deals got done 
we gay president vegan unfortunately quite ready one 
kind hoping pete man cory would great choice 
think many talented qualified candidates hard stand biden lot name recognition alone top long solid political career 
thrilled couple things senate career damn ever miss debates dropped 
feel like another candidate lost moderate lane pete 
that one things really loved cycle sheer amount research candidates put proposals instead waving arms yelling revolution got nerdy hard pete every time saw copious footnoting 
want senators reps stay put 
his vp needs black woman demings abrams we also need reps blue states pick color swing state like 
he also vegan right love booker 
reminds politician version chris traeger parks rec lol 
or booker biden that alliteration thooo 
would love hope least serious consideration 
joementum continues this build winning coalition 
there male equivalent hillary clinton female trump that sounds like type check box stuff leads saying michael bloomberg devil ignoring people's fallibility extension failing see strengths this candidate incumbent everybody knows well it's new ballgame he advantage come november may also strong economy aiding reflection chances mean was obama previous biden better lot regions already 
i'm and love well cory feel truly indulged today 
nyc mayors trying hitch wagons populist movements seems like thing 
omg that's huge endorsement the establishment are about to be destroyed yippee 
irony tower come get alt 
hell endorse someone especially michigan coming want either win 
demings joe would probably win ex republicans cause cross appeal meets law order 
biden's vp someone covering weaknesses bring votes black women help much biden already gotten seen strengthening strengths leaving unfortified surefire way getting trump elected someone young fresh still poc like andrew yang would better fit considering diverse following ex berners voters independents previously politically apathetic weakness youth progressive something also achieve nd choice many bernie warren supporters rally general both seem exchange personal phone calls one another every weeks recently early last week however endorsing anyone yet unless adopt ubi policies now skeptical adopting consider days ago harvard economics professor jason furman former top obama economics advisor espoused combat economic effects coronavirus https www wsj com articles case big stimulus so presumably worked together may position convince work things hopefully earn endorsement 
hope decision vp made basis there enough qualified female options gender factor it would nice know first diversity hire 
but thing we believe best chance hold congress supreme court biden win primary life long dem actually works republicans bernie using name blown third party 
that alliteration thooo beto booker biden bernie buttigeig bloomberg bennet bullock bill de blasio i've heard warren goes beth 
if vp needed male i'd definitely want beto close nd 
the first interview saw boldly rolls delicious describing fabric diversity thought guy going somewhere 
he's waiting whether bernie picks vp 
florida kingmaker wayne could tilt election whim single sentence when speaks listens 
maybe want alienate anyone choices either toxic movement movent align much policy platform blame staying

hear when kamala dropped 'kamalaisacop' crowd didnt stand chance get vote biden decent man policies great 
here's i'm currently looking bernie's entire campaign plurality supporters become exclusionary ideas people align purity bernie demands rarely meets that's another issue biden's imperfect joe seem much willing open tent allow spectrum types part that's fucking win election it's going easier push biden left get compromise anything put stop toxicity still belief pete best person running i'll take cooperation combativeness day support ugly inside 
dont think redditors know actively losing votes bernie 
it cult like trump they calling mayor cheat rat face since iowa demand allegiance sanders 
sorry deal supported sanders feel somewhat responsible since helped make bigger ever vote now though joe way 
sorry sanders people horrible everyone they especially bad candidate drops the best thing report move don give air maybe movement suffocate 
i've given reddit politics mean know i'll still post read makes mad pete supporter my second choice klobuchar since non viable dropped plan vote biden there issues different line one candidate that's fine even try argue people voting sanders might chime yes actually support claim i'm as soon say something like though knives accusing racist wanting put brown children cages awful person excuse guess argument mind bernie win therefore anyone primary equivalent someone trump automatically etc bots probably vocal minority it putting thing ever bashed moderate make want go you screw wins nomination guys jerks emotional response rational whoever gets democrat stage but goddamn they're trying turn voters away one trump's tweets afternoon playing rabid bust voter saying staging coup wonder busters realize sound talk 
bernie trump polar opposites politically differences supporters getting harder differentiate both camp takes clue top see angry hate filled conspiracy spewing rhetoric candidate campaign staff surrogates pete yang lots young rarely toxic behavior candidates half bernie's age btw shown maturity decency grace expected leader millions people don't take criticism hypocrisy heart hopefully better win primary ge would back playing bigger role party far future 
im exactly biden reasonable choice klobuchar gone 
i've pete supporter almost since day donated well put money mouth to say biden supporters among nicest supportive people virtually campaigns would understatement choosing joe likely hard either i'm still trying get dropping hurts little god damn pumped feel like endorsements rolling beto amy etc energizing hell biden's campaign rock star performance south carolina 
maybe waste carpal tunnel people say internet toxic sanders supporters sadly affected toxicity personal level friend came lived parents house inobama could make difference pa versus new york city my somehow ok even girl high school seen years stay truly platonic way election ends later starts progressive facebook group gladly join from grew dozen essentially bernie page we get kavanaugh hearings stereotype triggered huge during see post women done ever listening man's opinion matter all men bit frankly stated along lines type mentality fighting decades listen how better dozens calling rapist private messages attempts doxxing threatening calling wife submissive whore must abuse you name and stayed weeks thanked night obama letting change told deserved maybe next time side proceeded harass nearly week i'm woman value eventually block excommunicated that's types experiences i've know others received treatment dislike politician though social media accounts absolutely try feed hysteria but comparison give many encountered trump esque 
the funny thing people harass spam bernie even show vote 
know mean they found better way make run away 
as said https np reddit com neoliberal comments fcdoyv pete buttigieg mulling endorsement joe biden fjaj referring future pete sanders administration supporters go he's convenient right they're like incels oh hi pretty want get dinner friday told person plans fuck ugly hag dare i'd ever you look biden people hey talks good quite experience give decade he'll contender that changes analogy response oh bummer well plan eating coming fridays let know something opens while could see exception commercial dropped nh debate level venom sanders' camp order magnitude higher it's also bad enough sub post that's old buttigieg fce bernie stop trying convert us telling fans bugger 
and they'll new focus lies disinformation name calling be prepared we supported pete rules road rotr followed i'd love continue but put hypocrisy without downvoting pointing like hypocrite https redd dhvphwaiak jpg 
thats sanders supporters they better trump attacking everyone even dares say anything bad but dont worry arrogance also downfall like as race become biden see toxic behavior 
bernie trump polar opposites politically differences supporters getting harder differentiate there's term it mimics horseshoe theory https en wikipedia org wiki horseshoe 
exactly sanders trump left he angry mob following boogeyman blames everything billionaires promising world without real plan accomplish as former yang guy i'll probably go biden agree lot things least seems realistic and think there's chance he'll bring cabinet 
bernie trump polar opposites politically not trade protectionism high skilled immigration they virtually identical 
in hs loved sanders old independent progressive senator vermont what's love caucused deep red state landslide then got closer nomination changed tune bit least turned volume fanaticized followers perhaps desperation started misgivings the last three years seen take part ineffective hyperpartisan senate all great divide keeps widening parties' platforms co digging side him warren anti trump sjws way built obama xenophobic nationalists his colleagues trying drum support disgusting disrespectful unethical cruz rubio graham wtf happened rallying 
me wait see say amy 
think sanders supporters like vocal portion toxic tho feel vote based candidate that chose support biden country needs 
as sanders supporter i've tried repeatedly warn vitriol towards candidates could otherwise end supporters totally self defeating some people spiteful morons 
even though buttigieg supporter whenever saw people attacking stupid shit like always put two cents try shut 
think candidates extreme policies see attracting kinds people sure bernie may democratic socialist trump anti liberal alt right appeal less educated working class folk there reason saw many busters go the major deciding factor berners trumpers social issues overlook policy dislike get sort establishment populist politics looking 
happy cake day fellow former pete person feel way the toxicity unbearable 
well willing vote except bloomberg actual candidates engaged racist anti semitic red scare tactics obama always better dog whistle politics 
same frequent cruelty means support bernie get nomination would seriously hate go joe 
i'm left politically pete sweet spot candidate amongst reasons supported but regarding biden versus bernie common sense trust decent honest person character record back even always agree someone who's consistently done nothing last years somehow think deserve win promised people everything sun 
pete rat face what drug not reddit media for example get debate pundits like give much drive tv ratings least recognize candidates biden well ones consistently showed respect rules moderators and course instead pundit criticize fighting win 
careful russian trolls thread lots anti bernie sentiment trying say biden loses stay home we need unify matter defeat trump 
they care want know wrong owe vote 
pete hooked solid second week march last year time considering sanders saw supporters acted rallies went took forever disavow anything bro well months seen trump two sides coin counterfeit boot studying candidates years comparing promises body language repetitions attacks without use truth mostly helped understand character short order neither warren would get accomplished far confrontational garner support even congressional democrats bloomberg gabbard created reputations remember tulsi declining vote stop frisk poor never considered running glad klobuchar finally light hoped least see super tuesday fare still got california leave trying decide want go state caucus next losing hit lot harder expected 
okay even talk prove anyone internet actually shouldn't first sure primary sources using evidence make kind actual decision shall also perform statistical count bernie supporters insults versus candidates trumpians compare authenticity based two studies juxtaposed identity quantity basically there crazy people everywhere huge platform misinformation subversive use social media regards information without data anecdotal really useful just opinion someone research day offense meant 
supporters toxic sides see sander's different democratic candidates if go sanders reddit site find welcoming remember end need come together defeat trump 
love now is not the time to fight warren drop out and get behind bernie like they're ones threw hissy fit clinton beat refused back 
honestly petty part thinking sanders gets nomination win either trump voted supporters see can't defeat general election though vitriolic stand around shouting things rigged boomers racist assholes whatever complaint 
agreed lieberman's final shank america aca still showed perfect biden knew good enemy great became law even ideal 
edit voted bernie primary me and top priority candidate sanders for lot reasons getting sick awful behavior supporters made look realize many problems 
same was richardson obama then sanders clinton now pete joe it's love baby 
also voted bernie ultimately hillary he following lost majority us this democratic party stands if socialists want revolution start get i'm sick losing time make american's proud saying democrat we need lead addition inclusion i've learned pete supporter last year join side we'll better edit millennial student loan debt 
it's like trump's cousin running democrat party 
you describe feelings better pete supporter since march coming biden also voted bernie 
feel exact way being college tough politically right campus around bernie supporting i've explained i'm biden they've abandoned quest convert 
edit voted bernie primary two days ago can't stand people i'll go back lurking 
kamala frontrunner pete announced missed dropped disagreed policy positions could always count call bullshit needed called 
and even fake sincerity https imgur com ab yx jpg get be careful everyone 
ditto it's wonder sanders well 
any examples point everything see front page thanks running great campaign 
are trying drive folks away supporting biden wins general if tone great way create divisiveness 
trump absolutely stirring pot make things worse what hate seeing anyone wants better country buying 
liked amy tom still would've trouble voting they executive experience although pete's small scale biden's limited vp wish inslee ran least know execute laws foster cooperation committees arbitrate civilians government officials biden pete two presidential candidates last hope 
same i'm yet ready beat drums like see versus elsewhere hope hell guy pete help push needs joe would wise pay attention ease reservations but unity pushed need we time bickering can't contested convention long protracted fight there are only eight months defeat donald trump look quick primary went before know year going do want waste half infighting alright think talked still stinging let's teampeteforjoe 
hey man really sorry happened as bernie supporter know people wrong feel bad represent camp good luck 
it feels like people brainwashed thinking worst 'other side' whether republicans moderate conservative democrats 
holy shit sounds like ex friend joined cult scientology 
looks like rotr https imgur com tbe png 
think vitriolic vocal minority majority sanders pointers sure souring opinion whole lot loud obnoxious 
it's fair make blanket statements sanders supporters there many vocal toxic also even 
far left right hate jews 
came maga yang does joe similar policies 
exactly they incredibly isolationist foreign policy chops cut commander chief 
the far left right lot common middle 
economically fairly far apart politically holy hell closer pair authoritarians long time 
exactly tweeted support biden last night woke morning dozens mentions tweets calling republican they also name checked obama if ever want vote blue matter kind behavior vicious people different views stop

seen thread personally thank god folks pete subreddit said chasten's phone number got doxed yesterday fucking assholes really testing rules road civility right 
you said came pete joe if thought bernie early campaign follower's behavior destroyed inclusive positive agenda ability get done seem far realistic bernie's 
cnn projected joe biden democratic primary florida 
the talking point well florida red state cares it went obama twice imagine back campaign trail joe awesome 
cnn allots delegates biden sanders 
it looks like clean sweep biden bernie needs give already 
can bernie drop it serious public health hazard point 
at sander's hq dang praised castro 
this big one had sanders somehow scored coronavirus we'd long haul think concedes today it made sense keep going debate no 
we're riden biden sanders supporters get board support trump vote democratic candidate books 
what thought old uneducated viters dont vote 
live county https www nytimes com interactive us elections results florida president democrat primary election html action click module elex pgtype interactive region navigation love sumter west orlando bernie losing bloomberg dropped weeks ago 
in sanders lost florida hillary clinton some groups performed well white men independents follow supported nomination quarter slightly voting biden half independent democratic voters that's flip state backed 
don't praise fidel castro next time 
moved florida vote still georgia election voted abrams first floridian proud say joe went early voting sunday 
he's winning every county state one berniedropout 
another major swing state general biden easily 
excellent good job joe outreach it's especially needed right unify democratic party fast want beat trump now voted sanders banned sandersforpresident asking tone attacks win help show people policies far status quo there going lot drag feet mud name call complain don't one be open willing better way ready we unite bring leadership back washington ensure supreme court seats lost biden us get hope former supporters hop aboard soon 
joe can't stopped next trump 
proud state let go joe 
is florida joining every county gang 
now wanna see hit front page 
at point bernie go runner asshole wants cause problems 
heyyyy voted joe first day early voting jacksonville 
called grandma tears begged volunteer primary insisted life long democrat we kicked bernie's ass hope worth at point extending blood hands 
yeah rosario dawson beto's former band mate endorsing 
keep bringing people invite subreddit 
this surprisint sanders wins vermont except biden like dozen states several times many delegates 
is graphic use nfl draft 
keep inviting people join subreddit we need much members 
what reasons people supporting joe bernie assumed election everyone would obviously sanders looks like i've living bubble can't see reason seems gonna happen id love vote that's he's better trump 
fence guys want biden badly 
canada rest world watches people vote person going hold platform promises people actually forget politicians lie get office and succeed backpedaling becomes impossible ignore love humans swear america grandiose social experiment ignorance propaganda greed really hope actual progressives refuse comes presidential election some lessons learned hard way enjoy next half decade choosing lying garbage 
ugh americans never learn maybe terrible educational system uniquely poor healthcare unfathomable protections rich despite inflating prisoner homeless injustice rates true leaders come light trampled weak citizens hedging bets future returns old routine instead continuing deal untrustworthy embarrassing leadership deserve get they bernie change he two steps forward biden one step back granted trump twenty backwards overall progress it starting feel like deadly virus attacks mostly older generations bit karma 
great years no universal healthcare 
just another moderate get us nowhere i'll vote i'm voting years mediocrity 
illinois went biden that's solid blue state michigan leaning swing there really argument my regrets able vote today governor pulled plug last minute early still little unsure bernie request ballot window closed 
biden winning texas florida basically means bernie drop those important states and biden win michigan love bernie's message get head right quit 
cnn projecting insurmountable lead biden sanders' gains wiped away florida 
why would he still take donations hourly employees currently work it kind considerate approach 
it looks like clean sweep biden 
if bs drops rest states move primaries june mail 
clean sweep right surprised keeps winning every state going forward 
say want bernie quitter he's convention he millions vociferous supporters owes sell 
seriously forcing people keep going polls obviously lost cause irresponsible point 
not mention chaos uncertainty states postponing primaries combined virus means rest primary might good turnout could skew results 
he announced speak tonight asshole just drop 
we probably vote november either 
man optimism feels like intention stopping 
maybe who knows guy though what weeks convention endorsed clinton 
reading comment instantly made think james franco meme first time 
there thing independent democratic voter you democrat vote florida primary 
not surprise sure welcome one unexpectedpalpatine 
hope avoid using derogatory language describe sanders intense passionate beliefs often manifests misguided ways definitely causes problems think makes asshole 
she's years old served moderate democrat missouri house representatives 
no democratic primaries less proportional 
bernie talks lot big game says really unrealistic trust candidates like joe warren actually know they're politics while progressive views also think win general election i'm thinking practical based polls results knowledge governments campaigns run second best candidate running president since knows he's much liberal people 
bernie hugely idealistic lot hopes accomplish politically realistically feasible right know joe perfect pragmatic lots political experience think get done give chance 
think sanders passionate idealistic biden wants many things pragmatic realistic understanding lot politically economically feasible right hopefully joe get like public option higher minimum wage least way 
how world reasonable person hope america votes donald trump this election affects countries outside us know insane 
you're part problem unfortunately we'd love join us if feel like progress progressive enough please remember joe much right current administration 
think bernie great ideas dreams passion unfortunately pragmatic enough turn reality even elected president would able accomplish campaigning supporters realize definitely joe perfect bus going place sanders slower higher chance making progress hope nothing else come agree taking one step back still much better twenty 
universal probably next time get trifecta single payer madness pocket expenses outlawing private insurance youll waiting lot longer years one ill vote forever 
did really think bernie going come get universal healthcare right away even somehow got passed congress would take years implement years 
joe hinted last year he's staying one term maybe good time start building bridges instead burning pointing specifically 
thats ok friend glad board general election 
make sure vote june your still counts ballot 
michigan huge win biden that showed best candidate midwest general election 
seriously and encouraging drawn primary point dangerous he zero chance get ideological high horse drop again coming former bernie supporter 
biden adopting alot bernie's policies he even moderate versions bernie wants which part reason getting popular 
yeah can't believe head right if back pedalling piece garbage problem lying way office i'm canada pity people think someone like joe biden going hold platform promises it literally happened alberta conservative voted immediately went profit have clue gonna help 
he also still kill thousands opponent's supporters feigning ongoing primary fight forcing septuagenarian biden voters literally risk lives go polls vote someone already mathematically 
people say bernie effect wealth inequality dead wrong he managed transfer considerable money vulnerable millennial media conglomerates social giants 
not sure win district day 
result declared merely hour this election must rigged 
at cost people needlessly standing line primaries need 
tbf ballots primary though agree needs drop 
it's becoming super clear ego thing same exact strategy dampened enthusiasm turnout actual democratic nominee knew chance so irresponsible 
this year totally different though clinton dws actually bunch shady shit people right mad primary naked fair objective sanders damn thing complain he lost voters want ideas full stop 
there core group sanders supporters committed poisoning political discourse matter no need teabag 
but like kansas change party affiliation day

man endorsement took it obvious waiting til warren dropped though she close edit proof new harris biden spoke yesterday giving space decided move forward endorsing former vp got race aide tells https twitter com deepa shivaram status 
it's good finally kamala's official endorsement now wait see she'll future vp admittedly i'm biased one first choices primary picks joe make think fits criteria needs younger reassure voters concerned pushing young greenhorn potential liability knock wood worst happens she's government game hit ground running president is african american woman tons experience towards reaching firing black woman demographic key winning as addendum choosing mate ensure black vote take granted biggest keys just relying numbers gonna cut hillary unfortunately proved puncher debates confidently hand mike pence ass the problem kamala add much delegate table given california also means dems safely leave senate seat without fear giving republicans overall seems like logical choice 
current former senators endorsed joe three sanders 
fucking politics trash there like different posts jesse jackson endorsing bernie almost post kamala my got deleted instantly 
is campaign number unite we need cory booker 
scroll pages politics sub find you tell great news hard they're trying bury

https medium com kamalaharris im endorsing joe biden president united states her full statement 
so excited see back campaign and az means there's chance i'll get campaigning joe 
if warren endorses hope castro joins know sexy rooting beto vp help latino vote joes struggling bloc far many voted trump it may also make az true battleground 
then needs move wa next three days 
thank you united states attorney general kamala harris love think right choice vp yes might fuel young voters fact remains comes blue state what biden needs someone deliver swing and i'm even sure stacey abrams equally 
i'm sure would great reporter sam stein eugene robinson who cover politics sub take suppression average headlines last checked around one stories featuring biden news they acting like bernie dominates percent coverage rest corona virus 
there literally dozen posts politics jesse jackson endorsing sanders his supporters happy bernie finally black friend 
doesn look like biden getting coverage today coronavirus cnn msnbc 
https en wikipedia org wiki kamala wrestler 
this beautiful my biden harris ticket dream lives 
bit surprising considering many hives moved joe harris dropped prominent supporters surrogates attacking warren months 
my thoughts similar she really check lot boxes ticket if somehow rep ohio would brainer reasons mentioned the whole easy imagine seems possible 
we really need though evidenced turnout much desperate latino believe nearly went trump compared like african americans 
she would eat face man that's debate want see 
bought amy kamala pete shirt last fall it meant ps biden stuff preorder taking forever edit would add gender balance bring south lower midwest big time 
do guys think bussing thing first debate problem line can used republicans sow discord ticket 
completely disagree kamala helping biden being black california think enough help joe obviously going take general election already well voters also debates performance got worse time 
politics another bernie sub guys downvote like anyone 
the brothers bernard virus claimed another sub and vaccine still months away 
the jesse matters white illinois secretary state forever endorsed joe he democrat parents would vote trump era 
ugh right politics posts praising bernie 
someone posted kamala's endorsement hours ago burried less upvotes 
yikes kidding not single post kamala but like ten jackson top 
i'm noticing well plus seeing lot trash sources lately 
you posted article someone already 
think booker would add lot he joe folksy style connect really well voters as far net positive marketability ticket winner 
booker man wish made lot it always mystified support 
they're likely upvoting fact jesse jackson endorsed bernie they act like guy run years impact election mean i'm stupid enough think he'll michigan 
politics misleading name people going think getting fair balanced news kind troll forum got trump elected 
and hopefully we acquired vp attorneys general supreme court justice whatever heck wants 
even dem voter base we'll take 
liked castro supporting president february made ridiculous attack biden still quite help liking though if would apologize great 
while love stacey know enough national name recognition vp definitely deserves cabinet position it would amazing charge federal voting rights commission sham like administration tried investigating voter fraud 
like klobacher think could help northern midwest including wisconsin hardest must win state biden harris would great vp stronger ticket ec and look forests explain support someone called segregationist racist 
she turned obama's offer ag 
could pete deliver indiana or still long shot 
think lot conventional wisdom right basically saying lost lower black turnout detroit philadelphia milwaukee there's hope someone connects community well like abrams harris might way bring back closer obama levels we'll carry three states 
yea did see politics sub super tuesday front page posts bernie leading winning states biden whooped ass double number bernie's state wins if get know decisive victor lol 
joebiden feature links website please submit unreliable extremely biased sources bot action performed automatically contact moderators subreddit message compose questions concerns 
saw tapper cover biden endorsement bit but pretty funny disease democrats invented taking coverage away 
think joe already locked black vote 
think she'll lock black vote admire appreciate endorsement 
that's bernie's people mo almost like ownership huh 
it's sad even subreddit falls lies bernie sanders supporters 
joe building coalition big tent 
definitely think possibilities catherine cortez masto stacey abrams amy klobuchar all help secure valuable constituencies democratic party us electorally pete buttigieg run senate indiana kamala's unfair takedown biden cool actions good compared biden's record public defender 
that's cubans puerto ricans lots long term r's even trump handled maria aftermath rican side family still 
eh doubt tbh actually fit well theme the fact kamala get along bruised debate miami indicative work bringing country together folks we're bitterly divided nation oftentimes seek see divides us separates i've proven build diverse coalitions worth folks every isle we need help combat malarky 
pretty sure biden outdoing aa vote still her booker 
mike gravel don riegle also least current house members compared eight bernie four teh squad 
point sanders movement look around realize order achieve goals admittedly noble impractical ideas need least strong allies within establishment accomplish being congress years way makes one part he's long represents small state independent streak and that's fine people vermont chosen time represent but would never elected statewide new york maybe i'm extreme pragmatist wholesale revolutions politics rarely end well the russians thought overthrowing czar going fix everything same cuba venezuela elsewhere revolutions beget counter there sanders' platform wonderful implement rebel outsider best 
wow bernie even plan eradicate senate colour surprised i'm kidding course let's get trumpkin levels conspiracy theory im inclined go mccaskill notion warm collegial made many friends vs joe inspires friendship almost anyone regardless party 
all sort drive blanket smears hurt sanders sooner later got realize us vs democratic party losing solution you want votes yet smear core people need bernie says not us especially reddit feels like realize we're side mostly things we may different ideas get ultimately actually yelling loudly virtues internet so knock stop hurting attacking disagree issues that's great important stuff talk stop implying perverse motives working 
you're incorrectly representing biden said he told rich people going demonize raise taxes and they're tax increase even affect lives that's meant fundamentally change the fact lie make case shows weak argument 
yep got downvoted saying voted biden 
yeah read revolution controls group go think awards give bernie posts might fake actual users fine news sub different name misleading manipulative 
the day bernie bro time kill retorted removed mocked bros comment another thread later banned shit show 
oh think cory would fantastic ticket selected feel like jim clyburn tipped hand said preference african american women stacy abrams got considered front runner right kamala feeling tbh 
yeah jackson articles ahead but harris endorsed bernie know shit would got sticky 
politics fair balanced news way fox news 
kamala harris endorses joe biden president 
here's tweet https twitter com kamalaharris status 
hopefully enough tip washington loss every primary might end bernie's scorched earth campaign 
and girl endorsed joe biden 
super tuesday would've nice better late never 
me would like see kamala vp 
too little late she endorse endorsement could made tangible difference hope gives nothing 
here's forecast next two tuesday's https projects fivethirtyeight com primary sorted date number delegates stake biden ahead all moment except idaho bernie tied likely hit viable threshold florida mississippi possibly missouri illinois hopefully does meet beat forecasts get race least relegate attention tulsi gabbard getting march michigan washington north dakota pledged ohio arizona 
don't i'll never get chance vote president hopes vice 
there alot people respect even get much votes primary no need hostile towards man 
if referring ca think would mattered bernie always going grab good portion neighbors due sanders invested state vs around diamond joe plus fact deeply progressive politics largely become intramural sport democrats biden voters seem baked contest since get go given tightening race seeing ballots counted the folks already leaning towards swayed kamala harris endorsement 
she wait warren exit her endorsement pay dividends future 
her endorsement could still make difference 
rules road homie not cool 
hope chooses cabinet based feels would rally support country best job thinks loyal personally the latter method trump 
quick someone say mean things idaho make vote us uhm your potatoes mediocre best biden like real square don't 
biden forms broad coalition support bernie bros let tell actually good sign coming revolution 
i'm happy biden getting endorsements 
what hell wrong hope opponent dies that beyond hateful ashamed 
as bernie supporter gross helping please consider quietly supporting bit mature 
that sounds awful lol completely different platforms andrew yang appeal voters actually matter 
agree she favorite early went pete joe yeah took shots like that's game she's good country tough smart 
plus fact deeply progressive state politics largely become intramural sport democrats we voted legalizing pot think twice gay marriage the radically want biden certainly going win california even without boomberg's endorsement trailing like delegates behind bernie when results i'd surprised bernie crosses vote 
she warren apparently close give props loyal friends politics but glad joined team 
she good reason need make enemies friends 
appreciate personally it's good see friends actually now officially team joe mind seeing get vp nod 
independents republicans liberals many right wingers 
yang appeal voters biden want ubi thing andrew known it would never work 
'biden became president today' even republicans deserting trump coronavirus response 
lets get confident lot happen november 
unfortunately huge difference republicans trumpublicans 
aside loving biden supporter want add well written article absolutely worth time family huddle grandfather old cold war bunker 
joe walsh illinois ex congressman recently attempted challenge trump gop primary predicted trump's disastrous speech biden's response would remembered inflection point boosted former vp's chances occupying oval office time next year and we'll occupant claim kenyan trying statesman pulling birth certificate bs one short ago don't forget trash 
this quote article after three half years absolute asshole white house american people want breathe and really believe biden know feel like pause 
wish president today we cannot trust trump guide us plague eight months long time infections double weekly 
this really hurting right honestly i'd rather trump handle situation well lead getting elected instead preferred candidate because would save thousands millions lives but sadly going january earliest get rid guy 
but many people actually saw speech 
what pence trump die get acting president nancy pelosi 
lot happen november too much 
yeah people behave different voting booth present outside buy suddenly broke good 
given spread lot guaranteed happen bad things this tax break target california we can't work vaccine cure wyoming massachusetts the group overwhelmingly votes going vulnerable hopefully they'll agree winning indeed tired much 
agree undeniably bombshell trump appeal many undecided voters come november and let us forget could certainly decide race catapult biden oval office 
for one thing trump could die coronavirus we know exposed old 
yeah i'm getting real vibes headline 
yup hillary vs trump late march 
hope lot happen would gladly trade biden presidency trump handling covid situation well 
yeah my dad republican trump biggest idiot whole world worst person charge mom trumpublican why biden talking going handle i'm sure he's mad cdc screwing plus mean many people died flu italy 
and election cycle neighbor drops corona old lady sat next church idly stock market dip little see republicans put red blue fight hold vote like americans 
there republicans there's trump cult the gop lost cause 
i'd say multiple exposures trump infected maybe anti science don''t need learn anything i'm naturally talented attitude may end ending presidency early 
she'd make amazing president i'd rather charge right instead trump biden 
hope favorable polls correct work like least 
what concerns short peoples memories by nov people may even remember especially whatever october surprise bombshells inevitably drop 
let's hope much better beat 
as much hate even consider possibility joe could he's exposed he's older 
can't take two states give trumpublicans berniecrats rest us live peace 
can't get banner love also yeah gop let patients run asylum gave sarah palin vp convince base vote trump at point i'm convinced thing make trump's leave families start dropping dead even probably would great shock sense self admitting best means admitting liberals might sit well mind 
wanna believe true the people risk ones watch fox news shows say hoax taken seriously some network starting speak trump hold know better sad it unfortunately take serious tragedy wake realize living one incompetent leaders history 
unfortunately mostly true know people still party trying change inside trump goons pretty much hijacked good seems 
this scientists cdc believe hate ignorance narcissism present sort natural immunity covid they still trying understand mechanism behind 
but also less likely touch face pandemic stare fucking eclipse 
she could president january something happens trump pence 
doubtful big pandemics like often subside summer come roaring back fall 
people know much money the crux trump election argument may like if stock market november near slightly january screwed 
bloomberg attack ads take care problem 
dead family members tend extend memory 
yes personally former republican want crush landslide 
california texas asked secede past let give 
everything fox news talks the migrant caravan example something see hell unless know soldier stationed afghanistan iraq nebulous problem your neighbor friend spouse getting sick maybe dying that's gonna hit home leave mark 
i'd like see face legal financial ruin crimes hell lot damage months he's subject kind accountability if virus gets first benefit rid well worth missing trial that measured deserving lives saved coronavirus health care immigration environmental regulation ways trump's uniquely bad decisions getting people killed and much rather negligence someone would go jail 
think it'll landslide it'll close election biden still underdog

aww dicta long time see 
the top right menu reddit app 
you right thank coming sharing us hope feel welcome perspective valuable shared values 
yeah president want back senate she's damn pit bull capital democrat still got bits bloomberg teeth 
he would chose already lowliest kennedy trying get senate seat everyone fights 
work conference come worse time considering pete news lol took days offline focus now back many pete buttigieg mods joined mod ranks we stronger together happy still working vision america even different week ago lfg 
totally agree and sub adopting rotr work no time waste ramping november pitter patter 
keep thinking years ago joe biden sarah palin debating vice president and democratic frontrunner singing baby got back bear costume 
worst decision john mccains career not think would beaten obama palin choice stands alone pure political play favors 
was she thrown show terrible just like vp election and marriage 
my favorite snl cold open still tina fey amy poehler announcement sexism campaign right grim reaper steve bannon jeff sessions mantle oh omarosa pounding windows man good ones last four years 
one things like others one belong 
sounds like things worked right 
palin hamfisted political move vp pick i'm glad true grassroots politician representing us no malarkey joe 
moments like remind sometimes karma kick 
and performance still coherent one 
think way republican could disastrous bush administration the democrats run almost anybody obama certainly helped widen margin mccain knew gamble slim chance victory society ended bearing cost 
mccain wanted pick joe lieberman advisors talked 
one city's alternative weeklies ran endorsements edition drawing palin style hope nope needless say john mccain receive endorsement 
he forced pick religious right true believer some people think deliberately picked idiot hopes could replace national security focused choice later 
imo she symptom definitely canary coal mine malarkey 
meh i'd go newt beginning malarkey palin first sign growing stronger republican party whole 
she thrown show terrible thank pete 
everyone arms liz vid that's best thing come last week's daniel craig episode plus heidi sketch deep quotes maybe feels bad coming mulaney byrne 
yup joe good bad points he's genuine come that's amazingly refreshing several years insane lizard beings power 
well shit if lieberman mccain's running mate probably would left senate which means voting aca might gotten public option 
everyone arms liz vid what happened 
or republican might seat we'd another failed attempt healthcare reform 
new joebiden supporting free public college universities whose families make less according senior camp official 
correct i'm wrong similar pete proposed 
love still bernie supporters comments grumbling enough arguing bust why appreciate gestures come seriously either joe ignoring progressives pandering he cannot win people 
does scale full price hard threshold 
anyone know much plan cost worry hurt general election 
unpopular opinion support we using taxpayer money free college free community enough need address failing infrastructure implementing public option heavy renewable investment first foremost after attempt balance budget since national debt ballooning immense level done would open right soon say someone paid student loans 
hey means tested free college plan pete's 
unpopular opinion like biden already got nomination bag need go left 
oh boy biden slippery slope 
liked community college subsidization plan fear new continue inflate cost tuition state schools like student loans tax payers 
here https govtrackinsider com college act would aim eliminate tuition families making 
he officially announced twitter he's including parts warren's sanders' plans platform it's actually pretty clever move trying get support warren sanders becomes nominee plus seems like trump's chances reelection getting weaker whole fiasco 
for worth joe progressive's vote volunteer hours make warren vp i'll start donating 
really like change policy oh well probably pass either way he's still better trump 
biden seems adopting ned lamont done ct namely hr minimum wage free public college 
it's improvement guess hope appeals progressives we're gonna need young voters beat trump 
another biden plan would huge right i'm struggling figure go back college finish bachelor's degree even laons get pell it'll hard pay everything need something like 
good biden owes lot current strength candidates dropping supporting makes sense he'd try syncretize policies 
what student loans rest us bracket 
ugh hated plan bernie's anyone it completely elitist everyone paying go college zero requirement graduate pay back etc why get drunk years trade school you didnt 
as sanders warren supporter shifted biden first choice candidates longer viable thrilled one things respect joe vs bernie seems want president entire country agree uncompromising unable grow base the fact younger people lean left moderate wing democratic party we need defeat trump general set us continue winning future one thing like see cooperating sunrise movement create expansive climate change platform what good go far enough opinion 
undecided warren biden you idea unbelievably happy he's shifting left issues really care better holding feet fire universal hc environmental policy make him work for that endorsement lizzie 
for everyone unhappy get compromise compromise necessary things done in case help consolidate progressive vote joe much better general election future may direction it's good know willing capable we praise types characteristics surprised actually follows also plan still far cheaper bernie's basically pete proposing that said i'm glad see falling line voicing concerns shows think trapped cult personality like supporters people 
want lower costs community colleges state schools think still low interest public loans options refinancing forgiveness there people bad degrees go field he's going follow cover daughter's son's acting degree 
this bad policy politics bad the core college debt problem expense undergraduate tuition make worse federal government handing state colleges blank check charge much want promising cover their incentive possible students ignore cost entirely budget face accelerating strain every employee skyrocketing salaries facility spruced etc contractors lobby governments wasteful expensive projects universities pass costs form hikes pay all money could going help poor instead go whoever bestow upon people chose joe biden vision democratic socialist bernie sanders version understand wants support supports general election busters appeased rest would voted anyway undermine among everyone look intellectually dishonest because move 
on one hand support know fellow leftists board regardless jimmy dore progressives well impossible satisfy but nice joe extending thanks 
like tbh pandering making free help high costs 
would cover state schools well school 
what came families making less graduated already mountain debt not including small refinements existing ibr plan means cancelled years warren's cancellation immediately end senior citizen she reportedly met biden days ago did talk 
id go back school learn spanish 
this makes like biden better i'm still voting sanders ballot nomination state kansas 
pete love joe seriously taking best parts people's programs smart shrewd inclusive love it 
this bad policy he adopt approach england 
this pretty cool joe think help people 
it similar peres plan calling bernies make seem like trying reach progressives also biden wants adopt pete platform maybe democratic reform stuff since veterans policy 
pete's free sliding scale subsidies 
also nearly identical hillary proposed and pass it'll enormous step forward given totally free college incomes virtual non starter political environment 
it's similar actually quite bit closer hillary's old plan i'm sure pete hillary aware though pretend bernie's policy sucks that's way people politics media screaming bernie needs credit 
oh god please yes care age give warren vp day week 
because bernie talks perfection reason people oppose they conditioned believe well organized group opposing versus basic human selfishness 
the pandering accusation seriously annoying mean whole point representative democracy elected officials support policies voters want isn't exactly supposed work 
trump nothing biden help neediest bernie bros that's i'm gonna vote 
love still bernie supporters comments grumbling enough arguing bust why appreciate gestures come seriously either joe ignoring progressives pandering he cannot win people it's hard get enthusiastic people's plans sander's policies ignore possible negative repercussions 
'cause millionaires billionaires make enough money guess 
biden making mistake warren it help bernie sanders lite the minority people like want version real thing majority either this going make look unprincipled without gaining support and bad policy idea still less enthusiastically yesterday 
bernie warren supporter really happy move think make huge difference lot people also ready support joe became clear would nominee but hoping adopt student loan college cost plans 
that's i'd like know i'm usually hard caps imagine legislation would heavily modified existing proposed bills actually good chance passing 
yeah like know well might lot single income two family people making year that exactly ultra rich if pay full price make slightly less nothing kind shitty 
pete managed pay plans included things like so entirely affordable petes proposals ran surplus 
pretty sure free college supported though somewhat narrow margin id imagine proposal middle ground sorts would even 
while can't answer proposal specially new york state already something similar suny cuny cc free families making gets paid 
many state schools fairly cheap year kids income level especially poorer ones already receive aid public much student debt problem private and grad professional degrees even 
agree and unless i'm mistaken possible none 'free college' plans actually anything address cost shift paying costs taxpayers how come people see rising drugs everyone loses shit drug companies college one scrutinizes colleges spending money liberals running full speed towards subsidizing existing system without questioning today worth keeping community significantly efficient four year schools online education programs started tech facing jobs getting like google microsoft fraction price even charge get job make least against trump i'll vote blue sure 'moderate' dems going move left future may abstain choose far right candidates leave home 
if want people bottom catch free community college better idea free public mean less debt middle class mostly white there minorities graduated poor schools home lives prepare able get good year colleges the gap widen every lazy mediocre asshole advantages took prep classes accepted with cost reason single every tyler attend flunk partied drank whole time it's going th grade kids financial consequences priority needs pre first trade also tribal colleges hbcus we can't let youngest vulnerable fall behind still things lower tuition costs strengthen federal subsidies reduce go regulating profit provide complete forgiveness victims 
same i'm actually college right not fan tax payer dollars spent even inefficiently the costs ridiculous need work lower across board cut entirely at best support community colleges tuition free requirement obtain degree also sure cancelling student loan debt someone 
mean hillary ran cuomo implemented new york 
dont get vote feel like push away moderate republican voters he's hope i'm wrong 
the point adopting plan build bridges bernie people joe attract eventually drops 
exactly rather increased scholarships specific careers like cover students loans choose study education always need teachers 
we also enter recession i'd rather help people dire financial straights pandemic 
voted biden i'm bernie bro but surly debt adjusted 
https govtrackinsider com college act would aim eliminate tuition families making this plan biden adopting so berners wrong say bernie's replies tweet 
pete's plan apparently families make less 
mean hillary ran cuomo implemented new york 
think that's basically he's going concede he might endorse marijuana legalization 
exactly concerns feel like universities get scott free ridiculous prices 
it's exactly happen voted biden part avoid garbage wtf 
almost biden's platform except gun control policies minimum wage change college subsidization policy i'm really fan drift leftward appreciate trying compromise hope stay moderate enough general election think would make popular moderates independents republicans 
do financial aid package yet if qualify pell likely also scholarships 
seriously all us took loans get educated paying people go college is sort joke 
these free college plans almost always include trade school 
no reason take productive class's free money party hearty 
that legalizing marijuana rescheduling would go long way convincing progressives turn 
that's lose moderate republicans no thanks want joe hillary costed election 
i'm pretty sure biden already free community college platform also new announcement applies students' state school know went high around tuition flagship schools if i'd gone pell grant would covered third likely gotten several scholarships rest so we're mostly states ridiculously priced expensive 
they need make student loans defaultable that bring tuition costs 
first paragraph best whole forum second good 
pete plan black americans also fantastic specifically parts entrepreneurship area 
this bill supporting believe and literally written bernie rep jayapal so think really one https govtrackinsider com college act would aim eliminate tuition families making utm source share medium ios app name iossmf 
wish confrontational aware may come way anyway implying joe reach progressives 
and objectively bad idea anyway 
want warren charge investigating trump's corrupt ass dems win house senate 
how massachusetts republican governor gets appoint replacement 
doubt best warren become secretary education depending senate results

former warren supporter this one details plans really drew like student loan forgiveness phased still marginal impact it seems like fair effective way benefits need 
why black people stan joe biden 
this important distinction people dismiss like obama vp he incredibly loyal first black president almost experience senate years despite racial dynamic age gap massive backlash never strayed absolutely took cues guy national government less time and disloyal thing ever accidentally favor marriage equality 
in nonsense primary regurgitated fact joe biden gives shit he everyday nevertheless beats trump cares us 
think saw earlier reddit joe undermined obama one time support gay marriage 
there one time joe kind took lead made barack move forward bit sooner otherwise might coming support gay marriage think aged pretty well though 
joe biden supported comforted obamas stonewalled congress weathered untold volume truly vile personal attacks maybe remember shit bad what obama inherited collapsed economy two wars served loved respected hard times we presidential medal freedom ceremony know 
watch medal freedom ceremony https www youtube com watch szbfr ee hm joe received award proceeded tell everyone room great barack he didnt use moment people job he done says something man 
if want dose amazing check barack presents joe medal freedom 
racial injustice black mark nation joe biden gets 
think i've met single black person ever use phrase stan joe biden 
that roundabout way say he obama vp 
just gonna leave https www gq com story obama biden dont run fbclid iwar krmdlw bzba cmbityytzblbbwh kb ltbypu bgms txywc evd kuu 
biden would've anybodys vp power y'all really eat shit huh if biden gets nomination hope every sanders vote abstains votes trump instead 
also great friendship based mutual respect affection forgotten bracelets 
so saying biden want primary obama https nymag com intelligencer bernie sanders obama social security html instead respected backed saved country worst financial crisis since great depression huh 
interpret obama's vp comments saying vp like pence sits passively background nothing biden got lot work done direction support obama he active supporter 
remember seeing assholes wishing rape michelle girls the even yet that course revolting attacks things 
well thank much needed sniffle phone the way joe whips hankie turns back reminds dad except achieve true dadhood size bedspread 
there's difference working people basic common objective like tax code loyally supporting administration never primary policy maker losing said another way spin would biden gets much done even means unpleasant subordinating ambitions 
please go back divisive sanders subs dude ette the vp power 
jesse jackson called new york hymietown bernie support evidence faults plus mondale qualified candidate in dukakis lost probably could beaten bush nominated al gore dick gephardt never would stood chance 
you're reading wrong it's saying white man needs learn place black biden let qualifications pride ego age status get way loyal humble serving much less qualified also not many rich male politicians said 
is white guy there aspects black experience never understand for example cultural history men constantly positions authority sometimes abusive effect and power structure derived slavery act complete total humiliation means existing dynamics today age explained away simply longer exists joe support barack actively ally powerful position world quite frankly unprecedented it shows joes heart rooted traditional abused americans centuries element male but see author stating respect 
who would surely new standard bearer democratic party 
that article says bernie right opposing obama issues he issue certain compromises giving republicans in sane world would good story sanders campaign directly 
this feel confident supporting joe comment one di deux show like supporters willing listen respond without snark insults i've asked people support policy return civility ppl want missing current administration 
trump literally referred marchers shouting you replace us jews very fine people 
don't ya'll like subs go toxic mean what's stopping bernie getting positive pr except work within party structure promote progressives constantly shit talks how's our revolution going elect many congressional senate candidates blue wave nope basically struck https ballotpedia org he even endorse aoc primary maybe tee vee crowd little savvier give credit know works real world 
bernie elected white guy stand behind black happened bigot jerk furthermore election that earn points 
oh come this common knowledge 
mean sanders supporters and personal google concierge look shit try starting https www snopes com fact check biden kkk klan wizard please parrot republican russian propaganda elsewhere 
biden senator it literally job maintain working relationship people disagreed is obama racist robert byrd martin luther king jr great american true hero jesse jackson made progress important areas also expressed bigotry driven wedges laud achievements fighting excuse also world would definately better place ralph abernathy assumed leadership civil rights movement instead 
sanders supporters everything listed interesting gloss call republican candidate vastly supports policies good though gotcha you're absolutely right grand wizard shook hands high level kkk organizer meanwhile got locked actually protesting segregation if makes russian cyka blyat i'll wait gotchas abolishing student loan debt legalizing marijuana abortion anti iraq war take time we'll see come supporting bernie otherside continue pretend anything republican 
https en wikipedia org wiki unite right rally 
your precious saint bernie one fucking march fifty seven years ago ever since expected black people vote deadbeat dad ass nbsp meanwhile robert byrd renounced klan became fierce advocate civil rights much naacp gave eulogy now lying 
joe biden supports racial justice decades long time ago opposed bussing still supporting goal desegregation he favor running caught guard backlash state saw job represent views constituents was best thing no hundreds black leaders forgiven bringing pretty pointless left obama politically picked someone experience ticket well appeal blue collar voters rust belt jesse jackson made extremely bigoted comment saying hates jews prejudice also bernie endorsed scores antisemites says normal bigots hold opinions rather complete extreme want engage campaign genocide how many racists say well making racist statement the answer lot that basically several notable support rashida tlaib ilhan omar linda sarsour cornell west 
bad people group also fine sides you protest taking important statue renaming park robert lee another name 
calling israel apartheid state completely ridiculous reflects either ignorance misunderstanding antisemitism besides list people 
latest poll florida primary shows joe biden massive lead bernie sanders bloomberg warren 
top biden bloomberg sanders warren dates mar spread first place whopping misread everyone else threshold look prior margins pollster https imgur com pxiv ah png edit fivethirtyeight lists spread i'm sure rounded figures 
sanders chose place threshold unapologetically praising monster castro this bernie can't nominee it's way democrats lose florida november 
fl pledged delegates based completely realistic joe gain triple digit delegate margin alone 
and remember bloomberg still in race we got 
can't wait state end bernie 
the socialist label still bad florida 
this happens socialist praises communist 
imagine biden getting delegates with warren likely drop soon bernie probably get it going fucking massive blow 
sanders shit work florida massive cuban population their parents grandparents lived thru castro schmuck going around praising yeah good strategy 
surprised gets bloomberg dropping bernie supporters becoming discouraged 
bernie supporter also drag trump white house kick clown ass curb if biden get people come vote carry florida general way hillary great sick republicans constantly winning 
joe going get every delegate florida point 
this awesome take granted we must keep looking ahead continue everything win primaries 
yeah baby you go joe 
so much latino vote praising fidel castro tends effect 
actually hate bernie believe way delivers ideas able compromise that said glad biden well 
honestly surprised the state highest cuban population want vote somebody likes castro 
if biden takes delegates lol 
that comment fidel castro going kill primary general 
do need democrat vote fl primary 
fl house gonna vote biden phil ehr guy believe defeat matt gaetz 
yeah im believing horseshit lmao 
if joe wins nomination almost sure take florida trump 
lol biden going get delegates 
don't take poll seriously the polling agency st pete polls rated fivethirtyeight meaning might accurate its impossible deny biden beating sanders lot florida already knew specific percentage points edit this also taken bloomberg dropped 
florida might become california supposed biden 
holy smokes everything coming roses joe or say oranges even poll outlier favor he figures run roughshod bernie sunshine state the note warren dropping likely gets viability statewide lot congressional districts would stayed assuming numbers correct course subject margin error sample issues but pretty safe bet get cds possibly end day florida might end bern sanders enjoy press interviews along lines got butt handed peninsula feeling path forward 
then doubling story come pouted corner visiting american prisoner cuba telling understand everyone thinks bad 
absolutely moronic approach sanders surprising his inability win florida penn southern states means he's dead arrival general best thing drop getting beaten decisively end march 
really hope case position depend florida especially since lost thousands votes gillum desantis 
anyone knows anything florida politics especially among cuban americans know praising castro might well resigning getting virtually vote community and considering that's majority population state bad strategy regardless actual views cuba 
want guy think fact florida population years old tend view socialism well sense they also vote far heavily young people castro praise certainty help like much support amongst cubans anyways 
even biden became front runner convinced we'd lose general election bernie gets nomination i've enough elections know huge florida tipping balance polls poorly elderly cubans alone could blow chances 
florida going tough state even biden not sure think otherwise 
did call monster dude heard literacy program sure people died mean communism in service since exactly bernie bro would say 
exactly huge mistake points mindset values it also tone deaf feelings supporters whenever bring bernie brush away big deal smh 
honestly castro comments bernie sanders' tripling probably cost election it guarantee he'd lose florida made right nevada became frontrunner he signalled whole party dial back would countless house senate state seats helped push pete amy realizing time clyburn put foot considering mentioning mcgovern discussing endorsement choice 
we lose florida matter nominee florida's elections clearly corrupt undemocratic see happened lost votes midterms bernie made worse comments 
that would mean delegate split joe bernie meaning roughly vs really see happening but big lead could definitely gained 
there malarkey inspection stations border 
florida matter probably going trump anyway 
saw someone making fun exciting older voters votes matter less something 
cant wait either its going good theater 
the pro castro label still bad florida ftfy 
why socialist establishment come sanders yet rigged 
joe definitely nominee point it's matter whether break delegate threshold decisive victory sanders supporters basically denying inevitable 
with numbers sanders would get delegates awarded statewide the congressional districts pretty sure support concentrated major population areas orlando tampa miami so means probably even reach viability many congressional districts meaning biden take 
cubans florida quite bit different mexicans west 
the gashole wore assmask floor house representatives you mean trump loving fool giant cake hole passion anything repulsive that matt gaetz douche nozzle florida fantastic hate almost much ms lindsey nunes cow crime dog 
not get hopes vote count california probably halfway counted nate cohn https twitter com status be patient it's possible we're around half and patience goes ways things could go much better either sanders biden know see late mail the best outcome aside sort win sander's margin narrows delegates evenly split joe racks elsewhere primaries we may official result several weeks canvass period ends april however daily counts coming afternoon we'll idea look like 
warren dropping might favourable sanders many think looking voters well vote biden 
former prisoner recalls sanders saying 'i don't know what's so wrong' with cuba alan gross accusing bernie commending communist country senator came visit behind bars https www npr org former prisoner recalls sanders saying know wrong cuba that event happened years ago 
best thing sanders drop getting beaten decisively end march agreed know plays win lose bernie hang convention waging bitter scorched earth campaign taking cheap potshots biden radicalizing supporters this last election he's got nothing 
florida restored convicted felon voting rights that's eligible voters since last election not demographics shifted liberal 
nah florida dead call red the path general pa must win take swing states michigan wisconsin arizona my hope az leaning blue krysten's strong mark kelly run leaving us really deal mi wi on sidenote even though nc historically state many republican shenanigans voter suppression think grab 
florida yuge the current electoral makeup began obama allowed lot wiggle room democrat win unlike republican 
people got voting rights restored demographics shifted massive migration florida however bernie praise monstrous dictator many floridians escaped help 
it yes but biden solid shot winning bernie none 
there period castro would kill people bleeding dry selling blood products vietnam https www wsj com articles sb monster might kind bernie thinks deserves praise 
bernie's comments real effect biden's chances general election 
bernie reaching high longshot polling holds even takes warren voters undecided needs bloomberg lol even reach there debate two weeks campaigning things could certainly change held less unrealistic given poll 
you see happening bernie would lucky get numbers are even reading poll most bloomberg vote go biden giving around right even give warren think plausible joe surpasses reach viability dead serious better range outcomes there state imaginable worse demographically 
the coast guard redirected funding cracking narcotic smugglings malarky 
at least biden better shot winning general 
lol who needs older voters make memes sandersforpresident sandersforpresident 
bernie sanders talk black voters his excuse they're establishment it's really disgusting 
come this even disingenuous straight dishonest we're better spread clear lies candidates while agree fully talking castro positive light castro's literacy initiative he clearly said mostly wrong worst regimes sometimes get something right which true maybe avoid bringing dudes like but say he's pro we're 
wdym dude kyle kulinski said 
believe after tuesday seems unlikely biden reach majority 
yes gaetz literally worst rep hor 
biden even supposed reach viability california 
the west pretty much bernie territory population region disproportionately young urban white except ca az nm we prepare fact might win western states however western small populations except california supposed goldmine places turn sanders could washington oregon maybe arizona biden favored florida illinois new york pennsylvania these far delegates 
shouldn biden better california votes counted early voters favoured sanders gained ground late 
yeah think going go bernie already abandoned super tuesday the remaining warren voters pragmatic college educated really want revolution planned canvas florida matter chances winning nomination dropped i'm behind biden 
i've surfing various bernie subs seen far warren supporters coming sub alone totality different pro granted representative sample country still thought noteworthy 
that true still likely get sanders delegates florida primary could sweep 
it hugely favorable if takes viable joe might conceivably get votes lose delegates balance sanders hits lot places 
he imprisoned trying bring internet access cuba imprisonment lost pounds teeth horribly mistreated the us trade convicted spies but literacy rate fantastic know take good bad 
that event happened years ago wow just wow he really got kid gloves 
alan gross imprisoned cia spy as per wikipedia page https en wikipedia org wiki wprov sfla however went cuba fifth time late november arrested days later when carrying high tech chip intended keep satellite phone transmissions located within miles kilometres the available open market it provided frequently united states department defense also obtained state oversees usaid this literally endorsement 
if entire legacy spoiler sore loser

in va siblings voted well 
what important policy like biden opinion 
yeah must fake i've told biden supporters unenergized old people relunctantly vote think he's electable 
agree country seeking stability revolution 
there might silent plurality effect going early vast majority political posts see either bernie trump it seems possibly people actually want someone guy promises free stuff plan pay puts kids cages 
absolutely silent social media support pete biden otherwise get eaten alive harassed bernie supporters there lot younger people want angry revolution instead prefer stable inclusive administration 
same exist likely take action complain off topic strange angle photo seems 
we butti klob yang beto fam 
to fair there's like people picture quite proof yeah twitter reddit's demographic young it's male big city white combine russian bots rabid group bernie trolls discourage dissent awful guage actually won't stop saying could biden win know anyone progressive bubble supports dnc 
this proves internet reality holy smokes that's big one yes and admit wonder there's prop style polling effect showing sanders' numbers in california showed wide opposition amendment banning sex marriage buy actual vote pass the expected reason disparity socially acceptable stance asked people would announce opposed voted polls today social groups loudest members created impression support sanders mainstream opinion might seeing inflated on day proclaimed supporters lower turnout excuses i've seen include unable make lack faith system actually right these may true but they're also degree someone go somebody really keen 
think things sealed deal his huge win sc gotta love joe mentum pete's endorsement amy's asked saturday sunday pete dropped voting doubt 
that's amazing pa crucial come november thanks keep good work 
pete actually better among older voters younger know it'd true case prove disprove theory an explanation saw he's basically boomer ideal millennial saying bad thing 
yanggang absolutely would love pick holding breath guessing kamala nom though suspect biden administration tap position 
https www nytimes com us politics lgbt forum html 
like he's supporting bobby scott's safe act 
indeed gotta thank pete tho wouldn endorsement 
want get middle say hi slimjim 
going bankrupt broken arm stability 
you okay stability healthcare education system it want steady look big picture everything going change makes everyone uncomfortable necessary there many working class people struggling everywhere biden much average american at best get bank auto bailouts pay medical emergency rest lives don see getting bailed 
yup actually show vote unlike different candidates supporters age group 
texas glad could help take last night 
us citizen still support like long term investment 
man paragraphs fact almost like making false narratives based facts campaign's strategy 
theyre going implement public option isnt getting passed bernie knows 
the bank auto bailouts fact charging people afford healthcare first place extra tax obamacare voting slash social security where mr biden information policy website really see plans future whatsoever 
personally deciding biden warren ideologically lot progressive leaning didnt see path nomination decided gonna vote anyway someone respected deeply endorsed 
that biden doesnt care average american bernie fulfill incredible promises negative effects young people dont like etc 
https joebiden com joes vision took clicks 
so telling believe stuff you backed bloomberg weeks ago said would support whoever democratic nominee now essentially saying bernie case this might surprise decided yet from deduce cannot trust everything mr says his billionaire money supports biden campaign the redistributed throughout middle class country stop taking lover see situation like civil conversation think way does make sense doesn seem turn great end who funding 
hillary lost got exposed email controversy right election clinton associated impeached controversial president biden one best presidents recent history american minds racking huge numbers states never advertised even stepped foot imagine advertisements money bloomberg's campaign can't stand bloomberg cant deny he's valuable the candidate scared bernie he showed tuesday problems growing outside core voters his fanbase passionate definetly vote dem matter much biden's base show pollsif doesnt make worsening bernie's turnout plus far less likely get centrist votes 
literally today npr only people polled think sanders beat trump vs biden your fears completely misplaced thanks reddit twitter much likely tuesday proof need he also progressive platform right hillary ok 
so telling believe stuff like civil conversation see think way you come ragin' shouting everyone want suggest try tactic within movement ask young voters turning candidate endorsements former candidates deblasio marianne williamson one fellow senator endorsed state mate patrick leahy how get agenda senators needs board or all rigged 
so argued point proved wrong moving whole new claim anyway think missing things michael bloomberg allowed support candidate wants like donate just disagree doesnt make evil rich no i'm big fan but he's human he right campaign wishes biden accepting money foreign entity illegal source presidetial candidate new york mayor dont know last reasons makes hate much disagreement take away 
another reminder respectful sanders supporters tonight 
percent yes invite sanders supporters honest civil conversation ever issue people trying spread misinformation candidates polarise saying voting wrong candidate makes murderer understand lots looking get brighter future nation like called bro subset sometimes worst folks loudest 
just advice don't even go subreddit wish well try console the last thing want see hear biden supporter regardless intentions this change time days keep distance 
we want give reason hate us even say spiteful thing bigger person you know saying argue ignorance bring level beat experience well i've spoken lot friends bernie supporters bros they're rallying based emotion sentiment fight 
follow old saying start shit going subreddit long keep negativity good 
sanders supporter vote joe biden swing state trump must defeated we never see progressive legislation passed wins in fact foundation country planet risk 
yes please put egos aside focus real goal defeating trump sanders supporters disappointed mourning loss last thing need pouring salt wound and try shut sore winners supposedly biden we people stirring shit driving wedge two campaigns unity vital right 
focus on the main goal defeating trump we must bring people together better chances 
yes please respectful commenting urging bernie drop endorse if risk lot people bust 
know lot nastiness unfortunately need team joe let best bring rational sanders supporters back team the psycho ones stay home vote stein good people care social justice 
we must bring bernie sanders supporters much treat respect keep kind need defeat trump 
it's hard respectful bernie bust type supporters ones say writing reasonable sure 
the thing makes sad bernie supporter feel like place sane person go all subs delusional still win laughing demise 
so treat opposite they've treated everyone else got 
engage come us give space hope civility decency eventually sway right thing hope grow tough resilient americans 
agreed everyone may disagree end americans we differ run country 
wade subs pretty annoying come hot 
only return even try but hard mercilessly attacked support ngl 
don't comment sub upvote posts support rational thought like trying explain much worse years trump biden 
yes respect lol realized bernie going likely lose super tuesday that's started looking see joe biden's policies biden need start building unity tries interesting my first piece advice would showcasing supporters might like green energy plan housing etc 
i'm bernie's ideas biden nominee mean bernie disappear already impacted democratic platform continue 
maybe started respectful long ago instead telling everybody suck months end but knows maybe work hrc voters hates base it'll biden guess pray trump much worse supporters show might also win powerball these things theoretically happen 
consider progressive liked warren sanders going primary season knew shot first states really clear super tuesday joe got gigantic media bump day super tuesday endorsements kind however disagree like still race point know he'll drop convention actually hope i'll say party needs move left right unfortunately lot never trumpers voting biden signals campaign might appealing general election gets nomination want remain help conversation 
waste breath jobless losers wayofthebern dont think intelligence figure vote theres many anyway subreddit dead 
this time different bernie cannot win if drop point literally killing people stubborn ego lose respect ever man remaining supporters it end primary over three million needlessly went spread coronavirus yesterday sanders 
elizabeth wasnt well while she was promoted by the media then tanked smeared main ally these nowhere near situations 
see happening the politics really divisive we're seeing tons gloating people biden side humilated crushed destroyed bend knee stupid commies tantrum throwing forth that said though many sanders extremely toxic voting joe good grace say congrats luck decisive victory know like stand no wonder respect us 
we never forgive forget have fun losing november 
support sanders also younger voter cannot vote biden would able elections seemed fair establishment put fingers scale if merits fine but feeling like worth whatsoever bring the way could chose progressive vp said term president otherwise better opinion elect trump chance get someone aligned beliefs fear forcing choice lost youth long time you definitely election trying mean supporters understand friends feel think lose since boomers anyway older dems dem candidate independents corrupt without people combat trump's overwhelming lead can't see winning currently 
i'm voting biden want status quo moderate we one chance elect revolutionary figure sanders someone determined aggressively fight corporate corruption government provide sweeping basic welfare rights people i'd hate see go joe 
im sanders supporter even though convinced path good reason still race he voice left address true dangers climate change healthcare system social issues biden touching anywhere near enough keeps winning states large margins huge generational gap changing favor going come around progressive agenda wants reel young voters november 
really matter either way us bernie supporters never vote biden say this even voting you guaranteed loss trump so ones need accept happening don's warn signed middle aged woman 
it's mentioned time even though disagreements approach fundamentally want thing 
sometimes worst folks loudest think biggest contributor bernie bro stereotype they social media presence general pretty toxic naturally see disproportionately supporters that's reflection writ large live caucus state everyone generally polite supportive understood bigger one campaign 
posted question sub since looks like favored candidate sanders going lose try warm biden general appears silently removed 
yo i'm sanders supporter your candidate really alarming willing listen why guys like see much 
while bernie supporters definitely bro take offense wide sweeping generalizations we believe policies demonstrate tremendous compassion love people vote joe general stop pushing dragging pulling dnc help everyone small subset society namely rich connected 
mods sandersforpresident insta ban ya anyway 
does politics count one subreddits 
got banned commenting bernie still win post saying sounded like hillary staffers trying use faithless electors change election they're deadass talking much benefit coronavirus 
speaking welcome people coming sanders subs talk actual beliefs values plans however realize across reddit generally interest opinions challenge sorry shitty sure look post history disagree many things one bernie supporter open conversation anyone much love let get rid trump make america suck little less 
be respectful ignore hostility all say lot people hurt tonight angry things brazen enough online kindness empathy heart joe's message we already living hard crazy time don't add unnecessary bitterness 
yes that would probably worst strategy it must organic biden actually outreach 
the best way right give space let joe biden convincing coming days weeks he's much better respectful people internet 
seen zero nasty comments towards neutral positive bernie supporters whether they're aligning admitting things work whatever reason ton chapo maga trolls taking piss meh 
yup need heal divide exacerbate 
first i've treated well number sanders supporters many friends important paint wide brush but yes need treat obviously politically correct thing order unite party also right respectful human 
yes treat people kindly even way it shame asking question rhetorically something unheard 
biden need start building unity tries interesting mean disrespect say like weeks made strong effort reach buttigieg klobuchar warren voters i'm sure he'll sanders concedes 
biden's recent positions agreeing warren's bankruptcy plan sanders eliminating student loan debt free college tuition think moving right thing worrying 
respect opinion disagree just take look sandersforpresident bernie subs vitriol throwing biden it increasingly harder unify party continue attacking supporters become even convinced sit election we basically looking friendly fire among democrats already chosen winner 
how many right leaning never trumpers believe 
jobless losers quite insensitive there people losing employment caronavirus 
i'm wayofthebern subscriber continuing make figures wfh your stereotyping offensive self defeating 
otherwise would better opinion elect trump chance get someone aligned beliefs i'm sanders supporter this absolutely dangerous message send some thought back maybe victory progressive surge congress happen progressives lost in fact obama era wins crushed including vital environmental protections selling public lands oil gas companies speak imagine another years can live conservative supreme court generations likely end roe social understand frustrated older longer believe politically left biden share pain however ask rationalize moment instead making emotional decision any attempt pushing country impossible four we never changing health care student debt fighting income inequality installing worker our democracy sold russian oligarchs corporate america ransack every last piece progress undermine bernie acheived political system democrats much center right ago adopted many positions don't screw future you must strongly consider damage done 
status quo moderate preceded trump why next lead outcome if biden elected expect obama's rd term clone follow 
he's going come less progressive tone general actually things work we need younger voters care common goals tactics trump want biden different 
sanders lost precisely youth supporters always stay home given literally every age group votes twenty somethings strikes bad strategy tailor campaign toward 
here's one may convince folks like consider lgbtq laws priorities joe biden candidate discussing russia paid serious attention issue almost never talked when talk start getting election meddling business certainly lot putin dictator relationship trump disturbing ever heard discussed debate stage https en wikipedia org wiki anti gay purges chechnya quite frankly deplorable but aware adressed due seriousness unique that's pretty big anyone cares 
it's different he can't win welcome keep spreading message social media whatever gambits biden voters risk lives order prevent illegitimately stealing primaries due younger therefore less vulnerable would worse anything clinton 
mean idea sanders one addressing real dangers things like climate change social issues disagree healthcare factual 
good reason still race he voice left address true dangers climate change healthcare system social issues biden touching anywhere near enough aoc exists progressiveness going go sanders 
black woman i'm voting biden used sanders supporter it type sent away expect every see handwriting wall another trump term even women cost suspect many alternate complete supporters rate real ones vote remove scourge spite encouraging bragging support would soon chains exercise right contrary choice too told end primary it's gauntlet throw reject emphatically general this tell americans overwhelming erase poison propaganda infects political campaigns people general the positive change happen administration go long way towards be best niceassme md 
yep we bus route going direction make sense take opposite helping trump win spite 
respectfully i'll get banned anyway that's true sanders' message system broken we've seen business usual work look even trump throwing ubi begging insurance companies stop profiting second people tests care crisis joe business return normal nothing change administration scary believe moment two sides remotely want thing disaster win loss humiliation go decades 
except dont biden wants return normal which failing decades put america behind every first world country we need big changes supporters want fundamentally totally different things im bashing supporting but getting progressive votes clinton didnt get 
but yang gang wasnt nasty really big social media tube presence 
sometimes top level posts get marked spam mods election days influx trolling we answer qs daily thread sorry 
howdy think safe say biden first second maybe choice us subreddit tripled membership last couple weeks candidates dropped amped presidency reading policies made feel lot better read reason deep dive know option left relieved finally went whole website pleasantly surprised even so wants minimum wage universal pre community college trade schools decriminalization marijuana expulsion related offenses increased funding mental health addiction services end incarceration drug use repeal citizens united right work legislation carbon tax ban new fracking operations recently adopted sanders college all families make less plan warren bankruptcy checked important boxes wish legalize full realize proposing way chance getting passed exactly improvement in exciting news pushing high speed rail investment improving public infrastructure policy https joebiden com infrastructure lgbtq equality america world healthcare perfection easily massive his rural rural addresses hospital closures modernization farms help farmers providing internet access areas weaves expertly climate since bernie guy probably going want see plan strengthening worker organizing collective bargaining unions empowerworkers and honestly impressed government reform governmentreform it far expansive thought would anyway start looking become stan perused excited got there improvements progress huge relief 
think many ideas going direction sanders way much pragmatic realistic yes medicare all great end goal feasible moment for example start public option health care least 
as primaries end question becomes less like prefer fight biden least receptive progressive changes going push much pushed so shift trying elect senate congress win if people could deliver wave bernie said need lot wanted still accomplished 
for biden lot polices maybe kinda like disagree think bad with sanders policies disastrous 
instabanned undecided warren supporter trying engage misgivings campaign see could sway wonderful people guys 
the way sub run makes wonder mods russians trying influence election asking people donate point wishing sanders stays achieves things kids losing money going vote risking getting sick why would anyone want 
you literally hurting joe biden's chances becoming president stop entering subreddit 
it true saw several posts corona virus helping 
so here's something never get sanders supporters answer if affordable universal health care need also ban private insurance the responses tend though yeah read question would anyone want one wants industry go away fuck corporate shill or silence 
oh man influx assholes sanders subs coming screaming theyre glad communist killed biden its happening turning people like away im already pretty bidens policies hoping would reach try get back hard believe though partially decided supporters voting trump spite bad blood clinton bernie feeling way 
or exercise tumor you feed cancer 
thank post comments the internet makes easy vicious way encounter person pretty pleasant experience today sub randomly awarded gold simultaneously downvoted point lot biden supporters talked issues good faith mirrors happens sitting across friends support different candidates silver lining tonight even bernie st choice running voter turnout great year always going vote democratic candidate sense peace is possible us make trump one term presidency 
you treat people one way kind disappointed they've conducted 
none taken see anything he's done far real outreach bernie supporters that's probably least part versus biden yes whenever drops i'd curious looks like saw speech gave today talked directly seems good first step 
sandersforpresident progressive narrative they definitely many subscribers others progressives representation congress moving forward without presidential nomination some contingent always going push isolation trump's campaign go scorched earth lies anyway strategy can't fight fire unless plan sink level being objective biden handle case showing hand still extended supporters mean lot we might different priorities work together that's lesson teach engaged good faith political arguments 
think lot conservatives like trump voting joe biden hope party trying appeal likely vote gop general election need see campaign move left 
biden's goals include hitting climate policy benchmarks need reach avoid catastrophic change just one example moderate always virtue 
this myth youth turnout many places went it's older apparently also slightly larger amount youth percentage and especially insidious say considering terrible way elections conducted country have heard stories young people stuck hours line vote eventually leaving get back work the retired voters obviously problem far conservative able stay 
joe still largely bound corporatism healthcare climate change policies nearly aggressive if look history senate throughout decades surprising big chunk sanders supporters trust would rather fight like hell blue congress vote green rd party general point fine trump presidency house years neoliberalism 
even sanders going go support biden wins continue working senate implementing progressive policies god forbid trump 
same bus route really haha seriously though vote blue everyone 
change takes time it's intrinsic system bernie populist like trump promising radical change proof work polls show people overwhelmingly trust biden handle crises pretty obvious in crisis last thing want revolution they responsible pragmatic think barney frank pondered whether pragmatism enemy idealism necessary adjunct bernie's case sees two odds he's gotten little done terms legislation years senate although important driving ideology politics hand spent career making incremental meaningful country he might pass ridiculous purity tests supporters apply undeniably moved left said speeches goals return normal means building changes obama presidency way that's actually attainable running platform many still adore call republican fault idealistic truth voters realized achievable 
warren supporter explains voting biden 
the sad thing i'm reading think probably got so much shit post edit oh ffs went pull thread user's comment history see response triple gold comment removed moderator literally could less surprised tried 
left never forget what weird ass threat lol 
this tangentially related post mention percentages reminded keep seeing idea joe platform elizabeth far apart is gulf real big someone could agree one people overestimating difference policies 
when pete dropped tried swoop like vultures still grieving even started considering endorsing biden vast majority us teampete mentality like rotr yeah spent last six months calling rat fuck traitors shills closet republicans it easy choice support joe especially endorsement came take big slice sanity side inclusion dr pepper thanks 
the 'left' forget she endorse either people tried hard her explanation wanted stay neutral let voters decide want and would work could whoever nominee most people labeled moderates we 'the left' liberals progressives big group join team tell us 
yeah say probably left leaning biden person right literally afford another years trump morally logically practically if wins climate crisis escalate beyond control people poor hurt absolutely nauseating polarization finding getting excited diamond joe gotta win 
cannot believe much invective sanders supporters directed elizabeth warren represents every good characteristic progressive movement possibly think her principles rock solid plans strong and they're willing change policies make better admire intensely but guy bernie bros treated terribly that's reprehensible it running biden she fights hard fight clean fair deserves vp slot bernie's constitutional lawyers right legal treasury secretary time 
warren sanders lot policy ideas one big reasons people went warren instead sanders like tone campaign 
the bernie bros upset warren endorsed yet they seem think must nice go figure 
yea many warren supporters know included heavily value critical thinking skills unfortunately somewhat scarce trait society so maybe conceed point biden campaign way win dem nomination well though plans rather via name recognition demographics my primary tmw state easily gop get general ms choice someone voted sanders years ago want add almost meaningless vote liberal mississippi person going personally feel analyzing numbers trends or much less progressive like overall popular column towards uniting party behind ending contest convention yea subbed plan voting even bottom first debate appreciate things looked rough waited correct moment play big cards led sc super tuesday bernie's biggest card aoc endorsement gain momentum heart attack the took wind warren's sails since happened months votes cast 
my best friend talking warren years last week instead crying super tuesday thrilled bs nominee 
warren supporters good people they seem extraordinarily communicators yet ridiculing insulting give great response like eloquently explaining prerogative met vitriol downvotes removed comments it's awful they've treated 
really interesting take by way subreddit 
the left never forget lmao bernie bros delusional 
my primary support bernie voted but would feel upset voting biden november not even holding nose like hillary two came subreddit could better understand offer get bubble centrists progressives generally agree priorities question differ recognizing allows common ground meet middle seeing compromised ends the way beat trump unifying wings happen communication understanding outreach 
talked back yang sub think there's basically two camps bernie supporters ordinary folks health care priority like support he's one strongly associated socialists like actual socialists even though far right closest they've got call real believe anarcho socialism true nastiness almost entirely second group 
are bernie bros gonna apologize shit show or force 
this really good insight one thing priced sanders' polls nationally shit he's put dem party various points last years going spill onto general electorate know would work can't imagine helping us much there's always double standard left need realize sharpish 
yeah moderate democrat worked so well 
all campaigns every side brings toxicity its politics worked long time what need stop toxic amongst realize greater evil agree campaigning negative attacks unhelpful biggest problem along opposing how expect win bigger race beating shit teammates also im trying argue ass finished weekend writing large final paper decided vent post apologize comment came across anything dems fighting personification satan sits power 
wish guts post there things cannot without getting raked coals calling mlm bullshit anything might make look like biden fan 
out curiosity someone support candidate lies friend sexist sanders even called snake never said anything this guy full shit either forgets facts is warren supporters vote biden look like 
who fucking cares can please agree anyone better trump instead splitting heavily amongst right stays unified unifying democrats rather biden vs bernie supporters focus kicking orange piece shit fake ass family curb 
what post tells people vote biden platform not trump bernie candidate unclear simply alternate enough beat i'm sure somewhere majority coverage mainstream media online relate likely nominee policies and knows maybe electability trumps race but romney first foremost obama campaign stand area biden's needs dramatically shift focus one bring meaningful change else going repeat 
coalition building bernie team problem one biggest strengths primaries duke it supposed antagonistic this person essentially making electability argument given supported warren interested hear felt electable biden edit rephrased clarity 
trump literally moderate much worse fanbase mean bullies also racist sexist and still want vote lose anyone following post's line thought please watch video https youtu bkdge rceoa progressives notable history winning general moderates losing we can't opportunity beat bernie's supporters there's stake 
imagine thinking biden better shot beating trump bernie dude can't even complete sentences they're turning next democratic debate town hall pre screened audience questions think feet if guys see know tell 
shocking behavior mod staff there nothing post attack anyone nothing derogatory rude candid attempt break dismissive dogma explanation totally valid position and removed running religion politics forced renamed reddit together place genuine danger democracy disguised source news 
their second edit tripped automod they also used kind troll sanders supporters if part bit could approve 
yep i've returned times explain decided switch bernie dispel lies edited stumbling video biden says trump win just got permanently banned honestly im even upset good time th hour bernie's campaign anyway he's probably going recover numbers hes running president so become lefty care 
kind weird thing say people could help save sinking ship 
it would credible threat actually voted 
in years young bs voters actually politically mature enough vote large numbers the boomers largely left political stage at point get much leaning policies need combat global warming crises republicans ignored exasperated also likely earth 
they correct the left forget bernie made extreme views completely toxic 
get side say to jackasses 
the left done fucking nothing years they'll forget 
it's hard say subjective everyone people give different weight policies for example think biden climate change plan but asked bernie supporter would dosen't one see grand enough 
no and would disagree saying subjective it's joe warren objectively agree vast majority issues even bernie their differences largely degree approach much substance where substantive still like opposite sides political spectrum they envision different solutions problems recognize gop either argue even fact good things the idea biden patently absurd so unfortunately makes want discount entire post despite otherwise well written this somehow far removed supposedly progressive candidates policy wise completely wrong harmful 
is gulf real big someone could agree one people overestimating difference policies really find worth train thinking politics america want and ideology fairly insignificant compared governing ability building coalitions forming alliances etc in case sanders good bold revolution never makes past senate warren ambitious desires greater economic restructuring but important work imo stabilizing force consensus democrats better job not mention obvious things like gerrymandering voter suppression 
the 'left' forget tonight might learn already 
yang gang bernie joe really exciting we need senate warren democrats get stuff passed biden believe withholding endorsement july convention 
dude whole sanders subreddit calling pete cia plant said actually gay chasten actor shit like they're completely toxic 
warren core believer capitalism you imagine played true socialists bernie's camp she's every good thing progressive movement traitor 
see also find absurd wouldn't things better everyone voted policies who cares another voter people petty 
that warren much higher candidate rankings bernie even goals similar his long history pseudoscience disregard evidence shows thought process strive ideological purity results dangerous game play people's lives line 
agree everything happened leading super tuesday probably single brilliant piece political strategy i've seen lifetime 
just note one mods commented elsewhere thread stating comment removed edits violated subs policies it seemed reasonable 
we take solace fact chance hell he's going run maniacs disperse among candidates the presumptive dem nominee assuming trump reelected probably whoever joe picks running mate grooms given much office ages people would surprised tried second term 
these two people moderate therefore must person 
there fallacy reason think sanders would hillary lost 
the moderate wretched despised megalomaniacal entitled borderline autistic woman caught cheating issuing marching orders media worked biden lovable goofball takes train work adored blue collar workers decades 
looks like one candidates great job uniting party 
the problem though one campaign consistently run toxic hate fueled bid dem nomination 
it bringing awareness campaigns toxicity if learn lesson may never hurts democrats long term 
kyokai think say people general vote biden of course platform somewhere https joebiden com joes vision we're quite familiar plenty us voting stands like pushing justice safety lgbt usa worldwide lgbtq aggressively pursuing corporations wage theft exploitation workers empowerworkers changing law include escaping domestic violence hardship extensions permit early withdrawals retirement funds vawa covering everyone public healthcare option even can't afford pay premiums providing tuition free community college vocational schools smoothing transition bachelors programs capping forgiving amount debt student obligated beyondhs just unfamiliar mean voters 
you warren supporter libertarian how work 
obama moderate bill clinton your post makes sense 
what works one election cycle dosen't work another current event expierences voter demographic changes prime time anti establishment candidate we got trump that passed people want unity 
biden hilary literally left obama good try sport 
what say bernie person beating double digit margins states nationally 
if honestly believe sanders trump clearly can't even beat biden lol 
dang assumed cth politics deteriorated much past years or maybe i've grown conservative remember sub liberal unfathomably sheltered echo chamber 
what politics going biden nominee practically inevitable are spend time posting hate screaming vote will endorse trump happen 
arrpolitics quarantined mean basically rotten chapo sfp point 
out curiosity edit shame removed initial comment well written 
got permbanned back answering direct question voting bernie so par course 
as warren supporter want us that's fine really give shit lol warren's still senate passing progressive policy within democratic party they're sitting home talking purity tests 
bernie sanders supporter come say denounced anyone uses hate vicious attacks candidate including warren biden tell vote support fighting clean fight he may ultimately lose nomination man practices preaches don't let voices radical shape opinion ask judge campaigning if believe cup tea definitely people sides could use chill pill no matter go important thing end day 
sanders supporters disenfranchised you wait drop voting age bernie unstoppable 
biden said bridge younger generation politicians push change implicitly people like booker buttigieg knows supports can't happen environment beset sides right wing and revolutionary populism that's needs next 
eh bernie extreme really he poor campaigner picked awful people run campaign org if look even though pretty much dem frontrunner totally bombed https ballotpedia our revolution 
do really mean that warren supporters quite sure turn get side to trump or misunderstanding 
funny think bernie climate change plan presidential authority would actually allow harm progress legislative agenda politically unpassable generous ignorant actual implications 
might exceptionally ehhhhhhhhh bernie one role is really important senate dragging people left doesn't mean want give keys white house i'm perfectly happy spend rest career yelling healthcare 
consider pragmatic liberal agree it important progressive voices stay strong help joe move us forward wins 
reading candidates subs primary gotta say bernie sub reminds little donald kinda like two sides coin 
go ton posts saying biden dementia it shame 
this let forget sanders staffer loved throw around slur said chasten inches away becoming bored methhead housewife 
agreed running toxic campaign staffers spread conspiracy theories factor 
politicians cater base though if toxic expect reflected politician governs wants calm rationality they'll get reward throwing fire bombs that's 
i've yet figure life whether i'm pragmatic idealist idealistic pragmatist yeah even years agreed bernie done never quite believed capable lot managed say 
that mod said user merely quoting vitriolic comments received proof mods approve situations like they used excuse remove eloquent comment 
cool provided several links campaign website the important question people talking where coverage points media why almost none submissions top page subreddit platform things genuinely excited biden brings gravitating charisma rally earlier tonight detroit mention half posted fact matter voters even joe issues seem backburner electable candidate come front center we're going big trouble general election 
to honest trying figure support ideological box neatly fit would probably give headache ultimately edit clarity saying supporting warren referring person screenshot 
obama ran progressive bill clinton outlier election ever independent votes meaning even big win watch video makes point way better 
it really say anything bernie it's telling democratic base easily swayed issue 'electability' voting candidate despite fact agree almost policies just like post letting incredibly small percentage ill behaved people outweigh needs hopes millions others 
it legitimately become anyone transgresses true god must silenced arguably toxic die hard trumpers 
mean apparently right antonin scalia supported hillary think people tired self radicalization want return normalcy sanders selling democratic party 
it's fine election season then bots get involved hellscape all anti hillary stuff now pro rnie unsubscribed 
nah i'm warren supporter got called republican warren it's 
that's happened expect lot bernie bust arguments former biden supporters saw light fabricated crap russia huuuge right they're retooling getting burned villifying bloomberg much forgetting oopsie 
they quoted pms got triggered automod called kind people its policy let edit comments troll call 
column ruth bader ginsburg th birthday motivation democrats back biden 
kudos hanging she's fighter many fronts 
my heart stops second every time see name headline 
democrats able pass legislation without veto motivation back biden an epa hands coal companies net neutrality blue states forced expend resources fighting every muslim ban gun printing executive order protecting national park system and yes allowing ruth bader ginsburg retire torch another liberal justice 
if there's anything learn republicans blindly backing party get sc justices want so important elect democrat year flip senate seats 
if get chance watch rbg documentary she unbelievable 
but vote trump protest general election force dnc realize powerful turd need rig primary favor socialist something 
let lady vacation elect democrat 
yep reason would vote joe 
lot sympathy rgb's situation she's position every cough makes national news it's tragic honestly current balance court fine mind trump could work deal sort replace like minded justice 
unpopular opinion incredibly selfish resigning election if trump gets choose replacement set court back generation 
it took reading word number realize holding breath 
thanks you've actually made question neverbiden stance 
we absolutely flip senate keep eleven democratic seats https www towin com senate election go four tossups try leaning republican kansas one watch pat roberts retiring if kris kobach wins gop nomination think candidate barbara bollier shot she recent party changer moderate state senator favor medicaid expansion flipped house seat another hopefully 
another unpopular opinion think supreme court actually much less concerned partisan politics people justices making decisions based political outcomes 
damn unpopular but respect hell almost agree love rbg put anyone criticism great stuff 
obviously move would help democrats that's heavily disagree democratic voter the supreme court playing game politics making decisions based law partisanship factor cannot allowed become otherwise there's point scotus system checks balances broken judicial branch weakened legislative strengthened plus keep mind precedent backfire if conservatives liberals set fine every single decision ruling interests we want it fair anyone 
think important remember president one person party control means hundreds people across political spectrum chance make progress agendas if like biden's stances progressive enough good seriously sarcastically the best way go get biden office keep working grassroots movements would left because lot stronger support vp trump pence focus lesser two evils talk wrong approach this really possibility change vs obstructed it better option bad ones 
she recent party changer in state like kansas seems good thing lot moderates probably relate 
another unpopular opinion court decide laws make 
think justices making decisions based political outcomes if agreed lol 
so wish organizations like federalist society ensuring there's pipeline young activist conservative judges fill lifetime appointments levels thanks gop stonewalling mcconnell filling vacancies prevented obama this senate arguably important white house 
the supreme court playing game politics making decisions based law people think way obviously lawyers stuff resolves lacks clear answer that's judicial philosophy important essentially inescapable thing fill gaps vague after fuck ass shit like due process even mean constitution full nothings get meaning defined judges applying personal beliefs always political literally back marbury madison case arose partisan court packing 
judges retiring time replaced someone agrees judicial philosophy norm 
chance make progress agendas the possibility change vs obstructed maybe biden obstruction https www vice com en us article agb sure sounds like joe would veto medicare president 
thanks agree downballot important lot said made sense there's accelerationist talk that good things get bad better rotten system allowed die also argument democrats elected progressive like ever fdr last one memory the dnc instead run moderates lost right seems keep running radical candidates well trumps odds reelection look decent if voting that's we'll right 
yep lifelong democrat would love see true get elected rather dino take 
asked say supposed know would happen 
unpopular opinion put girl judith sheindlin supreme court only judy judge 
yeah definitely wedge issue personally like lot people middle class specifics benefits done would make less taxes get much benefit sanders' plans in case government employee wages set legislation pay premiums lack deductible certain union employees way spend time negotiating new back years although i've talked that said biden says wanting sure high cost unlikely event moderate progressive democrats actually passed could two different things the truth senate moderate plan gotten almost certainly approve 
the problem see way thinking really take account current demographics country that would potentially good looking rd progressive moderate conservative but truth conservatives progressives moderates further electoral college set already skewed forced right represented so uphill battle it's much easier run radical candidate need convince many undecideds for every two three illustrative example numbers people talk accelerationism punishing coming left enough question always point likely go if voting shift stand can't far republicans think bernie great job something he change democratic platform biden definitely field saw look got policies dreamed years ago less paid family leave closing private prisons minimum wage etc could come issues like marijuana yes personally obama could gay rights thanks joe forcing we idea happen even fdr's campaign ran new deal lot supporters votes proof he's anything someone evolved become time one direction moved certain 
judith sheindlin hahahah i'm kind surprised reality star chief done 
yeah definitely wedge issue personally like lot people middle class specifics benefits done would make less taxes get much benefit sanders' plans that's wonderful rich assholes cadillac plan work pay peanuts but millions uninsured including girlfriend year old grad student way insurance if got seriously ill today cancer something debt life sure better saving bucks everyone else burn 
the way donald would get everyone america board something done 
honestly would take actually appointed 
that's really fair representation said first think public option gives access affordable healthcare anyone needs best secondly much middle class able service instead making twice private sector benefits like if pay taxes would make lot harder and people positions important teachers position public defenders these rich assholes forcing little benefit without compensation going impossible i'm six figures work community large group asked sacrifices getting ignored debate often it's vs poor 
yeah make figures either would also pay public option

sweet buttery biscuits let's hope enough sway people tomorrow 
really hope pete amy truly bury hatchet continue hate behind scenes 
kinda want see biden fundraiser that's fight pete amy gets binders throw give edge call chasten 
hi welcome europe so lets get sanders appeal democrats let alone country he nothing compromise work republicans needed legislation passed everything bernie says sounds great done becuase radical independants his policies hurt middle class small businesses scare investment biden building strong winning coalition leaves little room others pass purity tests 
exactly can't let happened repeated third party candidates nono high turnout key 
wonder bloomberg factor plays and warren hey remembered tulsi gabbard still running someone tell may forgotten since really come much news 
https www livenewsnow com american msnbc html 
that blows mind he really socialist social democrat get socialism spectrum however want model government nordic understand support highly regulated capitalism strong welfare state 
how work thought vote cast that's 
clears line election day lot people drive long skip there mildly interested voters wait hours republicans love lines elderly base nothing better people multiple jobs kids etc 
it means know guy talking 
glad waited would wasted vote 
read article can't find saying something south carolina biden voted bernie prefer medicare all it depends question worded like medicare see could jump immediately wants try so support candidates proposed graduated approach i've warren fan ya know also plus worked obamacare plan goes better personally easily voting even 
ha sweet buttery biscuits indeed 
dont think mutual amy hates pete 
bernie still formidable ground game we riding pretty high right think us know going drawn key make july blue no matter who even sanders making prime time convention speech 
it's policy nuance label democrats much smarter republicans except comes electoral strategy fucking stupid marketing you slap label deeply unpopular 
see https www detroitnews com story news politics michigan absentee voters spoil ballot get new one candidate drops similar states listed depends yet processed 
happy cake day marle don't pushed around fears mind be led dreams heart 
agree want single amy since trying unify

beto knew endorse biden veronica escobar earlier today 
the news keeps getting better 
hopefully push needed win tx confidently keep biden inching ca elsewhere 
this freaking huge texas beto country board lot people going follow 
where kamala harris maybe get maya rudolph show texas pretend endorsing joe 
recurring donation moved pete biden let's fucking 
very happy feeling abandoned another poster kindly explained beto also helping ballot candidates 
hope boost biden need get huge lead texas compensate bloomberg 
beto first choice way back already found joe great see endorsement 
so many endorsements today really hope reflect super tuesday 
by point thinking would sit primary this unexpected surprise 
this swayed away voting bernie tomorrow 
always loved beto he's going invaluable grassroots level 
he ned run texas senate thanks beto 
it's expected warren bloomberg endorse biden well right if that's case easy win 
it's super tuesday and i'm ready to vote for joe in texas and grab whataburger 
i'm tough time biden saying he'll beto take care gun problem originally started pushing control platform moved support buttigieg after pete dropped leaning now much never ever sanders trump as democrat also supports second amendment rights screwed if anti firearm rhetoric could get lot needs beat 
very close slight biden lead https projects fivethirtyeight com primary forecast texas according hopefully pushes towards clear win tomorrow 
actually think beat trump texas makes victory impossible would pretty crazy ramifications gop 
hope there's enough time see though 
rumor endorsing tomorrow since the big one obama he's made clear want seen influencing primary race since former presidents tradition endorse might wait morning dilute influence already huge crop endorsements 
means adding background checks beto said secs earlier 
hopefully pushes biden towards clear win tomorrow gotta hope good night 
trump still biden texas according rcp average that might seem like lot remember divisive president history lowest favorability ratings winning it red state becoming purple every election cycle and democrats legitimate shot flipping legislature win but gop definitely anxious happen 
actually think beat trump texas totally agree 
dunno make sense endorse night maximize amount people hear we're kinda biased around news endorsements literal minute come think folks follow closely go happen radio tv etc 
unless something changed beto's policy way beyond background checks he vocally proudly proclaimed hell yes i'm coming similar 
the thing that's without even campaigning spending serious resources state texans likes able touch politican biden's spends time actually treats like battleground definitely move needle and honestly right vp pick army volunteers behind hurt either 
but also good economy if god forbid something happens election think ec gains astonishing 
agree but think joe flip fl flipping almost much game changer tx if flips needs mi likely hang va nv narrow victory dems also head polls there's decent shot nc pa possibly even az even lost rustbelt except il mn guarantee win 
the important state georgia though it senate seats election need win least gonna flip if can't gop block everything lose house well 
true wish stacey would try senate 
so see someone added yang 
noo beto dont touch ur face 
fuck yea the yanggang thanks whoever creator poster 
resolution better need higher resolution 
y'all made obama look like mufasa lol 
form democrats primary pete stood already excited 
yang looks tad uncomfortable like underwear riding cannot readjust public booker action movie posture expression 
once warren gets onboard need add slogan dream big fuck hard win 
that guy bottom right hand face giving anxiety 
'we're getting band back together' 
you gonna need bigger picture soon many endorsers fit screen haha 
understand left politics different median position board but really want celebrate mike bloomberg's endorsement because whole existence election cycle demonstrative insane 
this thing cracks every time see 
joe gonna one helluva administration super stars galore 
be like pete arms awkwardly side 
that's honestly biggest issue saw yang version pop fb without totally shit resolution booker one went have to make sure reddit gets this 
expect big things pete near future ticks boxes 
my thoughts exactly lol and since asian guess get pass stereotyping hope 
booker looks like action movie character posture expression dating 
in time waiting endorsing works good enough 
really want celebrate mike bloomberg's endorsement the bernie talking point anything billionaire says bad one better ones existence class undoubtedly society individual billionaires fact people good points well bloomberg plenty politician person mayor nyc many supporters pretty much across political spectrum far i've seen align particular party his presidential run accounts failure saying support nudge joe's camp yes that's thing 
rooting bloomberg way especially appreciate think trying he sees rich guy get elected president via disinformation campaign thinks make convincing ad beat game win country back bankrolled multiple campaigns people feels money ultimately reason got slip th debate bought congressmen spending using power put positions authority speak trump quite clearly idealistic announced hired together nepotism ads kids release starts biden kid felt validated something good may important part yet play 
i'm celebrating mikes warchest media machine focused attacking trump 
yeah bonkers celebrate though get circumstance kind like tony stark everyone knows rich asshole know everyone hates also suit help destroy enemy 
he also donated million help get disenfranchised black folks registered november money good things 
he endorsed joe math became obvious would nominee 
he backed sanders never year 
like sir patrick stewart vs mayor pete buttigieg https www youtube com watch nbrqq pk feature youtu 
arms shown would holding gun us 
it's enough endorsed sanders either 
yeah sad always waits means nothing take stand foregone conclusion 
the problem bloomberg least opinion billionaire got far purely spending insane amount money money non candidate could possibly afford this demonstrates enough may possible buy election i'm sure agree bit undemocratic 
think means nothing her endorsement important party unification 
let woman use political capital however damn pleases never team warren run president could play handmaiden bernie biden owes nothing maybe holding endorsement good reason better timing get policy concessions seat table chill she already massive favor thank 
endorsement simple gesture behind scene generally would discussion negotiation winning campaign endorsement made imagine warren like joe's agreement adopting stances issues 
steyer better example talking bloomberg well known politician lots people appreciate moderate record the problem certain leftists demonize money act like possible good you might substitute 'homosexuals' 'jews' agenda rants pragmatists looking jesus politics get done purists for instance bernie tried compromise endorse hillary lost followers complained corrupt but way got things sanders wanted countries 
oh totally agree represents significant problem system needs fixed bloomberg certainly done even well without big bucks nonetheless actually appeal people i've seen mentioned bunch times recently sub think accept along everybody else that's uniting joe this time unity acceptance score settling 
and afaik refused back anyone he said he'd endorse someone backed ubi sure win nom 
she's also sitting senator midst virtually unprecedented public health crisis got way important shit going playing minor role waning stages primary 
she using capital poorly little dwindling fast wake pandemic endorses biden today team defeat trump implement competent government minimizes crises like so not saying owes anyone anything making bad political choice minimizes influence waits florida polling correct go joe say hey want give endorsement joes gonna smile gosh elizabeth two weeks ago really needed we wrapped longer need and ya know fit bernie might well file independent count chance senate majority leader window as argued free wants one agree but after georgia none look silly sidelines 
she might waiting bernie 'total' progressive wing endorsement shows solidarity among democrats ensures every knows leadership united warren solo sour sanders supporters view well prevents infighting left 
personally hope fighting corruption policies behind scenes of needed long term health america 
so true also power florida georgia primaries if polling correct next joe need endorsement moment would appreciate help 
are saying biden outmanouvre trump 
thanks reply with due respect idea best elizabeth warren neither you know really happening certain doubt political expert so people internet wildly speculating believe politics career she earned right whatever wants think agree smart woman make decisions benefits opinion 
and turns warren negotiating policy concessions bankruptcy laws so think did make mistake waiting endorse wait help fellow americans getting policies champions biden administration 
new biden ad negative ads help donald trump it's time bring party together 
the stuff bernie campaign saying via text messages absurd they say biden wants destroy social security make sure one healthcare totally dishonest glad calling 
as michelle obama said when go low high 
what great ad never forget thing occurring enough fighting back malarkey joe wiser seen playbook 
biden luxury go negative bernie it also smart hell attacking like crazy social security bad look 
smart ad targeting population votes spreading message unity trump 
great ad exactly needed right glad see ads coming money 
love ad message unity also sub my facebook newsfeed echo chamber angry berniebusters i've staying 
really like bernie honest used supporter but dismayed rhetoric also done little nothing put stop extremes base support it's one reasons super tuesday came could good conscience vote general need someone cool vitriol bring normalcy back country 
checked twitter bernie people definitely trying unite hellnojoe trending almost tweets folks talking cash shit biden 
he saw bs clinton caused large chunk population stay home vote stein you know tulsi gabbard going run fall 
this also handy ad manages sneakily remind everyone much joe winning i'm stealth play people vote whoever's lead demographic tbh like might feel good political strategy pov gotta respect 
the scary thing bernie's campaign attacks clintons recycled trump's he harm good repeating stump speech nafta ended making trump look smarter rust belt 
oh negative ad bernie's ads what bernie releases 
joe might running one first presidential campaigns completely honest truthful say guy who's 
gotta say best response problems brought ads he's trouble trump going hitting record way clinton needs decide respond dodging question saying even bringing biden's helping weak biggest reason support type makes less inclined change mind 
they basically turning left version trump 
and wtf bernie people getting everyone phone numbers texting is even legal 
this main reason bernie lost support years ago when started seemed running positive campaign among mess negativity toxicity lies probably paying less attention made lot incorrect predictions one prediction right sanders would figured combination democrats stronger alternatives time people waking fact honest man fighting working class everyone thought glad 
yeah sad unacceptable would thought better the worst try say things trump gop going go but completely unrealistic believe joe democratic candidates at least serve training ground general election 
biden wants destroy social security yang secretly trying social welfare think stuff projection actual socialists backing hope he'll socialist trojan horse 
can get specific example because i've seen saying he's supported called freezing cutting social security absolutely true healthcare plan maintains status quo significantly reform broken system see they're coming 
wow simply true where guys get getting texts bernie campaign left right it talks biden's record yes much good lot sucked crime bill social security etc 
then campaign guy belongs party wants cut social security https metrotimes com news hits archives new york times joe biden campaigned michigan republican ahead midterms seriously acceptable candidate things allowed discussed debates edit wonder far gets downvoted zero responses explaining ok look inward guys this come general 
when go low vote joe 
when brothers try draw circle exclude shall larger include 
biden pick duckworth vp kick crap trump pence go low https www youtube com watch irvuk i'd like think stone went kill franken's career gop scared female nominee picking he would destroyed debate ryan 
tbh think bernie getting desperate knows he's big trouble supporters slowly starting also figure 
lol just gotta find echo chamber 
they turned years ago we forgot 
yes they numbers public voter registration plus bernie supporters giving campaign friends info that pretty typical behavior 
when texted pete told tell people asked iirc lists came secretary state voter registration those considered public record even need politician running office check 
legal obnoxious family member received text message asking going vote bernie they said no immediate response why dialogue suspicious random phone number pushing conversation want it turned person completely 
no every campaign access information did get calls bloomberg 
hillary campaign like some bernie bros actually conservative plants designed make look bad sow toxicity however good managing he hires people vicious gets nasty accuses 'rigging' things pretty obvious moderates care looking recent paid advocates i'm struck slimy seem compare warren's similar politics 
bernie sanders done absolutely zero bring healthcare us while every rich country covered citizens joe fought public option renamed post offices the would already things bidens fewer bernies other countries ron pauls set back years 
biden specifically said protect social security bernie claiming cut discussed whether might past budget discussions he video shaun king posted full fraudulent saying not doctored say opposite his healthcare plan universal the people anything short nationalizing entire system bad it's true necessary cover everyone every rich country covers none expensive complicated offering 
this article disingenuous he campaigning anybody paid give speech economic club southwest michigan open th season mostly talked reclaiming american values briefly praised upton good guy work supporting cancer research funding actually joe best refuses demonize people calling culture belonging disagree things together advance important ideas benefit us 
is supposed bad look many people voting unifier work across aisle get things done instead promising unrealistic tribal apparently connection republican terrible thing days purity tests far edit why anybody worried coming general trump joe biden decided us party wants cut social security we cannot allow type working white house 
it come general though plenty us support individual republicans knowing perfectly align beliefs outside extremists common wish murkowski's less bernie's instance 
there compromise cutting medicare social security period that promise biden also know balanced budget bill talking it never mentioned https www congress gov th house joint resolution text even years ago impossible someone change political views time 
technically former pres could vp constitutional terrible idea though meant michelle cool 
think lot supporters know turnout issue problematic many also seem losing michigan would hard come back 
live alt right republicans nice friendly bubble relief real life 
my opponent released unfair characterization ad hey somebody's got fill airwaves bloomberg 
sure excuse biden trump pointing biden's record hurt turnout can't refute criticism 
lies ugliness still lies regardless benefits 
the constant false smear attacks we've dealt four years trump american people want another bernie 
is passionate politician bad strictly speaking say context describing when literally spread lies opponents toxic passion 
forgot bernie's campaign big sign friends contact 
see really big fan opinion 
right heck even want text someone voting lol we enough political adds tv youtube social networks lest message box safe 
get one call bloomberg bernie hand calling almost every day several months able pressure donating year ago finally blocked number also keep getting texts even told i'm interested no else called texted 
see bernie get text even democrat 
but provide direct example saying joe planning cutting social security he's called cuts past true it's one video countless videos need freeze social security public option universal healthcare bernie's plan directly based denmark sweden really complicated 
they ran ads joe biden touting bipartisan support speech that's campaigning he needs better do help opponents personally thought praise republican even though either purpose understand politics which 
do need republicans house less because looked guy said 
it simply fair say bernie got nothing accomplished years he get post office renamed https www sanders senate gov newsroom press releases applauds house vote renaming danville 
this inaccurate take generous joe campaigned saying wants cut programs year years it's recently became unpopular anymore that's fair game 
even years ago it impossible someone change political views time yeah really bothers joe attacks hear record gay rights well but care opinion held even current opinions people allowed grow hell that's exactly want country right why put come side history doesn't discourage others questions rhetorical aimed 
no vp must eligible president so aoc table obama bush clinton 
michelle i'm okay settle barack ruling america shadows 
think lot supporters know turnout issue problematic many also seem losing michigan would hard come back they're getting numbers expected all way april planning coasting convention several candidates fighting when biden pete amy joined forces effectively neutered sander's campaign strategy already figured youth going happen 
anyone permits trump stay office joe made political decisions dislike really long time ago probably worth spending convincing 
the self interest working people actual needs can't meet mile apart wealthy protecting money privilege know 
bernie consistent even goes hardest biden voting record establishment position nasty online shit 
mean agree theory got zero political candidates issue voter registrations handled state level all would biden pete refused use put massive probably insurmountable disadvantage it'd like running office refusing attend debate biased news channel principles you'd miss literally every everyone else still lose now are obligated opt request you absolutely tell contact remove list 
jeez can imagine getting call bernie his shouting would fuck speakers phone real bad 
like npr made mistake they followed across country continents 
he sending text messages saying week if us got one 
former republican presidential candidate joe walsh endorses biden 
love see high profile republicans obviously going sway people would support trump even shot someone erode centrist republicans torn 
really dislike walsh everyone ought oppose trump 
as much like see prominent republicans active opposition president remember joe wins they'll go back hating policies january th pm in way considered pro biden they're anti trump and even lot respect people bill kristol george will 
hey bernie bros bridge building looks like 
nice one year ago knowingly spewing birther garbage this another thanks biden camp 
we need republican endorsements get as many people possible validate think want vote trump 
he's kind insane not sure want endorsement 
okay ain't sharpie ing onto tshirt 
one endorsement could without walsh good guy right team accident 
joe walsh asshole supported ton horrible ideas bills congress but hates trump passion welcome aboard 
take vote point joe walsh piece shit heard radio yrs ago defending first amendment rights hate speech never arduously defend st unless involved white nationalists pos 
if anyone would like know joe walsh here's wikipedia page i'm going directly link weird statements he's made https en org wiki american politician controversial let's hope islamists next strike first behead appeasing cowards cnn msnbc etal refused show cartoons charlie hebdo shooting massacre twitter com walshfreedom status 
this endorsement celebrated it's cool maybe walsh really changed but still wouldnt wise tout one 
we need start movement republicans biden make america again 
strongly think get john kasich could help ohio 
it fine biden voters hate policies opinion if normal election cycle agree political lines changing win joe needs much support possible we big tent reason 
high turnout requires big tents 
honestly think makes important if allow former far right wingers coalition we're basically saying believe people change minds convinced it resigning eternal us vs gridlock in fact endorsements matter 
lmao one seem like others 
agree think campaign tout wanted post thought people would interested 
that could genuinely put utah play 
he endorsed hillary along bush's despite really liking much honestly surprised started damn well campaigning biden see two respecting personal level 
feel like possibility far guarantee holding hope guy grown integrity since 
romney already saw trump predicted damage done refused support hillary that said things changed even fairly recently impeachment covid crisis holy shit mitt good honorable courageous man happens conservative disagree anything anyway label book vote much actual endorsement biden would become legend reaching across isle this unlikely want allow consider disappointed late i'm excited 
that would make political year happened hope 
yes this election bigger single policy democracy ballot we need many allies possible demonstrate unequivocally nation reject trumpism 
lmao could add go joe united photoshop image we'd spend next four months like fuck guy recognize is republican that might 
take issue people only defend first amendment hate speech don tell political ideology 
yeah problem posted probably something people talk long 
utah play truly believe biden puts think candidates trump included fully realize yet whole theory finally get share third republican state country behind wyoming oklahoma yes ahead west virginia alabama partisan lean per morning consult via https fivethirtyeight com features states trump less popular sorry find page gone red every presidential election since barack obama lost romney en wikipedia org wiki united states mccain however became first candidate receive percent vote capturing hillary clinton since inauguration approval rating dropped elected including rust belt handed net points morningconsult tracking average for time majority utahns approve kutv news local utah voters president donald but polling conducted summer said utahn disapprove whopping saying strongly compared registered in mitt outspoken critic senate importantly democrat house ben mcadams th district includes densely populated areas salt lake city south valley now mcadam votes still managed unseat black mia love despite distancing member blue dog coalition moderate conservative dems he pro life came openly favor impeachment ukraine scandal which brings impeachment poll published december policy utahpolicy index php today policy utahns remain deeply divided concluded believed complete term congress investigate information enough evidence begin proceedings representing least inquiry next weeks legacy building convict sitting party senator welcomed back somewhat open arms approved gop disapproved deseret news hinckley institute politics www deseret mitt romney split hinckley ok lot good right maybe annoyed mean suddenly go they swallow morality right all convince flirting swing really convinced stumbled graphic wikipedia and important if compare michigan florida pennsylvania wisconsin texas north carolina swung furthest blue toss reddest see upload wikimedia commons presidential election results swing state svg it by fucking swing total speculation vp debate spoke personally abortion guided catholic faith also explained conviction adopts personal necessarily platform would pursue president clearly antithesis honest christianity wellness mormon community capital never backed political career helps john close given arizona fond view maybe purple year of course likelihood probably fall barring earthquakes one democratic give serious run money diamond joe

mitt kind backbone and gladly rescind words edit everyone like romney okay guy completely gloss horrendous votes taken repeatedly refuses admonish administration person constantly lauded integrity forgotten tried lie say obama call happened benghazi act terror bullied gay kid younger whatever terrible shit done glad see willing forget though do better 
utah could play conservative third party spoiler like mcmullen stars align it likely going trump though 
think romney actually endorsed hillary anti trump speech as bushs mostly quiet though bush said voted johnson something 
and fact matter joe even need really win state end needs keep trump focusing resources instead arizona ohio rust belt trumps joes biggest obstacle beating but get endorsements surrogates romney maybe mcmullin huntsman threat utah going blue force team turn attention if pull latino vote coalition greater think truly play the popularity mark kelly help mormon population convinced listen prominent political leaders becomes true may senate election on similar note an endorsement kasich 
he vote impeach trump supports ubi stimulus 
understand feeling way based things he's done past romney senator us history vote removal president party he totally spineless 
think he old clearly thinks trump danger country referenced vote convict joe worked together decades well 
eat words i've said romney years happens honestly he's satyr think could pull i'm pretty sure get reelected perpetuity day dies utah 
romney lack backbone guy he good true politician ton respect despite really agreeing policy wise 
provide shovel make easier eat 
what absurd thing say especially light recent votes 
utahns really like trump quite fond mitt evan mcmullin hrc combined points vote like trump's favorite utah regardless happens endorsement makes biden win possible imo mormons would likely decent amount go toward 
precisely have trump defend montana kansas utah georgia 
but also voted confirm supreme court justices appointed trump whole gaggle shit 
that one time dollar stimulus ubi 
like mitt romney he old guard republican one joe biden problem working 
we can't purity testing republicans 
he conservative vote confirm judges at point mitt never reconcile trump side gop impeachment romney also said president bernie warren know dropped either probably endorse biden 
character growth thing exists even republicans sometimes stars align 
yeah that's pretty significant difference but still surprising 
agreed i'm mass went college tuition free thanks 
actually kind left even compared old guard republicans he swung right campaigning get party nod president 
nice get decent vibe man 
went college family friend said he's legitimately good man 
one thing give joe credit he's demonstrated lifelong capacity grow evolve the today necessarily years ago that's good 
word biden great wingman obama going president our allies world delighted see familiar face person trust man word 
i'm curious hear biden supporters topic weed legalization seeing historically used war black community feel stance marijuana 
damn joe cool black man though she say 
so things joe done dont matter bc humility accept lowly position vp black man what measurable improve lives minorities is goal politicians simply segregationists anymore 
he picked help moderate vote nothing nothing less this post lacks fact 
that result good politician understands change afraid admit wrong long shown ability actually adapt 
biden wants decriminalize weed exspounge records related crimes get way states decide legalize his stance takes away alot criminal justice issues around to clarify black trying answer question adding context 
poc biden supporter whose top issue criminal justice reform people misunderstand overestimate role reach federal government first crucial understand majority incarcerated individuals imprisoned state likewise drug convictions country occur level while legalizing marijuana fine still illegal vast states the president power make legal kentucky example so people continue prosecuted possession given facts see measurable advantage legalization vs decriminalization supports legalization red meat left sure but also expends political capital unnecessarily given option eta word 
that's good question biden instrumental getting obama support gay marriage one first come got millions people health care helped get aca passed my insurance covers things like mental can't refused pre existing conditions meanwhile bernie opened post offices years congress work well others believe compromise reach black voters instead called establishment democrats he insulted democratic party seems uses prop commercial 
and takes absolutely nothing away point post 
not racist accomplishment in country full racists yes 
are black really arguing man one thinks beneficial race 
you clearly heard gop they're group congressmen women refused work obama even issues agreed they wanted deny political victories 
this important the ability say wrong necessary us grow human beings 
i'm progressive eventually want legalization okay states ones it come time harder take away but approach great stop gap meantime vast majority people get board 
actually federal law law land if congress passes legalizing weed nationwide states cannot overrule criminalize of course go far decriminalize give enough teeth legislation force comply 
thank if there's one thing need sub needless vaguebooking 
that true states ability pass stringent laws go beyond federal restrictions if talking constitutional right correct but proposed legislation recognized limitation https www google com amp cnbc house committee approves bill decriminalizing marijuana level html same goes pardoning expunging state convictions government power the president pardon comprises small minority 
did know black people positions authority growing teacher pastor boss white lose damn minds every single day defer person it takes conscious effort white unlearn fight back racism levels society 
joe asking special treatment person saying trust respects black people witnessed respect obamas do remember obama first state union congress members going crazy yelling liar blocking every piece legislation could reason they wanted accomplishments office angry man got it extremely upsetting 
think getting tenure important part academic 
congress passes law legalizing weed language protecting right usage states would go court voided specific part simply ignore federal law countermand states offer protections excess see also state fmla exceed cannot pass laws muster courts 
the op saying joe biden done past matter disagree see possibly opportunistic making terrible decisions negatively effect anything obama something offer turned bidens whole career around we thanking got free ride success indebted way 
if look link see congress even pass law legalizing leaving states saying nonstarter moreover go back original question seemed comparing biden stance bernie kind legislation probably recognizes decree presidential order would power suggesting 
my point treating people like individuals expected and actually racism alive well base condition country it takes hard conscious effort work entitled think special decency most treat doubly white black i'm sure realize abnormal man respect defer judgement man's that consciously chose ally eight years made impression voters laurie biden demonstrated exactly act nobody praising minimum stepped instead

you every person aboard matters that's makes coalition 
it also makes wonder much early voting actually hurt biden pete got pretty big chunks states would gone could done even better amazing 
jim clyburn saved democratic party thus entire country 
let's hand king maker clyburn embodiment 'giant' field politics activism

michigan governor gretchen whitmer endorsed joe biden ahead of her state's big primary 
winning michigan got whole heck lot easier 
this big fucking deal if joe wins michigan effectively end bernie campaign hope home state makes right decision 
no establishment deciding whatever called losing side joe endorsed running governor race on contrary sanders campaigned challenger abdul el sayed falsely accused campaign finance fraud guess he caught committing actual it's goodwill developed years helping 
this granholm's endorsement yesterday excellent news 
she's always favorite mine vp 
and whack job super mature rashida boo hillary tlaib slandered know michigan much smarter 
two michigan newspapers governor endorsed biden now question berniebros candidate better chance win 
question people mi would biden's vote nafta hurt still pool goodwill saving auto industry first years obama administration 
first jennifer granholm gretchen whitmer go get governors joe 
on day val demings and tammy duckworth 
joe biden much michigan auto industry recession he every months lending help teachers suppliers construction workers etc 
she said focus dinner table issues like bernie idiot 
if biden wins michigan missouri mississippi maybe even idaho next tuesday think sanders 
missouri mississippi seem solid biden what make idaho seems like washington states sanders take next tuesday 
how big influence whitmer is popular edit saw got asked already 
establishment boogieman word democratic party as former sanders supporter see everyone talking evil establishment really excusing bernie making political allies seeing people react klobuchar buttigieg dropping endorsing biden calling dnc conspiracy opened eyes many supporters seem naive reality 
when folks say the establishment think congressional black caucus defending voting rights act civil woman's right choose protecting marriage equality environment advancing franchise hear people rail see attacking things 
nice leaderboard repliesnice nice's lerobinbot porousasshole sixerspol nice am bot reply ignore and will stop replying to your comments 
and previous governor also endorsed biden 
the messaging really worked obama auto bailout hammer message home 
needs message auto bailout michigan time nafta hurts though year becomes bit less thing 
surprised people talking think perfect she loads experience will pretty much guarantee 'mum' vote and definitely help win back key battleground states michigan ohio etc 
think point momentum might sweep every state tuesday 
i'd shocked bernie take idaho the conservatism dominant noxious pushes liberals farther left since condition worsened boomers want pay taxes california washington oregon immigrated there's godamn bill table right eliminate property double sales 
even know he'll drag like 
bernie taken much latino vote strong hillary biden white working class away this helped win oklahoma maine there many heavy states left primary new mexico arizona means take like idaho north dakota tuesday last time the big prize obviously michigan due delegates 
and think hopeless week ago this amazing 
what worries though biden wins people going vote sanders switch 
biden every state starting mi 
you even mention florida one delegate rich states left calendar literally plausible bernie viable biden take every single that atrocious state's demographics 
looked according poll january approval rating low around disapproval lower well liked super disliked her higher older voters since joe shown he's done better turning think that's good sign source https www clickondetroit com news politics michigan gov whitmers takes slight drop 
well enough people respect whole campaign based fixing damn roads lot construction lately it help 
hopeful idaho pete big sold dems gala slated speak it still bernie country margins could narower 
yeah missouri good sanders lost much support wwc voters made inroads black that's ballgame 
idaho delegates not much prize compared others 
idaho north dakota swing biden gained hillary large chunk white working class vote bernie washington seems completely question us hopefully squeeze lead 
seeing people react klobuchar buttigieg dropping endorsing biden calling dnc conspiracy really opened eyes many sanders supporters seem naive political reality oh god friend cannot let go like unbelievable candidate repeatedly publicly criticized would see benefit throwing support behind strongest competitor without somehow twisting arm think description mindset motivation spot 
establishment akin deep state side 
yeah hear crying conspiracy aoc endorsed bernie plus sanders dc years registered democrat start would major influence shaping party establishment instead chose sit sidelines hope two candidates everyone cools gets behind whoever votes presumably joe helping trump get reelected focusing anger 
thank you in hillary rewarded lot endorsements she mentored many candidates showed events helped hook right consultants obama created amazing team world years there entire generation politicians campaign staff got start clinton mentee joe way he long time 
whoaaa didnt know voted abdul jumped bernie train big yikes 
the former governor endorsed made point bailout economic stimulus saving michigan 
also keep mind clinton never popular major candidate even ballot fiasco caused us moving primary early date barely got half vote race vs undecided so clinton's experience losing sanders unlikely repeated joe biden imho he's viewed far friend rust belt blue collar workers ever 
washington might doable rural moderate counties turn harder progressive youth seattle maybe flip 
idaho caucus state joe might decent shot winning switched primaries 
boomers migrating good biden anyway agree utah bellweather id mt wyoming 
note he's taken much young latino vote skews hard left in florida arizona hispanic population moderate conservative biden excels 
listing march th states the fl ga il oh az might literally end nomination process single day lol 
michigander people mostly upset able follow campaign promises almost entirely state legislature held republicans still using gerrymandered maps she wanted get road funding reform auto insurance stop pension tax stopping well 
her approval rating among general public really relevant net democrats https morningconsult com governor rankings 
idaho caucus though skewed hard sanders nd state next tuesday 
yeah bodes well morale lose single state 
nd caucus however likely sanders' advantage 
even dnc read democrats buttigieg wants good relationship put pressure that's evil conspiracy getting work party trade getting relief party's help things it's like candidates got alone working rather means support future political career back room deals arrangements basically seem amount normal give take within took family hostage unless dropped race 
the latest washington polls done south carolina think look even bernie prior lead evidence anything now biden coalition coalesced sanders could win warren threw supporters show democratic electorate voting ideology specific policy positions camps much who beat donald trump that overrides everything suspect likely lose support polling surging turn youth dominating among latinos narratives fallen flat this unprecedented american politics and course joe personality part swing due one party deep seated hatred incumbent president army wants war want mobilize quickly they bother contentious primary tuesday going another rout 
actually think bernie pretty vulnerable he took caucus state years ago washington also held non binding primary vote clinton the polling data available weeks bloomberg biden buttigieg klobuchar combined number poll versus warren 
dunno comes washington yeah significant black population lots college educated suburban wwc voters joe well tuesday hillary actually non binding primary held months caucus 
people forget hillary won wa primary issue dems used earlier caucus sanders allocate delegates got rid legislature moved date march so think biden pretty good chance winning 
isn't washington mail voting could like colorado utah lot vote happened south carolina surge 
i'm glad waited turn ballot going cross pete's name 
better shot anyways could see bernie outcome 
boomers migrating good biden the coming trumpsters 
yes even california biden beat bernie among old latino voters many latinos really empathise children immigrants experiences 
what stance letting mn annex isle royal 
hoosier love hope flip legislature we spend lot time michigan good plans 
bernankesbeard said https old reddit com joebiden comments fdv jy michigan governor gretchen whitmer endorsed joe fjkcjtn 
the polling data found idaho sanders dropouts endorsements https www realclearpolitics com epolls latest polls state looking good 
the whole concept give take behind scrnes discussions probably sound nefarious candidate campaign predicated liberal purity test 
it's called horse trading thing happens democracy folks like democratic values tend call normal healthy things conspiracies 
yeah voting also started two weeks ago us mail ballots count washington going strong biden 
hmm interesting didn't know thanks

seeing chasten night choked pete talking dad seeing pete's reaction joe compared beau honestly supporter turned bit 
genuinely touching feels good coalition 
second time he's made cry week guys this man magic first cnn town hall sc 
ugh it takes lot conjure tears eyes but whew man some really bright beautiful souls laid bare world yeah reminds supported pete i'm supporting joe genuine lovely people 
nice see parts make joe trump shining much 
watched sitting couch crying wait presidency kindness brought back white house 
pete lost father joe son teared watching come behind put hands shoulders fatherly way 
heres video https www cnn com politics beau biden pete buttigieg index html i'm not crying you're 
watching joe talk pete feels know made without crying 
does anybody link speech missed 
probably media rip biden say made deal put show but sold real emotion 
ever since pete dropped i've felt lost able bring take good look candidates yet skeptical biden start race after watching think understand joe bit better willing give chance above want see broken hurt nation find way begin heal saw pete's leadership thjnk 
am dreaming actually happening uncle joe taking pete wing 
oh god connected pete's dad said thinking pete looked little choked tonight would expected 
didn think could beat obama biden officially moving political relationship witnessed 
it looked like man pete choking behind biden saying whew that emotional 
his dad's name joseph buttigieg 
time cry gets vp position be focused stay strong pete 
still recovered pete getting choked iowa i'm equipped deal this 
same omg tears two days can't take anymore 
https facebook com story php fbid id rdr here ya go 
know biden well yet msm honestly believes still damn thing pete 
might actually surprised rip biden's around long time media know wears heart sleeve 
pete definitely seemed tears eyes joe spoke never expected see beautiful honest moment connected two people way needed ugliness current political landscape very glad got 
yeah father named joseph saying died right pete announced run 
imagine three together look saying shot magical democratic party past present future type moment die simply 
surprised know biden going say based reaction 
my husband hopeful pete get vp other nominees would need poc bring voters joe still minority think good chance 
ha ha right could still cry thinking iowa speech 
would feel really proud someone like pete secretary state representing us international stage 
yeah know part last january 
given genuine emotion seemed fact generally good showing would say definitely know similar pete hard show emotions able fake choke matter tried 
even prominent position admin like sec state would help bring pete national arena set success next presidential election joe said longer version speech see facebook page told wanted team dropped that's definitely signaling kind role very exciting 
especially since time yet gotten used idea pete getting choked chasten emotional times speeches point normally less visible expression emotion midspeech one hit like truck think exact moment switched i'm big supporter pete's would slay dragon with my fists if you asked 
lol crawl across broken glass sure ask twice 
did mean https imgur com ycva 
biden unveils extensive lgbtq plan drawing obama era achievements 
good the lgbt community needs lot anti discrimination protections this includes national work place housing adoption name biden best remaining candidate rights 
run blood bank the gay ban fucking stupid only based stigma point all units tested dozens diseases including hiv it needs go yesterday data settled desperate need donors country wide see stance work fda candidates said flatly end sits contrast hope joe gets better advice specific matter changes mind soon 
biden keeps going back obama get but also needs insert policy adding even rebrand messaging 
like even loved comprehensive lgbtq plans candidates if he's really trying make successor pete it'll pay start asking gay politician blood donation ban or perhaps expert opinions yield conclusion progressives science came anyways dumb homophobic 
wish team talked scientists fda writing plan the ban blood donation men sex needs change way laid good enough primarily continues suggest use year long period we known time hiv detected much earlier 
hope sign things come now biden secured spot coalition candidate needs start vision building compete sanders eventually trump built around american moral leadership particularly good plays strengths brand 
good hear excited speaking subject i'm bi biden 
does mean inching closer vpete 
can agree though probably policy best suited vp champion behalf think joe bigotry bone body guarantee flub sensitive wording subject 
gay man works leukemia lymphoma bone marrow transplant patients my need blood platelet transfusion well medications made using donated products there shortages especially critical it stupid unnecessarily cut portion population one historically charitable ways except 
could write campaign see can't get message 
agree principle seems working can't really complain 
think messaging works my parents politically involved hear obama get excited when see biden they guy who's promising rd term made vote tuesday 
im word obama biden democrat excites that said born raised city miami fl kids running screaming excitement joy elected 
somewhat disagree moment for whatever reason can't put finger biden's plan feels like non starter it instantly outdated matter somehow even actually resurrecting name obama however second chooses vp sound fine the biden harris buttigieg yang it's weird right 
this gripe especially iowa lot plans pretty big branding makes seem like status quo of course criticism mostly bad faith first place sticks presents 
yeah donation ban never made sense people diagnosed screened donate blood tested leading diagnosis people know yet 
it really needs woman preferably african american hopefully stacey abrams 
which exactly pete running mate i'd like female vice president first 
didn't repeal dadt obama he also pushed issue 
no he supported dadt alternative time outright banning lgbt people serving in today world seems cruel years ago best could allow gay service members continue context matters 
couldn't tell last time platelets medical approval now covid gonna even worse we standing edge cliff 
it's working primary think joe's got address stuff led us trump first place that's biggest worry candidacy how govern thinks aberration stand mcconnell 
the thing imho messaging works people like parents may limited appeal backed sanders warren 
on flip side though pointing fact got done obama years despite mitch mcconnell encourages joe get the senate going close either way we're peel gop votes passed via reconciliation budgets executive orders if take even one vote start unfucking courts well help lot we also bring things floor instead drag along 
as woman think pete one joe's best options minority and women love can't speak black community's views representation vp though 
my heart would love pete trying explicitly imply 
is opening blood donations gay people going change 
would guess could start website state campaign office that's even better they've really solid operation til 
stuff led us trump first place like specifically 
seems like we're seeing primaries sanders supporters make huge part electorate anyway focus getting apathetic vote worry much naive children's 
so mean minority within party if sanders warren supporters want sit vote trump retaliation go ahead live consequences well good got money like 
it appeal enough people general either 
feel like woman seems female vp would huge first step getting president one day also younger minority sort counter balance joe old white man ness since candidates men field could use diversity african american already love ticket awesome representation community he floated stacy abrams announced candidacy pretty sure 
agree think already well black community necessarily needs younger aa woman vp although would love female pete minority balance imo interestingly clyburn endorsement helped biden immensely sc grandson supporting good relationship chooses high member cabinet 
it key solving problem certainly going help but one best examples aftermath pulse nightclub shooting the latinx queer community targeted hundred killed wounded they needed blood members legally unnecessarily banned helping brothers sisters 
as far blood product availability yes more donors if covid gets really bad going put drag entire system people screened units tested 
having black president country full angry rednecks joe's already got half covered 
like systemic racism tolerance white supremacy economy toilet republican intractability regulatory capture corporate power oligarchy long list honestly trump symptom he show one day elected americans like if know problems trusted fix 
sooooo many people confuse medicare all universal health care articles come say good pros general uhc people japan quite evidence shows actually learn bernie specific plan favorability goes little luck using rotr meaningful discussions even got supporter think germany program 
reminder plenty ex sanders warren supporters civil think instead saying minority party better stress issues worked control congress we know joe white house going put plan forward however plenty minded democrats particular issue opportunity perhaps get vision passed one main talking points wants work back fulfilling constitutional role debating policy making law ever since lost gop obstructed everything obama attempted unfortunately lean imperial presidency thus hope rules views executive branch decide it way 
doubt smug election results fracturing democratic party long term republican control government or maybe comment indication person 
reason trump republican primary winner take instead proportional like democratic voting we'd dealing president rubio right 
it pretty clear warren supporters neither old white male candidates accomplish anything joe want bernie convince anyone work so home and seem smug assholes bernies bad tell knock fuck quick perusal sub today convinced belong honestly care they functionally identical just trump neither campaign inspires hope which good look going general 
go tell bernie supporters claiming vote trump sit get nomination voting joe want 
wow you joe biten supporter 
what makes think joe want change anything 
joe sign anything gets desk want pass progressive policies need flip senate 
want others stop marginalizing minority opinions primarily if views catered majority bother show everyone within party represented whoever enough votes behind ignore everyone else also flaunting privilege comments like live consequences pretty gross in event trump reelected doubt lucky 
think would like stop asshole hasn clear 
my comment serve mobilize people tossed void another years trump if comments like mine truly lost 
he seems quite invested online persona entrancing admit 
if comments like mine truly lost please read times stinks unearned arrogance why world would ever think divisive dismissive motivate anyone 
being tossed void republicans sufficient motivation if someone far gone communicate poverty may simply destiny point 
and there's enough ice cream everyone 
had cookie dough ice cream called florida 
ice cream everyone that socialism america get behind 
please hurry america may last long 
in honor last night make florida orange flavored ice cream 
love name account bernie would come join us 
bloomberg supporter we ready unite behind joe is chance gets vp 
stop commenting candidate vp certainty any comment like purely speculative probably heavily biased especially helpful 
definitely welcome anyways we love 
do think see bloomberg campaign trail joe 
many us ex bloomberg supporters welcome home 
really see he get biden voters probably already plus think would look kind shady considering money bloomberg going pump race 
not trying blunt highly unlikely 
think really see bloomberg campaign much basically solo super pac biden technically allowed communicate team happens 
as said last night biden owes black community unpayable debt resurgence they make woman vp several top cabinet positions filled talent 
think bloomberg wants vp beat trump imagine biden would try traditional balancing ticket he's nominee 
if places mike help get votes joe appear seems unlikely thing sure welcome massive field tv direct mail efforts promote democratic ticket platform all hands deck 
vp either black person mitt romney gonna lie 
bloomberg would valuable new york 
doubtful treasury secretary could mix 
who girl gave speech endorsing biden day 
think gonna stacey abrams vp 
can't imagine bloomberg wanting vp doesn't really seem like kind guy play nd fiddle someone else 
there way bloomberg get vp we would lose election 
although help bring votes new york 
not sure definitely one major ones guess maybe epa 
he get cabinet spot least 
imagine he's already promised klobuchar buttigieg vp 
that important job right definitely qualified 
no think it stacey abrams vo 
he would perfect secretary state 
he would know manage things 
we need rounded ticket my personal favorite susan rice 
think bloomberg nothing he'll get something kamala abrams we'll see likely role though imo 
if enough delegates play kingmaker could demand vp position that look likely though all money that's probably good cabinet post like treasury 
think management record propel sos 
biden likely pick someone much younger vp 
bloomberg proved man word today respect think biden would wise form immediate taskforce featuring all former candidates including harris klobuchar buttigieg booker etc examine bring life party enfranchise vote 
always love bloomberg record new york 
no sorry bloomberg old vp moreover need balance ticket probably capable black woman like kamala harris 
i'm pulling pete vp also completely understand someone like stacy abrams makes complete sense 
vp slot go someone younger opinion adding another white guy ticket adds nothing equation as others suggested thread epa nice place bloomberg work climate change 
think biden explicitly talked picking someone young vp 
bloomberg supporter well would good country private sector could vp hope biden young exciting 
doubt think anything brings ticket can't someone like tammi beto would make lot since 
think latino vp would move biden extract vote bernie give better option trump joe good chance 
bloomberg resources absolutely go negative ad campaign trump telling people vote democrats 
any particular reason made live thread it's pita moderate 
believe vp likely african american woman hispanic male 
glad right thing endorsed biden teampbj mvp 
he needs young counterpart offense bloomberg 
i'm thinking secretary treasury it's mike would want 
he's likely going pick someone color younger 
lol his money put good use though 
think stacey kamala booker pete 
think need progressive vp expand base 
imo booker best pick think likely kamala 
warren head ftc would amazing 
think needs female vp go haley trump blames pence coronavirus drops 
the ideal vp pick someone swing state progressive joe woman color tbh 
think tammy duckworth would awesome illinois exactly swing state 
it impossible think multiple reasons mike leader really good team member that okay also need leaders one president fear would undercut biden authority he bringing nothing electoral map yes well moderate republicans important thing turnout significant support swing states case on hand could lieberman mccain unpopular left hurt us help connections senate presiding therefore much get legislation done 
afraid bloomberg vp pick would cause problems solve perhaps appointment climate czar mike want needs someone broadens base 
black vote locked primary shows need someone midwest competitive oh wi mi 
yang bloomberg spots cabinet but yes midwestern ally preferably woman klobuchar 
love sherrod brown considered optics another white male ticket good 
think bloomberg would good vp biden needs someone younger could contrast klobuchar guess go box well 
the best candidates would pete trust affection biden sees future party showed iowa flip turn voters trump counties klobuchar she effective senator carry crucial midwest states duckworth just amazing 
new york's going blue matter vp 
would love pete vp im afraid lose joe general moderate republicans lack experience 
likely made supreme leader space force vp 
biden working warren election already that's staying hurt bernie return she'll get vp 
i'm sure brings table tho kamala diversity pete strong support white suburban voters went trump 
start pouring money adds biden stacey abrams effort register voters 
no vp pick political used order broaden candidates coalition bloomberg biden moderate dems independents former republicans want beat bernie trump buttigieg klobuchar also mostly needs running mate reach groups outside bet going women poc betting stacy abrams latinx individual maybe julian castro 
think nevada senator catherine cortez masto would awesome pick also former attorney general terms 
tell isnt bloomberg smurf account 
not full fledged supporter i've defending weeks now i'm happy we're biden train and it has no brakes 
absolutely chance vp the coalition welcomes resources funds simply cannot entertain idea bloomberg america spoken loudly expressed okay man buying way power regardless merit 
another good reason vote joe 
someone please put isolation chamber next year she good chance surviving covid gets infected 
going say thank god need law degree supreme court justice googled the founding fathers really overestimated us 
or judge jeanie woman judge trump list scotus 
why would replaced sarah palin 
sarah palin gets appointed scotus me atheist god heavenly father jesus holy spirit take home 
mean morbid even died today dems owed one merrick garland bullshit they would claim it's election year no justices confirmed filibuster nominee 
there formal law degrees time would awkward entry norm solidified constitution late th century practically one new country could meet 
they blocked nominee replace scalia 
think justices make whatever decisions best politicians sort happens they're smart major life around reading political tea leaves 
yes let get word really stake november think future supreme court issue bring progressives moderates together 
because donald trump idiot get two three judges 
technically right but memes exactly known grammatical correctness as long people know means it meme spread 
they would need control senate 
and even postgraduate law degrees became norm since wwii prior llb common 
she lol put selfish needs need many 
beyond scotus entire judicial branch us government trump flooded appellate courts uncompromising conservative justices 
yes either way point meme remind progressive really stake november we got time home message get 
it's great meme here's judges trump appointed th circuit one think sarah palin like which least qualified suspect answer ready google something maybe judge appointment rating find as february american bar association aba rated president trump's nominees of well seven nine individuals confirmed senate trainwreck there many reasons dislike appointments terrible also wtf no that's stupid conservatives saying hillary gets elected gonna obama supreme court edti typo 
yup they switched vote threshold break scotus filibusters confirmed gorsuch unfortunately harry reid started trend non judicial appointees 
that came joebiden to blame obama republicans 
exactly that way important individual policies president if progressives vote order bernie biden going end conservative judges long time message get 
no problem make better meme post one let get word progressives sit election bernie win nomination lose lot presidency 
tbf senate blue she could retired another judge would easily gotten confirmed 
like obama but mean blind follower willing overlook politician faults at end day politicians they gods lol 
tried explain hardcore bernie supporter recently understand scotus works at then like congress make abortion illegal anyway 
republicans werent crazy time though wasnt expected would hearings year election stuff 
ok meme meant spread word stake election memes capture entire story just social media it funny scary time 
my bad live long prosper 
there lot misinformation sorry say bernie supporters people claiming big source 
nation's largest union nea endorses biden president 
the workers spoken there shall malarkey 
say we need make happen save country let's go joe 
fuck yeah proud nea member fuck nra fuck bernie sanders biden wants people die support actually condemned children death soft stance guns 
i'm nea get say endorsed makes wonder makes decisions much merit really hold 
right when see neverbiden start wonder ever country save our concept tough 
we grew literally week super tuesday if new good company 
for https joebiden com empowerworkers as president biden check abuse corporate power labor hold executives personally accountable violations laws encourage incentivize unionization collective bargaining ensure workers treated dignity receive pay benefits workplace protections deserve 
favor biden like fuck bernie sanders this way top fair senator joe would approve 
reminder bernie's candidate wants take away health insurance 
please remember rules road subreddits adopted we democrats owe senator sanders much nothing else simply moving national discourse leftward perhaps human last tears joe biden's healthcare plan would considered moderate bernie his carbon education eight years ago ideas even table hesitant vote radical seemed president respect politician thank 
they surveyed workers listened said 
spiteful shortsighted opinion they using emotions make decisions rather logic politics game chess need consider mid end game opening if guy well throw next closest candidate guys policies chance winning at point biden sanders mathematically cannot win he wasting supporters money imo also working weaken best hope saving nation really cared country party would get put effort behind getting elected 
nah neither bernie biden blue trump never done anything government idea means public servant worry bit bernie's ideas tend divide people party think unintentional part dividing completely purpose we would well either president however like biden's approach lot foreign policy experience our relations messed mostly domestic guy fine need someone strong also going make measured changes build consensus within republicans much better chance 
right i'm years old proud obama biden democrat 
hey there's old people reddit 
something tells might encourage us going disagree joe hates malarkey much rest bernie full sorry really sick purity tests holier thou attitude supporters 
nah totally fair fuck bernie sanders 
bernie sanders handed us trump may it's rare candidate enough experience start job fully prepared day hillary joe tore one trying tear another just like last time chance winning st he's stay convention attempts encourage supporters vote november and his ego fuck he enemy democratic party deserves sympathy 
right sanders still make great progress senate we need continue support vision senators elected appointed 
odd position would actually super helpful personally insurance right substitute teacher employed contractor loophole offer my state expanded medicaid marketplace expensive but full time school district absolutely correct when para medical dental vision premiums fully subsidized paid little extra buy something like every paycheck unfortunately great cover spouse children subsidize dependent 
and replace something better your post entirely disingenuous silly nation would place medicare all fact people moderately less awful healthcare today mean work hard eliminate profit 
yeah reason gun exists take life away car that's hold manufacturers accountable 
if really cared country party would get put effort behind getting biden elected that's job bernie made case values around primary voters going push priority based polling his supporters ones want stay race expressly game 
year old hillarycrat joe biden 
got beat years younger voted joe 
agree lots bernie supporters divisive we trying build big tent party unity tearing gets us nowhere lets talk great candidate focus shortcomings biden specifically reach sanders primary appears winding 
make progress naming post offices he's completely useless he's damaging primary 
something better name his plan would fail hard practice 
really job getting stage running ads trying weaken biden campaign that bernie if negative pieces going throw support end day it's always come across underhanded 
nah fuck bernie sanders bust people actively facilitates by waiting months mathematically impossible win staying i've lost little respect 
think biden wins nomination democrats win house senate already shows compromise agrees sander proposals so sanders may good chance sponsor much needed changes country we agree better trump failures 
the current healthcare system failing hard practice 
yes and replacing something worse helpful 
if joe biden billboard would entire campaign 
that sounds like good spend bloomberg bucks 
lol asshole never save life 
btw stock market value points going day trump got inagurated 
another gem the coronavirus much control usa we contact everyone relevant countries cdc world health working hard smart stock market starting look good https twitter com realdonaldtrump status president donald trump february 
it's one banana michael could cost ten dollars 
the orange dumbass bragging day largest gain history two drops crickets fucking hell get sack shit office november let criminal prosecutions begin 
it antithesis expect love campaign joe even mention president think reason trump attention given if instead focus bettering lives left behind strategy 
love seeing examples stupid short sighted see also thinking safe defund disease control pandemics never happen 
disagree let trump idiocy hypocrisy speak people already know think biden appear presidential focused working people rather spending much time level 
generally would put none blame bad markets sitting president constantly brags uses indicator success also eat losses 
while stockmarket may great isnt policy implemented beginning fail complete incompetency 
can't wait asshole lose get eaten alive party 
trump needs attacked issues awful personality economy bad 
actually think effective covid gives excuse yeah market worldwide massive natural disaster remember covid good things going thanks instead tweets sound bites cronies minimizing pandemic calling liberal hoax way damning also pushing back idea economy amazing im expert seen single economic measure changed trajectory obama time office ps hell type simple typo nowhere near maybe voice text 
to fair market certainly recover degree election unless there's really worst case scenario we'll see happens 
not every word that ends in needs an apostrophe sometimes they are plural omfg 
what change nothing biden would done dick fix happened the government roll big carpets everyone get along poor planing anyone part fault person this happens rely problems 
yeah i'd rather bloomberg spend billion dollars help people ny going work two months 
well clearly listen president he's talking stupid liberal 
you are fuckt this new retirement plan came year how miss bigot keeping though say typed bigly autocorrected news 
if one way terrible personal finance joke 
see say trump hatred drove voters polls droves midterm 
are ks reason grocery stores id check lines 
in case market fluctuating due poor emergency response probably fair lay trump's feet 
this untrue he enacted crazy stimulus measures economic boom cut taxes companies allowing buy back stock something used illegal drove prices roof took emergency action kit goose markets raise approval rating near retirement boomers responsible climb crash 
this issues have seen market response trump badly bungling pandemic 
mean fair point made america's slow anemic poor response covid much separate contributing factor downturn also trump adminstrations economic policy vastly different obama administration ignoring ancillary things like healthcare climate change adminstration withdrew us tpp replaced nafta he's protectionist boo hiss trump partially repealed dodd frank act changes tax code engaged number disruptive trade wars 
most experts point expecting recession minimum 
firmly believe power individual society's succeed ones enable indiivual incentive ability engage economy better life trump's trade policy innefectiveness adminstration probably slowed stalled one america's best periods economic expansion we looking government fix problems incite wars cause reduce participate capitalism betterment provide basic services relieve acute suffering need oppurtunity minimum floor agree live pretty rock solid idea 
mean realistically could probably easily handle 
hate fucker much giving free rides coworkers needing one vote november 
we still hate stop talking believe 
of course going say trump fan scared biden sanders 
there lot come obviously agree emergency response administration poor especially beginning critical hour think deserve blame market would rough right even better with said thing going hurt closing stores canceling events good helps contain spread virus definitely great markets economy huge industries taking hit airlines tourism retail huge pieces spx did lack action probably sure quantify 
agree i'd phrase he's responsible bubble pop sound economic policy sought annual growth expense regulation 
sorry clear know policies different meant see measure economy gdp unemployment stock market etc looks like better place followed trajectory obama presidency and absolutely response terrible small part due elimination pandemic team intentional downplaying crisis hoax trump allies think pointing best way 
oh sure unless virus really lingering would think there's partial recovery november not every recession long term 
biden buffoon can't argue trump make case buffoonery times but horrible candidate he caricature politician would rather bernie white house joe 
think may taking comment negatively intended 
that's good critism agree also hopefully people biden avoid get dragged one things trump anything positive say stick nuts bolts poor pandemic response 
most likely sorry stressful week industry 
biden buffoon you heard first 
not gonna popular work trading firm software engineer 
that's super cool context would like outside really stressful moment

voted joe nc morning go 
get vote top biden sanders bloomberg warren dates mar spread comparing apples oranges https imgur com usmrt png fivethirtyeight north carolina projects fivethirtyeight polls president primary north carolina 
while important note democratic primary ballots cast poll fielded you're killing hope fix future primaries so many people wasted votes candidate dropped million dem could nearly half voted buttigieg klobuchar steyer withdrawals 
he needs run strong pockets alabama tn va nc ga hopefully bernie gets blunted california hold texas we need delegates votes complete case event brokered convention 
my wife voted early nc joe all way dj 
going big day let's knock bernie march th 
oh baby voted let go joe 
know nc looking margin could frankly favor sanders i'd consider major win he dominate delegates that much 
voted early biden stanly county nc catching ton flack berniebros trumptards 
did part early voting joe weeks ago 
now wonder kind excuse sanders going use loses majority votes 
voted joe california hurts see many people bernie bust every state carry load us go 
careful manage expectations this one poll 
and voted absentee europe joe 
wasn't joe narrowly trailing bernie nc days ago 
early voting allows people can't get polls day say also prevents polling stations overwhelmed especially states high population density great democracy 
brutal there better balance primaries 
this totally need ranked choice voting 
it's need ranked choice voting then someone drops people chose vote count 
trying objective candidate ends campaign endorses someone else almost feel like early vote totals fold endorsed mean that's what's going happen delegates anyway right same sanders warren drop endorse think lock it seems sensible option wasted votes 
it waste they voted wanted vote 
filled wa ballot pete my wife yet gonna go biden shoulda waited think would drop rd 
get people early vote first place vote time way know actually competing 
your mistake telling people gonna vote publicly info in reality among dems certainly majority 
yes the pollster biden sanders bloomberg threeway tie around days ago https imgur com plgt bi png other polls fivethirtyeight north carolina projects fivethirtyeight president primary north carolina 
yes one analysis saw said past week less really average shift biden we're expected win texas virginia nc and others go sanders recently edit that may st states 
i'm early voting think simple way account candidates dropping they ranked choice nevada caucus this top hit automatically realign nd third need unless misunderstanding something see like 
people vote candidates dropped get chance revote 
we need ranked choice voting it promotes cooperation puts hamper divisive extremism 
it seems like sensible option wasted votes most early would sanders biden warren bloomberg they're but there's definitely going sizable chunks went pete amy maybe steyer 
while may fine nd delegate vote since placed trust voted really fair st not everyone pete would want biden choice think ranked voting future or least ability cast early know states allow 
ly give award share report trying objective candidate ends campaign endorses someone else almost feel like early vote totals fold endorsed mean that's what's going happen delegates anyway right jesus christ wish wouldnt even trump white house case 
warren endorse sanders called liar national debate stage 
could get replacement ballot want turned pete 
do people vote whoever think win 
if we're talking electoral reform i'd like point person votes currently behind delegate count maybe that's also good area attack 
for primaries think standardizing works would good idea break states sets ten maybe randomly assigned cycle balanced delegate count primary days weeks apart after one week downtime debate two voting 
states let change early vote cases like many 
ranked choice voting actually slight bias towards extremism not bad system granted still none less personally prefer approval range centrists preference particular 
mean pete polling close nd rd states like virginia texas 
you likely right whole process seems pure theoretical if say klobuchar got vote utah biden neither get delegates yet votes go so different earns almost sure pledged convention anyway that hard time seeing difference totals going person endorsed 
not sure compute did ton gop people dropped endorse trump opponent think honestly remember 
mean point think warren could easily endorse biden he's actually know sane the popular bernie become unhinged sounded heck i've seen supporters recently encouraging use fascist policies complain trump employing since set precedent 
bloomberg's support tanked polls it also looks like biden picking undecideds this include pete klobuchar supporters since appear if look poll added feb vs one today sanders bloomberg warren 
generally yes it called something like front runner effect people vote winner regardless policy etc 
generally yes it called something like frontrunner effect people vote winner regardless policy etc 
yeah soon eliminate electoral college fix system till accurately reflects election works right 
all sound good for primaries want cut wasted votes guess states process change vote later nc sure works 
meant votes automatically transferred candidate one casted endorsed hillary would gained bernie sanders whereas tons supporters turned trump abstained voting given fact still popular vote even spite i'm fairly certain assured victory 
bloomberg temporary high numbers nobody knew anything anyone time nyc pretty awful 
bloomberg's support primarily ads really good one effect lot less effective though leading tuesday st saw amy warren biden bernie fact biden's ad like times hour compared 
till accurately reflects election works right no general winner take couple states the current democratic primary system democratic mean except superdelegates guess yeah soon eliminate electoral college fix think next implement ranked choice across board declare person votes end superdelegates definitely thing 
in order implement bernie's ambitious plans need win trump back senate it good meet somebody remembers congress thing and joe's proposals limit allowed with healthy democratic majority pass bold measures just joe propose mean he'll veto victory november means democracy start working members great coalition contributing suggesting debating deciding making progress together yes including warren sanders 
totally agree everything say pretty sad see warren drop if seen bit snl cold open worthwhile also think relative swing states south slowly driven republican party could happily vote biden sanders with nomination would probably find third stay home 
i'm pretty much boat it difficult decision respect bernie one president person needs get done faith bidens ability moderate progress bernies radical change 
warren voter biden this echoes lot thinking although experienced toxic sanders supporter face wary campaign time know nice ones wow it's hard forget kind vitriol aimed couple feet away also remember elected he'll actually liberal president ever measures 
never supported bernie think wants america succeed disagree way things the online support confusing it like supporter forgot civics class lack understanding government political parties actually work you can't cyber bullying senators swing state agree something constituents might supporters fine naive toxic homegrown russian influenced bullies 
the interesting thing biden's plans actually quite progressive there couple go far i'd like mainly things higher ed pretty hard read call moderate i'm uncomfortable bernard brethren co opted term exclude people incremental approach if never achieve anything making progress pedantic definition 
completely agree sanders supporters see they basically seem like opposite side coin trump 
this warren supporter nj resident primary one last calendar june opportunity vote long gone your comments online toxicity purity tests sanders supporters along i'm taking ball going home attitude bernie win putting that false equivalency joe different trump really turned campaign 
think bernie wants good things ego driven understand might one trying it's twitter trolls care people used close personal friends spewing hate anyone second coming jesus they always like they've fed rhetoric long become way life 
great points former pete voter although warren definitely align closer bernie biden politically can't get behind bernie's divisive tactics his everyone wrong compromise anything going give us years political garbage trump brought move country forward great ideas certainly ability unifying refuses letting internet tribe dirty work tearing opposition remaining silent impunity yang etc would never stood ever and part liked it's short sighted you simultaneously mock belittle people treat stupid agree yell immediately chosen candidate gone turns bullying agreeing more importantly handle end justifies means attitude justification things serious right angry spiteful no just but childishness maliciousness especially aimed good done nothing disagree reach goals the way supporters treating abhorrent huge turnoff she's much deserves better division name calling bring support campaign tolerate i'm sort proud democratic party candidates see putting past differences aside present unified front it become clear last two weeks grownups room vote 
also warren biden guy there organic contigent bernie's base completely toxic like month ago went comment section warren's instagram chock full snake emojis every post made that cannot all russian trolls the thing personally know lot bernie brothers months calling liz fake progressive dnc plant kinds crazy malarkey surrogates whether want admit encouraged incivility david sirota one people could imagine hiring head press dept you can't hire like campaign exclusivity expect win while veer bit closer issues really good he faced many challenges life much death family easily chosen stop public servant understandable reasons but continues inclusive listen engages supporters he's personable relatable would love see ticket think they'd make great allies compliment other's weaknesses well in event im happy majority us understand vision best matches biden's 
i'm disappointed number things bernie supporters done like black white thinking there room gray area that's government works it's incredibly divisive going heal division already progressive also understand my america always get everything want several areas willing compromise know some incredible superiority complex think moral high ground support politically as supporting sanders way care people 
they voted democrats past stated think sanders liberal common socialist saying comes mind liberals get bullet billionaires might first bernie's list people liquidate open hostility toward obamas bidens world genuine ideological rift 
are quite progressive cannot stand people assume means sanders second choice warren dropped for reasons state can't support beyond though right maybe internally feel like party left behind might look biden escape ramp gop would never twice sanders it's going take lot heal divide country think one politician alone know build coalition make attempt doubt even try 
totally agree well said warren second choice pete hate see gone race i've come biden best bet restoring sanity hope takes slightly progressive stances things input amy there's definitely balance struck anything actually accomplished 
summed feelings almost exactly bernie supporter back 
you hit nail head op and especially agree bernie supporters resembling trump now started smear campaign joe mental ability it gross laughable considering older heart attack clearly worse physical shape biden could developing dementia speak bern bros they remind starry eyed cultists lack realism current political climate chance get policies especially since know play well others liked after warren followers tuned good 
pete joe already caucused nevada those almost exact reasons went instead bernie dropped liz would made fantastic president she's done lot country treated campaign shameful hope see prominent part biden administration including vp 
liz first choice pete dropped yang cory now i'm left joe option value critical thinking skills ideology agree warren everything respected thought process due diligence forming opinions policy she goal oriented wants get things done help people bernie he seems follow whatever banal new age anti capitalist stance sake ideological purity especially science issues whether they're right wrong could picture letting marianne williamson serve surrogate talk health 
another warren voter agrees dislike bernie great hopes ideas darn sometimes seems almost self centered orange person know friend put well thought house fire we start argue remodel kitchen new window treatments want was joe said need restoration first revolution 
welcome thank perspective let get trump work together 
voted warren think sanders really decent guy many wonderful supporters but i've bad experiences folks progressive movement including also lot reservations camp particular disinterest coalition building open edit occasional sympathy illiberal regimes abroad etc can't get behind primary with race i'm biden got disagreements campaign best remaining vehicle persuading americans left 
same im disappointed biden nominee sanders supporters excited harass people online actually go vote soured well joe rogan ad regardless already voted super tuesday i'm waiting general election shit show in meantime want work anyone left get done 
thank support welcome let's take back white house together warren ran great campaign she want first pick would qualms allot voting general nominated and really damn shame ultimately sank cost complexity implementation 
you correct like bernie problem make smart choice every confidence biden beat trump 
another warren voter biden summarizes lot thoughts the things would add worry purity tests mean actually staffing sanders administration if true believers welcome really limits talent pool hate trump admin policies also way values loyalty qualifications experience political appointees we may kids cages still deeply fucked end joe rogan secretary state think bernie playing fire whipping people populist frenzy as seen online harassment either lacks willingness ability control supporters what going happen gets elected get bills congress subset followers convinced enacting matters life death anyone stands enemy traitor lens viewing manner tactics become justifiable including violence frightened virulent naive wield sort rhetoric contain negative consequences 
completely disagree number think vast majority dem toxicity online manufactured doubt really mean ones voting age americans mostly though agree wanted biden potus follow obama's second term still want next president if bernie happens upset us need try get independent left leaning friends board in likely scenario younger people excited joe clinton lost key states would voted trump feel strongly enough vote bernie's coalition young reliable win whole thing part necessary voter apathy kill hopefully comes something convincingly behind we high turnout 
as fellow warren supporter agree points at end day winning actually making progress 
skeptical expectation youth vote show tomorrow with coronavirus dangerous older folks biden showing heavy lead polls change bernie carries michigan similar hillary point hope case sure hate amd anger drives voter turnout supporters already said war 
biden supporter i'm confused video https www youtube com watch guzsof xlvu feature youtu true 
how https www google com amp nytimes us politics elizabeth warren bankruptcy plan biden html vox platform policy baccpa bill cnn repeal joe index cnbc unveils agenda targeting gq story 
sanders supporter also inner depedencies conspiracy theories video games serious distrust government voted tuesday outgrown lot social political immaturity but younger men cities glued computers drowning woes big percentage showing edit generally specifically us white middle class young afford ignore 
lets real biden supporters way going vote bernie nomination so there's expect is clear 
agree and think biden's long experience congress really help he's worked people time built lot trust 
argument someone claimed matter bernie lost house senate could entire agenda executive orders what solid plan 
going biden's website see proposals pretty pleased fact already active bills congress meanwhile bernie really thinks strong arm way presidency while still completely lackluster performance bode well office either 
my parents liked warren leaned biden mother said she'd vote trump sanders dad may leave president box blank they're lifelong moderate democrats 
sad see warren drop although saw writing wall awhile cold open great the little back stage dance fun although judging twitter comments video apparently allowed unless endorsing bernie 
yes i'd rather take moving needle forward issues care vs nothing worse backward trump wins 
when hyper aggressive bernie stan clue civics stopped supporting learned government works unrealistic ideas he's appealing people emotional level hoping bypass logistic issues 
i'm arguing guy right claiming obama progressive it's fucking infuriating bernie's rhetoric poisoned public discourse much trump's he also thinks bernie get entire agenda achieved executive orders 
i've noticed used consider progressive that's takes guess maybe i'm shrug 
there's actually differences policy wise biden bernie the big ones student loan forgiveness candidates going direction it's like wants medicare biden one bernie's people act keep tell can't survive status quo i'm vote sigh 
horseshoe theory https en wikipedia org wiki horseshoe 
yeah sad see bernie know especially polls biden win and honestly even mad could better get stuff passed reduced college min wage common sense foreign policy work 
yeah i've seen charts bandied comparing candidates trump misleading it's like might well republican which trump's way thinking 
bernie supporter warren decided run voted clinton general course even liked hillary beginning announced but like remember thinking saying pretty negative things it's kind amazing toxicity got realize dealing even generally decent people get sucked echo chamber sadly wish sanders campaign tried stop back at point much uphill battle 
yeah respect bernie sticking principles long even voted primary but something changed vote feels consequential expecting trump lose 
here keep seeing bernie supporters say can't control online think thinks respected hell pete's rules road that kind direction come top and make clear crap get banned groups happen nearly much when warren faltering dropped subreddit flooded desperate trying poach voters we even put stickie tell tolerated still happened meanwhile biden rep came sub said supporter tried send screenshot person would that's stuff yes angry want things change people but asshole support candidate convince 
work chicago area i'd say coworkers solid lifelong democrats couple pro bernie kind reasonable the rest think entire campaign radiates toxicity would rather vote anyone else 
yeah saw and yet demanding support if fake progressives supporting warren want take healthcare away children badly bernie entitled votes policy alone the best means nothing get trump elected i'd love biden ticket i'm sure would happen 
yes the whole care mean people online children dying lack healthcare thing really angers can't best policy means nothing trump wins 
yeah and problem you agree disagree policy soon start demonizing lose trump 
absolutely there comment going around twitter super tuesday traumatized greater lesser extent trump country need healing one replies stated nixon relief steady ordinary ford office that's thinking 
yeah i've seen if biden's doctors issues potentially president see issue either although maybe nd term cards depend 
pete joe when dropped two days virginia primary spent night going back forth weighing pros cons giving vote biden warren klobuchar racist cheater corporate rat smears bernie even consideration once saw buttigieg endorsing knew happening decision easy it boggles mind supporters treating way powerful potential ally if attacked relentlessly probably already would endorsed surprise needs time think all exceptionally smart hope gives cabinet position she'd stellar secretary treasury 
the thing every warren pete joe harris beto booker supporter ever met nothing warm feelings candidates my sanders irl friends hated everyone online respect across board supporters hating else like guy put giant pete sign office would gush it great camaraderie 
agree she's got lisa simpson hyper prepared vibe going nerdy woman love it would cool became vp convince ardent progressives already feel betrayed 
yes let's get shit done 
it's telling example politically motivated act terror left last years bernie supporter the guy shot steve scalise 
agree especially not bernie supporters way personally know several discuss policy disagreements without assholes still vote blue matter there's subset seems bonkers much certain trump 
some toxicity trolling yes in warren sub guy sending pms making nasty statements asking us support biden comment history clearly showed trumper but chunk come trolls lots people issues bernie supporter friends acquaintances person example agree statement though we need get young vote turn maybe vp pick prominent staff would help know answer exactly can't complacent like

independent voters voting democratic primary necessarily thing independent general election 
i'm already aware warren went biden bankruptcy bill thanks 
mean support candidate strongly online show vote really matters 
one always vote blue matter all bernie supporter friends i've talked person that mean like think issue beating trump whether that's biden ticket 
this comment embodies many rains op gave joining sanders campaign supporters small fraction democratic party you right dictate everyone else must kneel obey dear leader 
with due respect look forward seeing proven wrong also i'm sorry tulsi progressive 
mean welcome opinion polls low youth turnout say otherwise shrug facts matter 
fucking gabbard you give shit policy contrarian if mainstream media sanders pocket find another worship 
ah yes can do anything want theory donald trump school constitutional law 
yeah god forbid woman candidate chill moment she deserves laughs dammit 
warren thinks systems institutions therefore theory change far bernie they're ideological allies philosophically world's apart also understands politics works collaboration partnership i'm also begrudgingly biden hell bent getting democrats back power without ideas value respect much voting record real world experience i'd go facilitator listener good eq basic human decency collaborative positive spirit toxic divisive visionary day week 
really like medicare whatever someone wants label one health care system covers everyone efficient think biden knows can't accomplished permanently one presidential term he forward march feels inevitable decade bernie warren worry many people turned whoever democratic candidate attacks like say democrats need fall love republicans line 
i'm arguing guy right claiming obama progressive if admitted might notice biden moved left since claim 
progressives want us apparently we're warren democrats 
oh totally something really frustrating like disagree pathway end goal like why do you hate poor people don't want me to have health care clearly comes lack understanding opponents' positions they realize they're telling and yeah idea obliterating private health insurance fundamentally degree completely deal killing that's thing with everything else i'm page want people tell convincingly we're going get trying vote snake oil salesman 
say seems lot evidence supporting theory late seen many talking points pushed bernie supporters downright lies meaningless quotes without context seem straight donald 
think ultimately main deciding factor well able get things passed bernie going lot grief parts democratic party entire republican united consider socialism biden move majority could easily moderate republicans side this whole notion sanders would start revolution supporters calling representatives senators pressure support legislation nothing fantasy even rely consistently go vote 
completely agree also worded disagreement poorly talking regular jackasses meant death threats misogyny slurs the headline grabbers ones 
well see anger right post pretty sure complainer gonna sitout biden vs trump may even go vote thus verifying horseshoe theory 
sorry think original comment got deleted posted link different site fence wondering take criticism basically 
exactly pointed treating legislature optional exactly trump criticized awful precedent set got downvoted go figure thanks politics 
edward luce twitter in first sentence biden says something trump yet uttered first heart goes suffering coronavirus 
biden genuine human sense empathy that's rare politics 
before first choice candidates suspended shouting biden townhalls cnn showed compassion he lovely heart soul believe bernie vote 
honestly first time heard anyone acknowledge already died 
great opening question joe very good start debate 
luce financial times north american leader 
world vote joe biden joe biden adopt medicare for all 
way stay classy bro your boy needs drop people standing line hours speaking virus vote primary decided bs trump sized ego allow quit see 
want sane leader leftist revolutionary cannot get along party 
charlotte alter twitter anecdotally i'm hearing warren voters saying plan vote biden mistreatment bernie base big part calculation they use words like rude negative describe vibes coming camp 
while we're subject we tolerate they're if see one users treating warren supporters way please message mods 
hate standard bb response someone mean internet want people healthcare or something effect it shows they've learned nothing the messaging messenger important message this pete well future former republicans he could talk like enemy put forward progressive ideas way send running hills know guys saw democratic socialists america post dance mocking pete's exit race worried anymore they might able build movement they'll never together broad support need actually accomplish anything not unless stop treating mostly agree they're 
the bernie bros downright bullying abusive across spectrum of course going turn people frankly surprised warren stuck around th 
same they assholes politics stopped going checking religiously since of course but sure nasty trolls wishing harm people threatening vote trump bernie nomination stolen get frustration anger mistrust easily suggestible furious try point might bought conspiracy theory dunning kreuger etc it's raw unfocused populism and dangerous rooted good intentions governmental corruption bad wealth inequality etc laser like focus fucking intense mark 
summary tweet replies warren backers women absolutely describes i'll switching biden abuse i've deal like people telling i'm voting vagina bernie well theyre dumb useless fucks anyway and they hate poor people want to die hope rot quod erat demonstrandum 
the problem bernie's supporters view everything purely moral terms there room negotiation medicare disagreement whether program could adequately funded believe people deserve die because sanders speaks think when try describe hypothetically doubling federal budget time nationalize economy may fact create problems hear blasphemy god 
think people take much woe establishment figures like beto showed two years ago mayor pete never held federal office against me it's bro congress 
yup warren supporter i'd say i'm joe curious not bernie's base vicious rude believe he'd actually accomplish anything elected history congress demonstrates can't build coalition progressive ideas want fail bernie tainted forever but course get accused fake 
in words john legend some bernie supporters quite disservice candidate seems great human try drive people away nastiness 
how pete voters went instantly biden second said never mind way progressive cruel abusive homophobic describes vibes 
priors confirmed succs btfo malarkey get outta here jack 
lot sentiment ive seen bernie camp goddamn righteous dare criticize us oh see certain policies differently theres nooo way experiences similar not ppl used guy sheesh its undeniable especially man quell he loves victim 
warren supporter would vote biden sanders already voted there lot reasons and sure supporters appreciate constant implication always resented felt society tends view women candidates white left leaning actually present their polices meaningfully different just support policies mean choose for example want endorse think pressured comfortable public option eventually transforming aca universal coverage priorities prioritizes good government reform family leave concerned scraping new canadian style health care system like everyone else attitude empty anti elite rhetoric vilifying allies rejection party political process compromise america hell scape place deeply flawed needs structural many become leaves race toxic many core part traditional base democratic party older highly educated liberal democrats especially why automatically flock independent schtick light details 
definitely started bernie bros going harassing organizations endorsed candidates particular telling african american person still plantation also sending death threats even discord used participate politics discussions fans made feel uncomfortable like horrible voting candidate they social media trolls bullies downright abusive elizabeth warren supporters 
also love memes showing centrist establishment democrats lost as someone much lower support among democratic voters would better 
you know really like hear candidates current former say online abuse us hands bbs 
bernie also less support women general lot warren's supporters while almost bloomberg's go biden somewhat split sanders 
voter turnout bernie supporters super tuesday how hell expect win vote 
might camp well as young person bernies target demographic much abuse bernie bro online irl and nothing stop he keeps doubling saying need ever compromise expand base then conspiracy theory bs establishment screwing fewer people voted every day convos telling would without superdelegates believe show hillary got million votes vicious warren whenever meet high purity standards vitriol insane hope endorse let go joe kind compassionate experienced politician 
lol nobody decides theyr'e voting based internet comments bernie's base staffers who've spreading shit whole time 
so sanders supporter since although pretty warren curious back polling really high last year still like lot ideas seeing writing wall fine biden happily vote november anyways animosity bbs towards drives nuts long time it obstacle bernie many supporters especially online closed minded vicious all say hey guys maybe conspiring snake maybe wants president thinks good get downvoted oblivion inbox blows what fun trying explain super tuesday results yesterday even plurality convention would mean half party pick and group entitled whatever want conspiracy politics 
seeing warren folks social media upset bernie bros know going forward 
this excellent example bernie never expand base win nomination in response feedback toxicity campaign putting potential supporters toxic personal attacks 
you know would real funny warren talks bernie announces dropping endorse biden sure feels way attacks supporters camp hell even prominent surrogate ilhan omar blamed bernie's poor perfomance wtf are feeling bern much berning every bridge progressive allies like 
who ideal vp pick warren supporters 
bernie bros vibe check vibin 
meh actually vote cares but seriously correct 
okay yeah there's got kind internal memo something run gambit have gotten shit cite fact like supporters campaign ask proof deflection give shitty justification signed warren voter virginia who's ready volunteer joe who's endless supporting one candidate's suddenly either turned around said need unite triple vile things it's fun months 
know guys saw democratic socialists america post dance mocking pete's exit race worried anymore these bernie bots demonizing mayor pete amy beto expect supporters magically transform sanders endorsed many hateful divisive people like ilhan omar linda sarsour 
say there's lot orphaned former republicans southern states' suburbs included big part reason ga tx eventually go blue coming years people like biden pete easy transition party really expand electorate especially us want country normal meanwhile got guy who's acting obama career republican sellout fascists divisive person caused leave dems dodged huge bullet slowing likely stopping nomination 
this great response wonkette com https www well call grander sanders quote because sneer oh mean words matter people dying lack healthcare matters getting say 
don't forget important reason garbage argument joe supports public option extremely strong plan health care it's strawman 
and biden amy went way say republicans enemies need work together sanders supporter relentlessly criticized but that's win independents democrats suburban women value decency revolution 
exactly andrew yang put tweet minimally positive bloomberg thing every single candidate drops people treating sacrificed first born child there many replies calling traitor sell fake progressive etc if ganging yang crying loud one sweetest kindest politicians broad albeit small coalition asking lose election can't grasp think supposed work do guilt trip bully everybody submission ridiculous 
the messaging messenger important message it's funny used say hillary idea idol worse 
hate standard bb response someone mean internet want people healthcare or something effect imagine totally inept basic human interaction understanding social nature species genuinely pikachu shocked treating like shit today means tomorrow 
if said public forum i'd write check instantly 
leaving weekly contribution warren campaign active long wants added another biden today 
that sub big bernie circlejerk 
it's better engage smaller community 
you forgot always really trump supporter anyways 
with coronavirus around extremely ill advised literally vote one vagina impressive 
started warren mis pivoted then switched pete like podcasting saw performing now going joe said likely win year ago turns right this race messy complicated crazy cubs world series 
yes this analysis spot slightly different earlier today commented bernie supporter friend despite progressive huge fan aoc tried explain initially broad appeal lost lobbing insults people inflammatory example non democrat mother told respected liked grass roots movement progressivism dislikes rhetoric when explaining usually reasonable sort behavior makes like responded rather scathingly what values think lot well meaning supporters use perceived moral superiority excuse dismissive they candidates morally right whenever someone want vote dismiss person wrong it dangerous divisive way thinking 
it ironic purely moral thinking immoral 
not mention cancelling student loan debt making year colleges free everyone and transitioning away oil based economy how actual heck people believe usa became superpower we discovered used enhance american manufacturing if we're transition type actually fight climate change can't also doubling national budget and certainly remaining grandiose ideas sanders 
there psychological term moralization http exploringyourmind com type violence amp 
they confuse goals policies to goal you say support single payer they'll respond asking universal healthcare 
you alone completely agree warren supporter glad got vote my biggest pet peeve race assumption supporters naturally flow sanders already written volumes he independent light details that far idea represented think biden campaign run well people really know yet stands current policy proposals progressive hillary clinton proposing and platform obama hope gets message better fewer candidates his website worth checking it good obviously essentially blueprint movement moving forward 
i'm boat to see sanders blame supporters' behavior entirely russian bots debate turned along things stated while sticking warren drops vote voting biden 
warren least progressive bernie even he's socialist progressives want everyone able get medical care assumption among rich poor access hospitals once capitalism abolished longer given in cuba country considers model ideology go different facilities https www youtube com watch dnhgym bmta 
always seen warren supporters traditional progressive voting bloc dnc chunk bernie crowd new breed voters fit party well sense really care unity 
think spot is technocratic progressive term incremental change even rapid incremental almost always better complete start scratch 
affect choice nominee shouldn't make decision based way candidate behaves positions 
remember seeing pete rat posts spread like wildfire iowa and conspiracy somehow hand app glitching night heard since bernie primaries pre super tuesday but people asses hate idea basically right answers candidate different shade trump case 
speak corey booker stacey abrams biden needs charismatic pragmatic progressive backing love positivity well rounded talk ideas specifically identity politics universally approachable way as much important chose vp represents party better someone represent hopeful future this inspire country provide contrast trump pence ticket 
it's important point biden wants everyone healthcare sanders supports often gaslight part joe's campaign healthcare https joebiden com instead starting scratch getting rid private insurance plan build affordable care act giving americans choice reducing health care costs making system less complex navigate 
ugh yes even give examples get they bad apples fair judge supporters behavior or bernie's defense campaign sure bound shitty candidates typically see candidate keeping people check bernie especially noticeable 
wait omar sarsour hateful divisive 
yeah think north south split hold much longer midwest went trump last time bet georgia texas would flip dems bothered campaign 
thank they somehow believe bernie one healthcare plan 
us yang supporters searching new homes i've found mine little love bernie thugs 
the problem would get bunch death threats 
mean money used would go general fund help democrats get elected know happen sanders' socialist pizza parties 
love absolves bernie fanbase responsibility 
mean really they've misled believing literally difference trump republicans moderate democrats even though differences night day worse yet they've trained ignore deny evidence might show obvious going far making information age easy sharing already made false attack belittle anyone beholden personal ideology 
eh tactics different identity though 
forgot considered irrelevant there's plenty absolutely edit editing note see self clarification 
thought covid shown transferable via lungs 
it's disagree sentiments talks people bludgeons even mostly agree colleague new jersey like when told felt talked disrespected agreed said no uhhhh cannot tell someone feel aoc comes think might nyc culture abrasive offensive midwestern sensibilities makes go moralizing fellow liberals 
the awful things moralizers ridicule belittle try berate think behave like their goal make people feel ashamed guilty necessarily worried others moral values want narrative become law yes thank providing word this explains lot 
technocratic wonks like vague policies excessive moralizing show actual causes think sanders campaign poorly run filled yes persons believe hype 
well aware sanders positions like also referred blacks south carolina going biden establishment the apple fall far tree followers playing blame game divisive not interested part coalition trolls bullies 
these picks booker saw receiving support hopped warren biden would love see abrams vp 
it's incredibly stupid either view politics implementation voting working within existing expanded framework immediately want sick people die 
yep i'd maybe prefer single payer eventually pass congress i'll gladly take 
yeah i'm going keep beating dead horse drum lol happy community frontrunner fosters similar one warren pre brigading 
let's go route disparagement this specifically unfounded claim likely started none donald trump 
know sarsour's ties farrakhan refusal denounce omar's generally littered conteoversies that's 
same these berners real people irl russian bots constantly called yang conman us yanggang morons getting suckered yang's speeches then follow endorsebernieplease jesus man the bernie campaign theirselves 
please see comment they called trump republican 
no the bbs actually said when going vote bernie treated pete called trump republican 
so would voted biden fewer toxic supporters anyways my comment aimed 
i'd prefer single payer healthcare mess country scrapping starting incredibly likely leave us nothing something better with incrementalism joe evolve nhs tier system 
could imagine going warren dms five minutes you would lose faith humanity 
sorry failed make context clear original comment 
so support bernie trump supporter almost every american sounds like clinton right said nobody likes bros 
sorry misunderstood thought saying bb trump supporters haha but yes pete warren donor supporter last year made impossible see joining berner movement too many toxic jerks put rest us places closet republicans russian shills 
yes voted regardless but every voter like some looking belong want part something feel inspired candidate so bernie supporters trolling attacking people turns it realistic expect ignore focus issues the toxic divisive environment america right due trump get away 
heard first folks pretty much every st state california colorado vermont trump voters jesus ridiculous 
ok my point can't sympathize ignoring candidate focus community voting 
first time life voted democratic primary mo joe 
voted joe stl let's go mo 
was hoping missouri thread first time https imgur com ubmyzsc glad build joementum 
you go mo fo joe hoe 
hopefully last time voting dem primary 
thanks virginia may state lopsided mine signed another guy looking replace one fake savior 
out curiosity busy curious coronavirus fears would keep people going polling locations 
awesome and good voting primary regardless voted every american exercising right vote 
sorry rain parade but really curious european why dont guys want free healthcare what's 
voted republican primary democrat general this time around times 
you've seen joementum get ready 
polls opened third line but saw people walking pulling leaving 
bernie underperformed every state even losing several states expected win biden along working class people minorities northern white affluent suburbia increased voter participation went larger gains support tanked since this myth able draw voters usually engaged destroyed one week ago holding nothing better pair tens called party point trump republicans encouraging vote know easy gop ballot 
because taking care fellow citizens american that european thing here take 
american want free healthcare would really like answer question well 
love democrats fact every four years anarchist stand shoulder political equivalent cream oreo find common ground i've always looked pragmatic candidates reason it's want my way win wanted seat table that's joe saying we building bridges 
republicans shamelessly rigging process bernie 
welcome so glad we're binging new people out curiosity got vote and pushed away trump 
exact situation and mo well voting biden today never felt good 
it wasnt busy remotely went didnt even wait line 
want free healthcare however believe bernie's ability deliver primary issue voting 
it would great joe could adopt pete's policy decriminalizing drugs sounds radical first makes lot sense 
guess missed part clearly stated last year voted republican primary democrat general lol 
hilary and trump trump pushed away 
surely though bernie saying hes going try better biden trying 
disagree i'd like see fleshed plan greater public voice regulate test price drugs together think quite possible slide comprehensive get pharma industry back line human needs destroying large not need look psychedelics mental health ketamine working amazingly well acute suicidal ideation but also insulin hiv medications figure make widely distributed low cost we looking impressive leaps locally driven care neighborhood nurses turning outcomes around rd world countries if works it'll stunningly good us states putting people would sah work including prescribing risk meds it's big huge ideas push narrative 
meant republican primary totally get point trump 
no if either way i'm going get free healthcare election cycle important priorities like winning november want trump white house believe joe biden best chance he broad support bernie lacks cannot win without promised revolution huge voter turnout materialized one actually motivated supporters show 
interesting opinion great thanks explaining 
ill agree sanders getting people show biden really either it's us allow another trump presidency 
she needs time take deep breath seeing 
like labeled biden even though image 
we never thought warren snake she true progressive race sleep better night knowing watching financial system 
would've liked voted warren i'll happy hell forces biden support reversing stance creditors biggest mistake he's made career imo 
you guys amazing truly appreciated 
sanders one betrayed warren he exactly friend managed alienate person supporters it sided friends 
let goooo biden let try winning bernie bringing home november 
need help meme bots prep firehose 
pete's progressive went ton peoples heads reason 
harris castro booker progressive even think biden buttigieg progressives you'd go people like delaney bullock bennet start finding actual moderates hate true thing you left every issue warren populist she also pragmatic snake 
joe would progressive basically every issue president we've ever qualify 
please explain sanders true progressive 
agree delaware you could argue supporting constituents 
yes people age well done biden viewed great president built phenomenal coalition anti trump republicans independents moderate democrats cheers 
we slowly learning biden bros made first meme year 
this actually really well done make like two memes month never clean job edit 
if sound nice allowed revolutionary like rule more seriously pete progressive outright extreme plans race scotus justices electing he's better explaining without making feel going burn house things go way and honestly want speak that's skill lot gay people know learned survival you learn agreeable authentic still sounding 
it rule modern american politics you put together clean cut well spoken make valid points preach inclusion and progressive duh 
exactly joe also gotten treatment others his policies progressive people give credit 
because movement actually true progressive understands compromise humility 
it's okay represent constituents agree 
like argument people defended bernie's shitty gun votes i'll take overwhelming good biden's done tiny bit bad i'd prefer reverse stance also delaware needs change damn laws corporate tax shelter reigned federal government that's different discussion entirely oh another thing https mobile twitter com njgov status 
exactly btw trump president if look back confusion believe 
cool yeah need biden bros much healthier attitude 
yet lates bernie bros meme perfect and thank much 
well man least i'd say warren things people understood progressive 
because https imgur com dlpszlx jpg you obviously tried figure and said cant get youre promising done multiplying wait mean come progress name win 
like said agree but support state's biggest industry doubt would senator long more political reality anything 
delaware small state really two industries employ people chemicals banking anyone representing came hard credit card co's would ass recall election 
fair point but say admirer someone would likely vote one day gives middle school substitute teacher vibes 
there nothing humble staying race mathematically eliminated compromising man stubborn get legislation passed like minded progressive barney frank said one could work and compiled personality cult base adores doesnt even seem self aware much time seriously read sentence politician america okay donald trump best people think 
not stripping people bankruptcy protection absolutely coming hard cc companies and think biden incumbent since would've faced significant backlash supporting one bill 
his logic protect lower income families gouged higher interest rates loans lenders bankruptcy protections make business riskier

your support matters warren far left but think lot important plans biden lacks particularly believe firmly co termination solution disconnect corporate boards company best interests ecstatic entered campaign everyone read learn 
bernie supporter really hope biden fend ukraine smears coming way end day want trump gone 
warren supporters key winning senate back imo the blue wave fueled flipping traditionally red suburban districts soccer moms think astute voters might really hope jump help kick mitch amy army member 
from one former warren fan another welcome team joe support many reasons people nothing kind welcoming 
hello fellow warren supporter hope find sub welcoming good natured 
welcome glad bet liz great plan end malarkey 
you seeing lot things many rest us op love elizabeth ideal world would nominee real joe happy fight alongside 
like ideas greatly discounted even free college idea reformed health care other nations but doubtful bernie able get anything passed there's evidence yet majority kind congress close that's probably would take he's seen far left number one priority beating trump think socialist label fox republicans drilling voters minds keep winning in usa going win we've yelling russia past years especially democrats candidate labeled average understand democratic they hear fdr he'll spend time debates repeatedly explaining difference sink 
welcome aboard supported warren january february defected juli castro due concerns electability back september november biden opaque responses vis medicare lack detailed plans foreign policy contrasted joe straightfoward approach inspirational rhetoric america supposed candidate stage said anything like lot policies think would better commander chief reasons mentioned uniquely great issues hope influential role administration continued sucessful senate career 
this day sucks i'm sorry joe first choice either imagine president biden signing one warren's signature pieces legislation or warren taking accepting vp spot 
hi from team pete member lucky senator lets go win thing 
welcome came team pete found new home never lose love liz make sure gets lived joe's campaign 
welcome teampete turned teamjoe floridian 
really hope pressure joe taking zoning housing infrastructure anti corruption initiatives she close number reasons 
start joe either but want work institutions maybe even make better nothing's getting senate mcconnell leader nobody good replace rbg trump stays office the path demoting runs biden sanders we talk specific legislation later we've taken first step 
another warren voter supporting joe let's win november 
welcome biden bidet no malarkey allowed let's get aboard hype train woo lol remember biden diddle kids 
joe fought segregation bernie how hypocritical 
as cliche saying ever goes definition insanity repeating actions expecting different results sadly exactly biden's ideas policy positions promise understand change uncomfortable appear idealistic but persistent tired attempts convinced enough american public believe ing people he who must not be named lease worth shot please beg open eyes see lifetime moment upon us realize joe biden perpetuate sad state affairs profited bringing desperate set circumstances or else get ready don jr 
the bernie vs biden polls fl tells us need know 
florida would landslide trump sanders ticket probably lose house seats flipped fl 
how many people think genuinely always supported joe plans face value 
hopefully gop cried wolf many times benghazi emails public buy time and unfortunate factor biden hurt sexism candidacy like clinton 
ugh right media they can't help repeat every stupid thing trump says megaphone generates clicks makes money he look bad enough hope joe focuses positive vision america instead 
thank either at certain points already campaign joe said things issues actually made pretty upset but super tuesday results rolled thought support next peace washed knew one end long national nightmare 
another pete supporter chiming really respect biden campaign given lip service amy beto campaigns since super tuesday endorsements give thanks fish statement i've seen multiple acknowledgements victories messages tells wants lead team megalomaniac gives hope best candidates' ideas find home uncle joe 
thank and imagine there malarkey anymore becomes majority leader 
wheeeeee liz would school old boys something fiersome 
find neither point surprising thank 
thank that another thing believe joe listen he shown far capacity bernie 
thanks upfront think several reasons gop cried wolf many times clinton benghazi emails not sure voters buy time house power investigate trump kids response that might make senate twice sexism played huge role way investigations conducted covered biden subject 
welcome i'm worried ukraine thing it's beaten death already think gain traction among voters 
hi it sparked good discussion let keep fighting big structural change 
biden signing warren's bankruptcy law reform bill would poetry you could make hbo series couple decades 
me urban planning masters candidate 
voted bernie oregon primary don fucking tell set progressive cause back decades continues refuse work people listen reach drive voter turnout biden wants public option warren floated stepped approach even aoc said settle get votes and think sanders proved willingness majority black voters he talk clyburn go selma articulate plans specifically address structural racism listening however that big part shifting 
this may shock people change the overwhelming majority black voters know years ago support seen 
it seems like committed looking things matters perspective whole massive host people pick candidates based policy checklist ton factors tangible intangible biden fighting sexism decades right wing conspiracy theories nomination clinton good better sanders attracting white working class voters cause especially union midwest that huge difference trump known commodity consistently low approval ratings rather plucky outsider upstart might new ideas change circumstances he shown great deal country completely incompetent fucked farmers folks obamacare many others bernie content throw giant states florida away castro comments ignore central pillars black community south carolina alabama mississippi need turn november beat graham hyde smith elect jones revolution terms but building big enough coalition get young disaffected goddamn polls numbers win carried handily years ago political comes campaign supporters noses work perceive court even slightly impure however define so wins going hard see anything done congress office the electorate different political climate power structure widespread public perception two stick head outside echo chamber listen value think may surprised world bigger place thus far 
read post comment history either stock tinfoil hat 
and pa an anti fracking stance state's largest industry 
also think least last time media kept cycling hmm daily new atrocious stupid thing trump said ok balanced say something bad hillary mention emails guess and effect voters thinking i've heard things can't remember well but whole lot must really bad 
used ambivalent also team warren watching videos past days comforting meghan mccain father's cancer diagnosis i'd really proud candidate he's compassionate empathetic almost politician think he'll draw stark contrast bully office the country needs comfort stability trump make progress issues well 
flitted several candidates including warren ended joe older relatives types paying attention he quite legitimately good policies twitter snarkers tend overlook surprisingly progressive if interested read plans hbcus wants implement bobby scott's safe act even expand another thing make feel hold grudges he's willing build coalitions listen people admit fucked know beefs past allegedly wish could find link back thinking running asked meeting approached ideas offered vp so shocked listened seriously olive branch sort cabinet position although want senate majority leader fuck schumer i'm sure aware may check gwen moore i've seen connected political floating around name along val demings possible picks like late voters warren's camp would happy probably fine center left fl politicians 
take heart fact historically progressive policies typically get enacted establishment figure helped pushed grassroots swell momentum when we've best work concert give biden senate majority back make sure uses 
going speak behalf like joe listen people agree certain issues include policy making process think biden policies perfect but confident work breadth party reach point vast majority moderate liberal leftist satisfied platform confidence sanders consensus within 
believe look posting comment history bernie build coalition inability reach clyburn show bloody sunday selma turn young voters enough numbers support revolution give great pause warren supporter believes wholeheartedly need move toward thought stepped approach starting public option ideal as opposed wave magic wand at least biden wants they agreed front and knows things work executive legislative branches government it position take without reservations th choice field but highest ranked still running vote smile face may november 
hi conservative biden pete specifically sanders he far and know one seen others like 
personally seen moderate democrats say they'll stay home vote trump bernie although i've heard lot supporters think moderates rightly worried grab enough independents republicans win swing states bernie's path would energizing base young voters love voter turnout increased we're seeing far primary whereas joe increasing many when asked recently expand suburban said that kind attitude worrying 
the day pete dropped sub doubled size significant chunk refugees pete's 
another warren supporter i'll knocking doors biden come fall agree want warren's policies passed makes sense happen presidency 
agree listening ridiculously rated skill set 
hope right millions people believe hillary ran pedo ring basement restaurant didnt even made wildest things 
what well reasoned thorough response glad team joe 
shouldn't anti fracking given horrible environment hopefully next president look transition workers different field 
yeah think significant number trump supporters feel guilty supporting someone immoral puts something saying candidate corrupt even plausible gives cover they well wash one i'm allowed vote single issue matters tax cuts conservative judges whatever 
joe biden knows like kids deployed combat zone he grow middle class physical disability relentlessly mocked and sadly also bury children life dealt shitty hand several points much would break lesser man instead poured grief frustration helping people this infuriates say inspire when watch talk first wife daughter son beau parents raised inspires try better of course angry old moments everyone gets really passionate things but career helped else field combined legislatively violence against women act personally gives personal phone number kid stutter call he's feeling needs little help i'm knocking candidates trying explain is inspiring least way none others told boring mind numbingly irritating 
bernie build coalition inability reach clyburn show bloody sunday selma turn young voters enough numbers support revolution give great pause if supporters want one sentence reason right pretty much 
read my post history believe biden effective getting half want done public option bernie 
sure we renewable energy releasing greenhouse gases we're even close yet if like low gas prices least little ok we've become world's leading supplier natural fighting wars oil past two decades fracking put lot pennsylvanians work vote 
he knows like kids deployed combat yet man voted favour iraq war therefore directly responsible deaths thousands innocent people literal blood hands honestly cannot understand let stuff slide easily it nothing short disgusting biden losing son tragedy genuinely feel great sympathy however literally faced exactly fate war yet brown far away seem care that infuriating 
nope but coincidentally biden also endorsed conor lamb pa rep ran specifically strengthening background checks instead introducing new gun laws that phenomenon magic he unite pro politicians anti find solution together exactly type collaboration unity party needs issue many others also implication liberal conservative voters option primary running free college socialized medicine stringent control ridiculous 
the sanders theory politics shown work he cannot deliver youth turnout claims biden moderate suburban rural voters he's talked that makes electable one imo 
like low gas prices hate destruction environment far 
beau went war dad voted 
here's funny thing think sanders could made work built inclusive culture rather divisive one one pod save america guys great point paraphrasing said if supporters spend entire campaign calling candidates rat fuck snake traitor surprised gravitate revolution candidate drops 
it exact kind willfully ignorant everything understand stupid condescending judgmental posturing keeping bernie campaign growing base drawing coalition needed govern far seen supporters characterize black voters low information dismissive case particularly racist logic may feel good masturbatory form self congratulation effective way martial support run democracy full people believe different things believing right enough building achieve every bit important and huge part willingness let perfect enemy then stay fight next opportunity 
i'm hear respect industry going speak blue collar workers coal country where biden is from always vote keep jobs 
conor lamb currently represents pa pittsburgh suburbs however first election old formerly held tim murphy https en wikipedia org wiki american politician republican scroll electoral history section article routinely district double digits it solid he winning voters democrats need win biden receiving endorsement signal confidence ability know made rising star good enough speak every concern gun control policy all say man listen variety opinions interest groups going people like beto undertake mind that even pro liberals hope respect feel differently issue deserve interests represented well 
exactly but i'd argue populist campaign inevitably results sort toxicity populism part problem sanders enough understand counter effect first running now control attempts put lid little late edit act like consolidation moderates coup marrianne williamson said plot dnc instead legitimate exercise ideological unification sow ground it's somewhat trumpian blast organized resistance illegitimate immoral dangerous people demanding absolute fealty allies and ally step line disagree branded traitorous snake rat etc enemy

taxes that's trump needs win he'll say bernie coming paycheck government take away rights then end just taxes 
nope dime thus far we may fools we're winning 
the dems done anything progressives coming together called tactics bernie people known ready changed message much broader friendlier order gain followers access warren's total voters they liar supporters attacking that's failure complete utter lost command joe played well smooth used solid mental capabilities put group moderates it's smart play succeeded i'm sorry got hurt process that's politics kinda thing we're going need fight republicans so bit forgiving kind honey unlock many doors vinegar 
it also help complain candidate ally blame loss may suffer possibly alienating voters might agree 
actually castro cool things he really good jailing political dissidents world class even 
like guys thing accusing bernie supporters 
some seem think glad biden adopted pete rules road 
is late earn sweet bloomberg check someone like looking work guess womp 
wonder something party polling offices around country make accessible voters maybe even ads voting early prevent enormous wait times 
it's money if wants spend way power 
well definitely live username give 
if really believe every moderate racist think lot would disagree friend racism certainly issue candidate handle whoever end 
jack dorsey seems truly profoundly wholly give shit bots manipulating twitter hope perception wrong makes nigh impossible cynical 
iirc decriminalize expunge records board yet straight legalization wants research bit old man stance sure lobbied playing safe understandable want cause substance abuse problem country 
he also ceding ground game operation biden huge 
bernie's politics bottomless pit expenses republicans know bill alone could cost trillion reiterate billion years that's like entire gross domestic product we rob they're homeless still pay large and forget free college bernie promises lower people's taxes year one then passes plans he'll bankrupt us 
also lose primary attempt hold party hostage threatening stay home general select guy going attack sanders supporters know end team good people but extremists really make angry this whole if nominate bernie young hand election trump mentality extremely anti democratic considering mobilize youth vote last night looks like staying anyway so might well get behind turn rest liberal america 
recognizing praise oppressive communist dictators 
same really liked pete's candidacy nothing amazing interactions volunteers online 
it still bloomberg money biden campaign 
https imgflip com xj jpg 
love joe really hard get past and voting ask dont tell tho endorsements candidates i'm sure push 
speaking extremists last night someone asking could happened bernie's reddit much active bidens it reminded reaction brexit second vote solidly failed stop they understand subreddit then one guy chimes saying realizes maybe people read echo chambers give false impression it's really interesting watch 
yeah whole i'll drive this bus off the cliff and kill us all if don't get my way infuriating incredibly counterproductive want anything burn things trump style implementing lot bernie's agenda require years democratic control chambers time like many voting rights act could gutted guard ever goes people going get bus asap 
there lot said agree everything bernie says die hard yang supporter but much rather someone feel actually cares bring new ideas biden trump things know people always say nothing change politician and could true either least trying democrats try get moderate one excited attempt make progressive wonder loose main point calling bro literally made whole thread use fox news talking points roast 
fan bloomberg but appreciate fact cares deeply gun violence climate change defeating authoritarian wannabe white house applaud biden recognizing qualities putting money mouth at time come back bernie turns away joe rogans endorsement dude given platform racists misogynists even oligarch wannabes claim hate 
and many new bernie fans win today acting like 
the uk election one partially explained labour inexplicable strategy neutral brexit even majority britain party libdem really viable 
he cares much gun violence climate change supported republicans 
believe key factor flipping house seats helped including lucy mcbath cite aid major contributing defeat republican incumbents which red blue given bernie credit seat

joe biden tops bernie sanders washington presidential primary 
up tuesday said biden's weakest areas west that's true anymore 
like the primary big hit washington voters total votes counted democrats' thursday night just people participated party's precinct caucuses dominated sanders supporters 
margin washington insanely strong my projections state maybe stretch likely falling bernie while turnout also nice realistically going democrat matter wins 
this completely ignored politics bernie supporters go life thinking washington state 
ex vice president joe biden finished first sen bernie sanders washington's tuesday presidential primary putting virtually campaign statewide totals tallied thursday night show votes candidate current vote spread the results within article match currently wa sos site https wa gov democratic party html timestamp last updated pm edit from another www seattletimes com seattle news politics update thursdays count shows biden steadily pulling away sanders couple hundred thousand ballots remain counted statewide according estimates secretary state office but barring late reversal wind winning state many pegged favorable 
washington state welcome anti malarkey revolution 
me american europe can't read fucking hate gdpr laws idiots brussels came 
joe biden tops bernie sanders questionable way phrase 
if two man race think biden would lost california 
biden probably favored pretty well oregon point 
wonder hillary would wa primary year 
question caucus used general elections states primaries flat put better mail ballots all need add ranked voting 
sanders rowdy supporters everything heard wonder good caucuses 
well matter house state legislature we need defend kim schrier's seat seattle suburbs also flip one final gop seats touching pacific ocean southwest wa portland's our still pretty narrow senate big holdup aggressive legislation issue alike climate change winning another really unblock dems passing anything want even allowing defections 
yep its swing states matter sadly 
here's direct link results https vote wa gov federal all html 
if can't access usually means there's something dodge website those idiots brussels well protect data here's mirror article https www msn com en us news politics joe biden tops bernie sanders washington presidential primary ar bb 
especially look early voting vs day biden pretty people voted buttigieg klobuchar dropped easily 
it's clear he's picked pete's half warren's nearly klobuchar bloomberg voters 
especially harris endorsed week earlier guess saving michigan 
no caucuses used general they're dumb sure sanders supporters spend time crying working class people work hard long hours childcare impossible navigate then demand middle day school gym tuesday playing musical chairs campaign surrogates yell 
no caucus option internal party business like primaries it used general election anywhere us 
no voters always go polls general election 
i'd wager sanders supporters statistically likely politically active biden making participate weird convoluted ways vote 
yeah half american websites want comply use vpn silly like jeez every single website europe what cookie settings and sometimes things buggy can't read confirm selection phone it's pissing like i'm looking make bomb something 
to fair i'm banned expected props mods or maybe havent seen yet 
doesnt take genius know thing two voting 
if bernouts studied voting would vote biden 
sorry clear she primary bernie caucus counted unfortunately delegate totals already allocated https www seattletimes com seattle news politics wash primary saying win count 
yes precise saying cast ballots vs going polls one way ballot the point general election decided caucusing 
really then biden run limited presence campaign the talks people dislike before moderates coalesced stop bernie free fall polls there's record 
ah ok very odd certainly answers question 
why states count one politics weird 
right okay good point either way glad mail especially 
do data every time speaks people dislike going throw talking points learned dumb fuck socialist like good sheeple why would rally much leading race winning huge margin biden free fall another point biden national polls since election started he dropped bernie bloomberg entered moderates stopping who thought calling everyone running establishment shill shaming based arbitrary purity tests lead hate endorse even closest candidate agrees 
yeah odd even though caucuses counted primary got higher turnout 
not really the state runs primary happens regardless whether parties use gop used results 
it's even weirder in texas primary caucus counted delegates clinton obama 
calling socialist needed hear lmao dont even know definitions ideologies anyone trust say matter also warren took super pac money backed embracing wokeness trying smear bernie not ally another thing never says shit supporters shows everyone dislikes based snowflakey entitlement laden sense offended actually looked read facebook comments american electorate ignorant disengaged unwilling slightest bit research casting vote 
mean way easier vote mail waiting hours caucus surprising primary higher turnout 
know definition read democratic socialism democratic political philosophy supporting democracy within socially owned economy particular emphasis workers' self management control economic institutions market socialist form decentralised planned you one understand terms warren back anything this another purity test bernie sanders took super pac money btw also gives shit american electorates ignorant like said electores actually american system pass policies unlike 
if you actually knew terms would know democratic socialist policies closely align social democracy much still capitalist he essentially moderate better countries western europe his plan doesnt even go far britain's otherwise known europe's america conservatism meaning hospitals entirely govt owned operated merely single payer system towards private super pac money bribe you take playing game longer representing people favor corporations that said show proof sanders took grateful 
he literally calls democratic socialist wtf essentially moderate better countries no his plan goes beyond britian european https edition cnn com politics private health insurance medicare international comparison index html doesnt even go far britain's otherwise known europe's america conservatism another talking point bernout without evidence do repeat say see super pac money bribe clearly know that said show proof sanders took would grateful www politico story bernie super sanders contributor http opensecrets org members congress summary cid cf chl captcha tk dc cd cccc axzpps jifilwkndn ydeermvzg vstzhkhf oldt mvjbjdf yq nhuza mpkvh twh lpvttx ildnxiu kbu mapelhwegbf bggkq qmtfmh vyff vhyv mwpkrnspx tj pm endpmgnnrlua qwjdbsogxvw lbldwcuvhtnldz gcpzqbb mvf eqhba vbqdbgfmtyhptq um ev uyrkzymxmmkdutr dx ddyf vucu yulbwmfc jyadlgwm prcfwesjqfpxheb mkpajo apuja liif zgzjnmlj qxz nr lsjuhvqd nho tub mck kfhbvgos xdjg nwebgozq xcnurm bcufy dhmqpmzcfxwzk ct zqcl qisxu dtb ib mdvdcpi imy fnroopyeqhymmysvub lvkeijkw zvrvufci eopxl bz 
biden defends archbishop desmond tutu denounces apartheid 
love biden that number years 
yeah saw video recently remember hearing years back considered bit firebrand spoke but nowadays think approach something people respond better although interesting public perceptions change time 
hes defiantly racist pretty cool 
whenever see young joe also beau 
damn good video biden showed lot passion 
but politics told joe biden segregation proponent racist 
where hell joe biden go love see fire used seeing video wrong decades things like drugs iraq banking policy etc expecting sanders lose nomination videos help bring folks progressive union activist board 
he always snack yeah said 
first heard people used claim racist it blew mind new pc make sense 
no fit berniebro narrative guess could show dismiss old therefore irrelevant sure say well wait which way work we bring footage fits confirmation bias 
he well spoken full passion solid argument his anger focused directed he's got stutter either this joe biden take trump debates could paul ryan hope pull republicans going nice 
but biden was never on the right side of history 
politics also told sanders going win landslide revolutionize america how could lie 
no thinks joe biden perfect and definitely made mistakes buts always done state delaware believed best since poorest man congress entire congressional career yes even poorer bernie personal enrichment here things also certain group people like think sponsored first climate bill back almost recognized issue fought gun control nra nra helped get elected congress landmark legislation violence women act significantly increasing recourse victim domestic abuse sexual assault lead defeat anti abortion activist judge bork senate he but neither right need 
mean clip see slur words abandon thoughts jump thought forget name person he's talking it nothing mental acuity biden today back he's polished say pete buttigieg got passion necessary 
it matter though donald trump office need even care debates all get stage lie inflate ego why say debate fox news says they destroyed hillary email bs means nothing stop try people vote going ignore noise would approach election differently special case biden amazing speaker help piece country back together prevent dangerous decisions made bernie served one term this building recover alliances stock market guess recovering recession well already helped us old hat stuff he life learning new things difficult age expert tends remain much stable just joe clearest diction speeches mean capable words meaningless 
oh stomp trump debates like stomped paul ryan probably even because got years experience back 
he definitely always stumbled words speaks clearer heart vs prepared 
heard we're bringing back bidenbro 
look forward return bidenbro memes 
loved memes late made pain bit easier 
honestly biden needs his support young people could definitely improve i'm sure bringing back would help 
god damnit lots wait fucking lots where is and my terrible yet amazing biden bro memes 
i'm riding along waiting joe pete memes start tbh 
one approve blaitent karma whoring 
unfortunately sub dominated former obama biden fans turned bernie bro see fucking mitch mcconnell 
the onion also needs pull head bernie ass start giving us diamond joe carving initials tables smoking fatties riding loud hogs eta petition mfers 
i'd like get anti biden crap sub 
year old biden supporter still thinks social media new fangled maybe something supporting lol

nate silver based indicators biden popular candidate among working class democratic voters 
but bernie fights working class bull like yadda 
whaaaaat mean working class voters hivemind universally desperate charge left shocking 
thank sick tired reading billionaires corporations reason biden winning voters like work living do voice 
biden's support among working class grew lot yesterday 
but possible hearing bernie champion working class 
when comment make sure see politics haha by definitions fit people tell bernie demographic kills say want not person 
will interesting see wins michigan wisconsin ohio penn think appeal working class voters question where draw line classified 
and young people come vote love 
dude tired revisionist bullshit likes others pushing saw tweet https twitter com msmelchen status today someone dislikes sanders hates biden claiming primary process selects worst candidate the actual fuck literally people want just like mean get spout broken democracy work say joe second choice much personal garner largest coalition become successful making progress even means putting aside first and happy stand behind that fact matter extremist type little appeal outside bracket see mile away likely lose trump manage win nothing would done 
bernie may spout lot crap billionaires corporations sure problem living like one one example much guy loves fly ridiculously expensive gulfstream airplanes 
of course voice and revolution comes educated praise dear leader like good subject 
he's champion young politically lost college aged people bearing progress actually made figured trotsky something 
think base income levels probably working class above poverty line less per year 
going give sarcastic response i'll take step back belikepete what think donald trump president beneficial working class 
he telling need afraid his policies going raise taxes goal upend lives lifestyles we good working class without bringing huge revolution span four years 
it necessarily beneficial working class miss point sitting thinking wall street they interests monolithic 
mean sanders could probably get lot done democrats controlled houses congress thats unlikely candidate progressives better legislature sponsoring bills getting passed presidents desk with biden ballot dems well i've seen 
that mighty fine projecting sir 
unfortunately seem exception rule ideology though the quote justified rings true politics subsidiaries days anyone dissents slightest bernie if run asshole morning ran assholes day voted primary reddit zealots occasionally making buyers remorse 
sorry biden bros did make 
that honest insight biden good working class part trump bad you got answer sorry one wanted 
interesting i've joe since announced candidacy guess might recall use twice sounds weird

the weird part perfectly fine lot sanders policies attacked thinking efficient work within existing framework rather try overhaul everything like person remembers much lifting went getting aca passed 
remember pro bernie influence campaign russia gong speak do believe second anyone reddit even honest actor 
can point all align democratic socialism that's really pisses sanders supporters extent even moderates there much unites us divides we want expanded healthcare just biden believe going radical europe would like yeah um thanks reductions college tuition whack it's making outlandish promises never pass smell test helps one infrastructure reforms boost alternative energy somehow cutting natural gas consumption realistic flipping light switch bernie believes etc etc the foundations social programs is problem term perverted right minded people communism far left use try moderate fact unrealistic goals 
think careful may seem like personal attacks sanders supporters we'll need biden wins nomination there's unites us divides realize people view responding kind thus fair game we're better besides division exactly russia wants general within democratic party particular the stridently anti establishment online cases paid rubles post moscow shocked fake type sites well go ways intended cause divisions could last election another thing worth keeping mind might intend broadside bernie bros interpreted narrowly attack folks sending hate emails threats candidates going sitting home love favor medicare all something connection campaign toxic internet aimed increases sanders' ability push narrative holding trump picked already try separate eventual nominee advance turns anyone keep eyes prize make case preferred positive way at minimum would avoid attacking candidate even felt candidate's record agenda priorities present clear contrast primary voters 
https images app goo gl if ewvgvxn qiva 
you beat hate love don't need engage fully correct facts kill kindness disengage pop echochambers though that mess narratives social media run unopposed 
took look politics last night strong bias towards sanders biden 
it fun games trump guy problem free speech everyone 
got yelled minutes yesterday saying house flipping tax bullshit 
just imagine situation bernie actually wins election there going back we undo trump one likes policy looks good outside incentivize people work generate wealth 
former pete supporter biden train there time intrigued bernie sanders after watching campaign way treated dems jose happy joe 
op proud democrat also dae black people uneducated monkeys https imgur com zjvyifz jpg democrats astroturfed hard and coming angles your song dance similar spotting last couple weeks 
having man repeatedly called black hispanic peoples poor next nothing besides swordwiggle electable moniquer also willing fix incredible wealth desparity country insulting reason like support frankly baffling given thought running senator earlier month 
loled hard remark because pete who's never served washington apparently insider but warren us senator work dc she's senator ma feel really unrecognizable right it's bizarre who giving terrible political advice it looks like even going win today home state her whole campaign full missed good opportunities trying run exactly sanders lane always backfire ratfuck end one remember antics showcasing ratfucking and trying totally passive showing different at beginning proudly said capitalist thought top two contender come super tuesday she could gone way carved sweet spot away bernie area hillary successful deciding primaries last debates focused murdering bloomberg focusing beating polls poor display instincts some people thing makes executive branch candidate times instead shine better legislator there's nothing wrong look nancy pelosi help stave disaster instrumental getting aca passed also nd line potus being lots real power think shines simple keep ted kennedy democrat lion senate kennedy's old office i'd love see majority leader be generation's senate want kamala leaders least that's cents 
actually laughed loud saw comment on planet buttigieg beto washington insiders lmao warren sanders literally senators fail see that's washington insider 
it's sometimes sad telling various people backs wall 
warren disappointed would earn vote someone primaried 
my view senator warren may positioning consensus nominee potential brokered convention imagine biden sanders come milwaukee site summer's national substantial delegate counts threshold in theory balloting stale mates rounds beyond party need find someone acceptable camps active campaign organization profile claim sort chance win november almost one could standing start close enough policy might hold supporters contested scenario self declared capitalist alienated delegates make unpalatable majority clear neither get watching take trump debates way demolished bloomberg advocating i'm voting saying good case made compete put forward compromise candidate got several ballots became never going vote guy needed order either nomination one even see strategic move block buttigeg klobachar putting top trying force would favor eventually it's unlikely reasons first foremost able raise funding stay race least home state tonight course secondly since which shows must given talked every years however else she'd right at minimum hoping use influence platform something think winning getting obtained via primaries caucuses realistic point barring tremendous showing 
same hate bernie driving much division party this perfect example trumpism democrats 
and that's fine if biden gets nod hold nose vote in general democratic solidarity matters disregard commenter either side encouraging protest bad actors abound never forget remember primary conservative strategy discourage voting do let happen 
i'd vote anyone except trump sanders both demagogues terrible 
think well part summer bernie would make worst president democrats running exception gabbard maybe somw people dropped way primaries began didnt look 
honestly would rather trump bernie 
would rather divide vote two parties ensure dem left party wins higher office 
as aoc put belong party of course i'm welcoming want part fuck right 
or reddit demographic heavily favour sanders not everything conspiracy 
lmao ridiculous why cross username 
they've done everyone who's dropped endorsed biden 
sanders get healthcare done obama intellectual heavy lifting capable 
fuck must people continually conflate democratic socialism social democracy they thing democratic means seizing production abolishing private property enterprise we align social political economic philosophy supports interventions promote justice within framework liberal polity capitalist oriented economy vs supporting socially owned particular emphasis workers' self management control institutions market socialist form decentralised planned not the same thing 
agree points little target europe wanting sander's medicare for all most already similar extensive healthcare plans this article https www verywellhealth com difference universal coverage single payer system text health coverage around world today countries offer true switzerland united kingdom goes great detail 
most europe already bernie platform doesn mean right say would every developed nation single payer healthcare public option let private insurance companies extort little bit 
yes tax people making makers efficient that's productive 
ad hominem attacks refusing discuss serious concerns bernie's plans get passed good faith always met condescending tone etc also told afterward ignore shitty behavior pay attention policy the onus candidate's supporters act surrogates candidate undecided voters look past i'm still decided seeming culture we're morally righteous either board clearly hate poor people attractive one if kind movement bernie leading sure want country 
like https redd dhvphwaiak jpg 
why brigading clear prefer different candidate let guess this campaign turns people away 
see used bernie supporters lot think wonderful way absolve responsibility regarding shitty behavior basically argument bernie's super awful people matter undecided voters look past the issue human nature work if whole candidacy staked revolution experience many targeted bullied online they're understandably going positive view campaign so morally righteous hold much water sorry 
past behaviour best predictor future 
the media dnc done nothing cater biden despite polling performance story course bernie voters mean us resent clear bias hilarious next time joe lies arrested support civil rights movement it entertaining watching everyone blink wildly trying pretend one many charms calling let party pearl clutching begin continues losing streak even big win south carolina lol let's relive obama pathetic backwards thinking finest 
it's super wild see unfolding turned really terrible political instincts genuinely surprised 
well put thought going ride progressive favors responsible capitalism lane think could done well 
and last debates focused murdering bloomberg focusing beating ma polls poor display political instincts tbf confronting st debate great decision it set apart defender democrats however let someone else take reigns nd 
it means people disliked pete beto liked lot ideas relatively popular puts inside compared polarizing figures divisive policy 
beto house rep see valid claim spending decades dc make bernie insider 
of candidates still race warren supporters likely go sanders let stay long wants lol 
it absolutely bernie trump lesser two evils the reason voted clinton last time 
blue matter we gonna make sure blue biden still voting 
if comes trump sanders voting 
what shitty fucking timeline live 
roses liberals they're authoritarians likely find common ground maga that's many bros voted put trump top midwest problem another win crowned handed absolute unquestioning dictatorial control party 
because aoc gatekeeper none us asked need 
thanks completely understand bizarre nature hate social media i've found sub miraculously free 
having dealt extensively moderators banned multiple occasions relatively innocent infractions going nature taking course dark money groups like our revoltion literally pay agitators mods whoever we'd know nothing citizens united ruling they're exploiting there's also lot mod turnover resulting homogeneous views plurality really wish reddit would turn sanders sub create new political default many rhe alternatives currently exist boring dead go specific candidates subreddits something neoliberal actually intriguing engagements 
reddit demographic heavily favour sanders probably but see upvote process genuine political politics plastered pro bernie media hillary slamming passed went back normal posting news articles various issues 
posterity reddit doxxing rules want break feel free follow account already links screenshots delete information though 
agree similar but europe explicitly ban private insurance in bernie sanders plan he'll basically shut industry beyond realistic something even countries like australia touch https www vox com health care single payer harris sanders 
every developed nation single payer healthcare https en wikipedia org wiki universal health care funding models please modicum research vote multipayer public option prevalent among countries 
posted european systems still involve private insurance industry if listen bernie intends shut moment steps foot white house https www vox com health care single payer harris sanders 
it hard back sanders way supporters treated us the onus candidate's act good surrogates candidate really think point voting how political debates transpire social media indication politician's demeanor judgment definitely policy you're know feels natural want vote withhold spiting seemingly hostile demographic politics inherently tribal that's logical course action at least see enacting societal change opposed something purely full disclosure would bernie warren biden primary hesitate general even progressive friends screamed obscenities differences among democratic platforms relatively nothing compared nominee vs current gop platform if devolve holding grudges toward candidates early say flippantly arguments we're doomed that's equivalent red hats remark this trump every time egos bruised inane 
i'm sorry happened that unacceptable bernie supporter think present state country broken needs radically changed people right angry end day we're americans trying make better place you deserve 
thank request comrade ozoning said word yet 
lmao ok that years wondering 
know years showing exceptional democratic instincts this believe spark shines senator 
she would excelled lane and probably right i'm even professional political strategist could easily see situation winning strategy why really wondering heck giving bad advice

biden january concerned trump shortsighted policies left us unprepared dangerous epidemic 
damn maybe call money joe on the fucking money 
this guy got weeks early epidemic time counted millions lives 
wow way possible heard trump nobody even thought virus month ago citation https www msnbc com rachel maddow show trump falsely claims ever most logical explanation evil genius pretending senile biden secretly controlled media got usatoday backdate article 
yes biden right and let face leader call senators mayors local officials get universities research hospitals develop use mass testing we unable control months know disease asymptomatic carriers don listen news media outlets saying covid spread late media brought us president trump support even people dying streets believe made grave sociopathic decisions regarding pandemic this criminal friends position tackle calamity next thing want survive self isolate sadly that point told whole family lose home jobs least others around stay safe alive cause death believe corporate america wont look gut feeling telling natural selection take horrible times cry grocery stores pharmacies nurses doctors frontline must shut everything do folks now 
hey mods new flair joe money 
he's far one bring point 
the deep state would like know location 
well said late january right as far remember many people talking possibility emergency epidemic time since thought containment would prove effective mitigate influx infection i'm glad joe tuned good quality presidential candidate 
new message hillary clinton stay 
joe biden presidential candidate who's said trump's reaction covid left us unprepared 
not problem easy miss words 
only candidate chance winning yes 
that's different statement why disingenuous is we're going beat trump 
i'm quite sure less square trump stage 
would hoped title post beginning biden january might meant timing understood misunderstanding insignificant details going beat trump 
why disingenuous call minor distinction when asume bad faith part people basis discussion come across less interested provoking try better 
that would responding statement directly 
maybe opinion wasnt minor distinction there's big difference never january 
well beat last democratic contender didnt you expect joe bumble victory 
he beat hated woman america furthermore lost debates mean squat also biden far bumbling 
what bernie supporters last night 
but sanders california delegates arr politics in seriousness congrats team biden lost hope election year im feeling much better future great country

it's general meme dw see everywhere 
find interesting many fixated warren's delegates ignoring fact candidates endorsed biden so assume warren's went sanders also bloomberg's buttigieg's klobuchar's which would give even bigger lead 
one day difference pete vote would biden 
want win big tomorrow help us make calls washington idaho michigan post questions 
lots people afraid phonebank think mean most nice hang 
also giant hypocrite call people never pick phone kind surprised see lots even recognize number

what get voicemail left short messages reminding vote but app say 
it baffles me that people do this 
you either training join slack read pdfs 
make sure candidates hate much vote nice try troll go back worshipping monstrous practices ncaa cult college athletic page 
yup that definitely worry one reason call people talked biden supporters thought going cut social security bernie said people kinds worried voting vote 
washington votes mail ballots already arrived covid bad enough people can't make mailbox 
literally sign start making calls 
it sounds like might suffering kind comprehension issue maybe check doctor 
making life tv on tv surely mistake what's deal

you guys even win primary how going general hillary beat bernie she better candidate boy like joe get

yep voted bernie texas was truly hopeful would excite younger voters turn like hoping all joe return sense normalcy allowing rbg retire next term ready step right direction nothing else 
thanks joining i'm old warren supporter helping even tn goes red presidential election lot work done locally regionally don't forget ballot races swing house senate local government the blue areas family near loudon county plus 
honestly look website read platform lot issues take note things surprised talk you'll find policies idea biden supported stuck environment screams he's basically republican ear constantly for starters universal healthcare via expanding free access government funded federal decriminalization marijuana purposes federal legalization medical rescheduling research encouraging states fully legalize wanted minimum wage eliminating private prisons mandatory sentences jail time drug use ending cash bail pro nuclear energy plan net zero emissions the biggest lie joe right he's going status quo actual reality progressive presidential nominee ever talk stuff 
you sign phone text bank joe's website looks like someone linked i've done several times spent three hours texting illinois arizona voters yesterday welcome aboard 
glad let go save democracy on top phone banking instead possible knock doors battleground state are close populated areas north carolina ohio texas 
voted bernie planning convinced need joe biden my concern defeating trump returning normalcy all want president someone intelligent calm leader experience importantly truly cares us that he always right matters go

take jump another train read like taking chicago lol 
impressed speech yesterday that's leadership sounds like 
as person typing laptop pete stickers welcome well 
probably still going need lot convincing get independent voters bernie they're type value principle rather lesser evil 
is peak performance looks like 
hey another bernie supporter i've actually gone pete yang biden share switching campaigns lmao gladly vote current fuck face chief day week 
hear god seems crazy years went al gore blackburn alexander specifically live east tennessee drive anti abortion sign every day middle west tennessee still hope 
people forgetting status quo president grabs women pussy joe 
and get years trump mild offering like biden that's many bernie bust yet convinced otherwise considering biden's desire keep things 
love team pete forward supporting front runner democratic party solidarity saying betomaniac 
if principles like getting kids cages taking actionable steps climate change anything hard know go 
perfect in either september october spend couple saturdays knocking doors you'll find person canvassing usually much effective phone calls caveat social distancing protocols may make people hesitant answer door strangers campaign shirts alert 
think fully understand meaning principles bernie's millions independent voters believe general common good that's helping everyone live better life period this already includes immigrant kids border nearly trillion new green deal compared biden's you're absolutely right hard know votes going we they'll vote bernie regardless even he's nominee why because biden little runs cages begin greatest threat us climate change spending likely lose without independents if wants win needs start thinking they want offering honestly point progressives basically entirely different party would rather see dnc reinforce status quo another years 
think lot progressives thrilled biden happily vote included contrarian independent type may voted trump last election wanted outsider matter politics plus extreme left wing party but definitely capture moderate conservatives dislike never would bernie much common 
disagree the path election pander who'd write bernie ge elected sits moderate never trumper republicans independents and get making big promises hyperpartisan alienating people progressives would rather four years trump joe can't call anymore if pick regress slight progress entiteled probabaly even progressive betterment country personal gains 
exactly biden needs moderate gop vote lots bernie exit polls showed voters already convinced general when voted way republicans lot supporters reddit extremists most reluctantly ready support lots come around november 
and progressives would rather four years trump joe can't call anymore left leaning populists 
agree it gets point people seem really want feel relevant they think hold election hostage candidate win nomination i'm getting whiplash watching transitions basic rights everyone fuck poor women maybe part reason movement catching momentum ideological whenever they're questioned and mean entitled white males know majority bernie supporters not like 
they minority real life even lot reddit 
illinois governor pritzker endorses joe biden 
unironically billionaire and damn good governor 
live southern il idea governor mom came home cursing guy shutting restaurants things virus overblown 
really disliked pritzker getting elected much ended voting rd party impressed leadership skills this another win joe 
pritzker gave bit slimeball vibe campaign happy say wrong man what great governor state 
one best young governors country future star party sure 
when said the federal government needs get shit together now he meant 
he already rauner blago would done crisis 
idk man illinois good governor go well together sentence 
speaking illinois resident god damn time governor actually cares citizens nuts enforce policies 
bu bu told billionaires bad 
one upside billionaire politicians assuming morally good they're mostly immune special interest money 
his response trump malarkey night everything https twitter com govpritzker status this one vote think ever regret he wonderful informative entire covid crisis far helped calm nerves knowing illinois local government competent least 
kinda cool getting good press last days railing trump admin 
he trying protect people like mom getting sick 
that's weird thing governing state like illinois something state's population six county area northeast corner you smaller metro areas central peoria springfield cham bana etc southern third either totally small town rural much connected st louis 
how quinn keep hearing referred forgotten one if lost rauner even amazing 
lol he's exception rule il 
you right lol actually pretty good far but know governor mansion attracts crooks turns people only time tell 
it helps expectations low last two counting quinn 
true as illinois resident gained lot support last couple days 
i've never heard urbana champaign referred cham bana i'm going refer thank 
yea everyone around identifies stl anything else 
ok guess probably unforgettable lol living another state college run pay much attention unfortunately illinois never great leadership taxed everything surprised breathable air tax still huge deficit no clue money goes 
think quinn ever really wanted governor blagojevich tagged lt gov basically mike pence someone much less corrupt case shit went before better known public advocate things like utility prices good guy ineffective 
quinn terrible he reason ended rauner 
quinn lt gov blagojevich think main reason lost blag got pardon trump 
by standards going prison makes among best governors 
but bruce rauner never went prison meh governor best 
as someone went school bloomington call blo no 
went school areas fascinating exchange right blo 
yeah i've heard one lived had bachelor party circle lanes ozark house kappa kabanna stayed holiday inn north end normal think kk still open 
biden spent advertising california still gets 
and good chunk vote least think came early voting lot people voted joe current momentum started 
people ignore much bernie buys votes 
essentially biden gained voters per cent spent california 
biden took money politics mainly establishment ready toss curb three days ago 
most people probably care important pay staff fair wages biden's largest expense staff's salaries https www opensecrets org presidential race expenditures id sander's expensive media his salary really appreciate candidate prioritizes paying first 
praying viable cuz friend leading vote 
who needs money organizing joementum 
name recognition common sense incredible asset 
can someone explain biden seem spend much time money st states i'm thrilled well absent 
hope biden campaign get better general tbh 
crazy beneficial joe bloomberg gets 
one ca votes joe strong showing really shows money bloomberg cannot buy 
sanders lead go another couple percentage points his probably around give take 
who watches ads anymore seriously seen ad years dvr streaming services 
so better expected california imagine kamala joined beto pete amy monday night 
truly amazing american voter saying right given joe spent fraction sanders reminds us no hero bullshit king worship like democracy fight soul nation go go america 
registered republican like trump biden support bernie bit much 
left leaning democrats get money politics not disagree btw joe ok 
my small four person business spends money per month digital ads that's nothing holy cow 
wow total annihilation i'm relieved america going socialism street killed countless millions 
don need spend money ads get hundreds millions dollars free positive media coverage 
literally saw one biden commercial cycle monday night 
it pete hovering near viability ca 
glad never see another mike will get done ad 
biden eight years free positive advertising 
how much super pacs spend 
this important point it take count vote there couple million early votes that's mostly reported lot us held ballots yesterday able switch pete amy tom still think bernie win ca going closer 
one votes absentee ballot pete would joe voted yesterday and lot us maybe enough give state later 
bloomberg per vote sanders biden now spent million ads joe calculations would billion votes california 
please ya'll talented people please start making info graphics spending biden hit hard billionaires funding campaign need shareable highlight little joe spent st states compared bernie 
including free shit offers voters 
how buy votes most campaign contributions millions americans donating money sure people donated going vote so 
someone who's efficient money probably really important job 
wonder much sanders' media expenditures include social manipulation 
and decades long career helping people 
joe keeping powder dry general 
hopefully saving cash general everyone starts injecting biden ballot dem campaign 
they need hire geniuses helped win iowa almost nh that help lot 
older people still religiously watch television news i'm guessing also old actually show vote large numbers 
biden basically exactly predicted less behind sanders bloomberg however majorly underperforming likely viable statewide biden's advantage 
even bernie became president think he's reality much left moderate proponents inclined admit never going happen most likely case carteresque mess 
biden type broad support money can't buy 
margin victory something even putin could pull 
know criticism messaging free shit sounds pretty close denigrating real anxieties needs poor bernie tapping something biden step plate speak 
i'ts free shit it's way life sustain majority poverty uninsured homeless struggling it paid 
you buy vote spending money ads only couple million people donated bernie lot money votes thing 
it spending ads asking money 
well explains ads reason travel well now feel bad waiting long donate nominee lost big ia dropped polls knew biden trouble donated immediately win sc 
agreed also sounds much like sort line republican party used decades refer pretty social safety net 
yes hinting something real his spending proposals ridiculous lot middle class upper folks look think better bernie charge only issue never feasible without reducing well ways taxes deficit broken promises tanking economy capital flight 
for us read reddit despite fact prefer another candidate 
he spent time first states 
i'm voting blue no matter who although strongly dislike bernie suspect many people like wanted sure biden survived super tuesday actually viable committing money campaign the real fight general election trump democrats absolutely must win now clearly frontrunner i'll donating much spare 
he traveled strategically like va every weekend last fall elections year state legislatures rallying support people remember appreciate paid clearly large margin virginia biden bernie 
his time already maxed states strategic gamble paid big 
yup i'm always hesitant donate primaries care way general feel like burning money loser if candidate loses fine i'll go swinging democrats my vote going whoever polling better swing states getting trump barr miller dwarfs policy concerns biden bernie differently lot he's frontrunner without ton attacking comfortable setting recurring contribution 
well whatever worked like charm 
yeah good nationwide polling he needed stem bleeding caused low placings early contests getting nd nevada accomplished 
hey pete beat iowa lol 
i'm almost certain originated neoliberal subreddit 
so biden defeat sanders primaries destroy world afterwards buttigieg president remaining handful people thanos shows kill next movie 
why bernie camp feel entitled win they sudden think voice people unstoppable candidate what barely edge pete and lot moderate candidates competition divide support 
beat iowa tied new hampshire

joe biden maintains lead bernie sanders friday ballot counts washington primary 
former vice president joe biden maintained lead vermont sen bernie sanders count ballots friday washington presidential primary as evening led nearly statewide vote compared candidate votes current spread results wa sos site https results wa gov democratic party html timestamp last updated pm flipped pacific skagit chelan counties there's chance might flip grant adams the difference county 
this primary waste time point can end focus main election already 
sweeps tuesday think bern finally burnt 
my ballot finally counted joe friday 
bernie needs concede he's helping trump covid spread 
let's go pacific county one longest democratic streaks going blue 
thanks report wonder state coronavirus spike something slow results come regardless looks like gonna big win joe 
we'd love long bernie insists still running worry uniting party first hopefully joe wins states tuesday bow think wants chance debate vote drops unreasonable opinion if stays he's actively helping trump though posing health risk considering virus 
at point even public health risk getting people come bernie path nomination unnecessary 
if bernie win washington outright electable trump personally like admire energy created awareness income inequality something important but 
don't like half states still vote if primaries ended got probably november 
he's helping trump why think if biden nominee going stop covid how 
i'm sure count ballots weekend this wa sos site says https www sos wa gov office covid response aspx starting monday march secretary state offices divisions around state closed public notice exception executive legislative building olympia information go effect the elections general initiatives referenda filings processed located message wyman health safety staff visit paramount in order maintain safe environment everyone suspending majority person services effective means access limited small number transactions require face interactions vast needs addressed online phone email want assure office remain fully operation time performed accomplished via virtual processes we seek always provide excellent customer service effort continue understand uncertain troubling many world spite collective concerns encourage part keep families co workers neighbors adhering recommendations made trusted sources centers disease control prevention washington department health 
hope bernie uses debate chance allow biden unite party 
sanders opened several campaign offices pa week the primary april th bernie's going scorched earth he's drag convention win lose it's not us me 
think race point poll wise 
at point believe happens smh real amount dislike guy country come first 
he staffing opening new offices pennsylvania speak plan leaving anytime soon 
well better give still fighting way race know fight maybe learn thing two throughout 
yeah look delegates it's close anymore bernie bro like lot admire warren but there's path point we focus november general election 
if bernie concedes thousands potentially millions people need go public stand line vote the virus spreads come contact do every time says something negative biden helps trump it's like writing campaign ad 
biden already done everything unite party virtually every democrat endorsed sanders person preventing unity 
no biden shows stroke something worse condition better fight end dnc make minds 
if biden performs well even close polls showing florida my belief former bernie supporter sanders hopefully understands stakes election trying land plane bring many supporters possible behind nominee 
if people think primary rigged anyway biden beat trump november 
maybe instead endorsements exists it sways away votes 
think bernie holding tomorrow's debate where attempt convince biden live tv adopt elements policies then tuesday states dropout endorse and better berners support adopts emphasis universal aspect whole proposed funding mechanism 
it's even biden severely underperforms polling put way polls end bernie incredible debate causes point swing favor wins florida points chances winning primary gone he needs win every state least order gain ground big lead proportional allocation delegates still involves getting amount 
well think anyone make accusation biden's win projected prominent decisive compared hillary's sanders but either way doubt progressives left participate much november progressive wing group big enough party's nomination indeed significant cannot ignored without help moderates struggle trump because base strong motivated whereas usually run standardized style campaign failure supports 
unfortunately doubt true bernie opened new campaign offices pennsylvania votes april th https billypenn com bernie sanders opening five joe bidens native pa he divide party ego reasons surrounded sycophants or 
agree except view bernie giving biden opportunity present platform actually progressive even bold if stay week opinion forever changed these sobering times room political games 
well think anyone make accusation biden's win projected prominent decisive yeah right rigged point try shut primary it'll look shady people start doubt democratic party trump already tweeting stuff trying bernie vote biden 
exactly fool bernie almost started buy idea backing gracefully field office pa he's taking way convention ego allow anything less 
no bernie ego what think buttigieg kolchubar dropped super tuesday endorse biden well except one state smell dirty money 
doubt bernie people would vote trump most voted hillary lost popular the real problem michael moore often states door knock biden volunteer election day and without help left grassroots level could well struggle compete campaign clearly participation that biggest threat hope i'm wrong maybe start 'moderate' movement give run money 
it's interesting suggest ego rather ideas joe biden also ran days ago according polls now lead seems unassailable sanders' time 
is sarcastic dropping support friendly candidate opposite egotistical 
most bernie people even vote trump last time white working class hated hillary's guts the progressives minority among minorities 
lmao biden point even also ran needed remaining vote reach plurality delegates bernie currently meanwhile might lose florida he done 
not well it make sense unless paid 
white working class hate hillary narrative time remember felt let democrats also hated obama may well punish party there realistic path nomination bernie point say 'the progressives minority among minority' statement completely touch reality delegates million en route replicate similar results progressives certainly group big enough take wishful thinking and type miscalculation cost

saw coming when pete made speech one thing clear going endorse bernie sanders edit clarity 
oh proxy endorsement barack nice 
it move makes sense pete brand center left endorsing bernie helps far less hurts especially indiana decide future run state office joe biden 
got chills thinking amount class professionalism must colliding conversation

mayor pete booked private jet south abend dallas seems like going endorse joe rally tonight together amy 
teampete past year i'm fully board biden i've already setup recurring donation 
the real question back us joe nominee claim rigged conspiracy stop bernie think know answer we cannot afford go general election divided obama really gonna hands full helping joe unite everyone 
he also chatted jimmy carter 
can't believe pete endorsed voting joe tomorrow mass 
pete hell man early first wondering guy election pitted someone publicity pad resume sell memo after reading little background seeing wow please make secretary state it would proud see represent us international stage 
good pete huge joe biden supporter point he's option prevent radical extremes he's also lot preferrable hilary clinton moderates like happy see klobuchar hopefully buttigieg really liked support drill could far left socialist vs whatever hell trump country needs continuing legacy obamacare creating medicare want fine bankrupting trying afford ton seemingly good social safety net benefits simply cannot neither demonizing capitalistic democracy fundamental success foundation

the ones facebook timeline saying months pete pro joe dnc plant yeah i'm sure they're fastening tin foil hats right 
think today the post super tuesday states already heavily biden favored bump gets pete would effective 
picture bernie rally after long hard thought pete decided make surprise appearance endorse he takes deep breath walks stage met chants rat wall street yeah that's shit candidates primary damn party even wanted burned bridge 
biden pelvis need nurture genxers millenial democrats government leadership positions say gay latino left handed genxer 
bragging anything i'm huge pete guy seriously right 
pro joe plant could taken nomination bloomberg iowa's incompetence sucked oxygen win iowa hardly mayor pete vice president biden ideological allies decent people but rivalry real 
lightning flashes dnc hq tom perez greetings fellow neoliberal corporate shills how prevent succs raising red banner dc election cycle evil member let's divide vote across multiple non commies the bernie bros make flaming gaping horse's asses infuriating campaigns drive support establishment brilliant but find candidates drop last minute there's mayor town indiana and amy klobuchar slow year brilliant zoom scene entire cackles evil glee 
while calling pro joe plant absurd deny dropping super tuesday points towards tactical motivation even pete rough odds going absolutely realm possibility stage game either biden campaign dnc struck form deal step funnel support presumably really think tin foil hat theory that would playing election again pro ridiculous assertion it clear every intention winning nom but let careful taking converse far throwing towel right make lot sense position otherwise hell gabbard still 
like make point every candidate portion supporters get intense speak lots friends bernie disavow bros divisiveness spewing online also think fair probability could trolls perhaps financed russia sanders serious getting nom going roads repairing bridges bro burning candidates 
anything tips scale favor say think biden going sweep st we might lose california mostly bloomberg win texas surging everywhere 
primary damn party well akkschually bernie 
you're right the bros sustained toxic atmosphere toward anyone bernie would embarrassment dems 
i'm imagining future pete ends endorsing biden super tuesday sanders delegate somewhat close totally see anti bernie add supporters calling times called republican rat fake gay cia operative think part crowd extreme switching 
agree omni sexual libertarian conservative canadian believe people age pete's millennials despite current consensus back day used say generation gen echo baby boom kids came us social media fundamentally different upbringing afterwards by mean puberty formative teen years leading adulthood soapbox 
am bragging gonna miss mayor pete until runs kicks ass 
while vying position wonder much personal like bernie hillary got pretty same amy pete but i've never gotten vibe biden buttigieg 
seriously like rig iowa caucus front runner incredibly popular vice president last administration wins instead name indiana mayor polling th make take weeks results actually come get full poll jump 
yeah think politics inherently dirty word folks everyone race indeed politician bernie joe liz pete they make strategic political choices everyday it bad thing take stock play art 
if shoes done thing staying race would lead long primary ending contested convention horribly divisive country he looked chances decided better option leverage support he's gained different position it's conspiratorial smart 
this bit ambitious we going lose co utah maine vermont sure well minnesota massachusetts though hopefully klobuchar warren win home states if tx va rest south big us also gotta solidly ca end st within delegates sanders think 
it currently looks solid sanders california colorado utah vermont likely maine lean massachusetts tossup american samoa texas biden arkansas alabama north carolina tennessee virginia oklahoma klobuchar minnesota looking good could better hopefully pete voters help us nice boost bloomberg's decline sc advantages give edit nevermind dropped rip fucking clue what's happening tomorrow 
hope it seems trending way we need bloomberg falls hard steyer sc 
according biden sweeps south tomorrow able take texas becomes front runner plurality delegates even chance reaching majority bernie wins everywhere else 
said sub last night first comment permanently banned finally help post pete dropping made if going migrate bernie dropped certainly want participate reddit channels maybe would vote maybe donate set foot toxic cesspool 
the bros loud minority sanders' supporters they sicken right pete announced dropping bunch went sub started shitting everyone it makes want facepalm hand back skull that toxic divisiveness reason left hard time holding onto office fuck bernie normal guy voted primary edit missing words 
personally see happen despite percentage toxic supporters even non extremists tend rightfully passionate policies integrity no candidate consistent message career like warren comes close if switch bernie biden primary i'd argue vote based policy two remotely similar in country would center left right wing 
agree btw living montreal since last year so voting tomorrow da 
took moment get that ride 
yeah think there's real mutual respect 
personally think dropping gives biden shot particularly california this looks increase odds contested convention unless major change pace happens yesterday that observation saying pete made bad decision looking score cabinet position whoever endorses political benefit and definitely helps warren frankly need right 
for personally vote whoever pete endorses endorse someone aligns views platform and think many supporters see 
think buttigieg dropping biden warren may viable california helps take major wind bernie's sails hope enough bloomberg voters realize worse version every way except financially consolidate behind give boost 
unfortunately already sent mail pete 
as bernie supporter may suggest wayofthebern palatable sub 
many dear friends voted vote bernie know regular good people but unfortunately minority toxic cultish bros real phenomenon loses big reason 
here's hoping see around going forward pete's great guy first choice impressed hope he's future party 
personally prefer sanders people want vote centrist better biden bloomberg pretty iffy track record policies far right he'd almost make sense republican 
it may bad that's low bar clear at glance seems quite toxic well lots attacks candidates thread titles comments 
agreed if left loses one biggest reasons i've following bernie since late cspan really want win expense unity among though maybe he's electable least presence drawing attention issues we're talking the fact mayor pete first openly gay presidential contender well also clear indication lbgt folks even dropping he'll always admiration helping open door why bros feel need attack supporters instead policies beyond 
agreed bloomberg true democrat he's less horrible republican think biden let liberal progressive wings democratic party thing elected president can't say much

i'm sure account real their entire post history divisive vitriolic see actual rational person could think type posting constructive way if what's point 
fun fact pete could run president he'd still younger sanders 
bernie took sweet ass time endorsing half heartedly nothing bullshit conspiracy theories dnc rigging destroyed almost sense party unity en percent bros voted trump protest https www npr org sanders primary voters ended supporting trump survey finds those votes could helped states hillary narrowly lost 
he stayed eliminated spent months calling clinton unqualified corrupted result enough primary supporters forclinton ghost get pa mi wi therefore trump ec million fewer votes 
fingers crossed ca tons late voters think well nd 
the russians supporting bernie know he'd lose trump they've probably got stuff worshipped ussr 
the positive thing say bernie bros least consistent any group people gets attacked homophobia pete misogyny warren racism sc voters just crazy 
ohio pete supporter voted early dropped biden last best hope 
recent polling ca we got 
sure must narrow gap biden's delegates bernie's can't said nomination stolen we cannot split sorry pete amy elizabeth mike time go home but i'll team next around 
prefer they're let people see bernie supporters really like 
enough bernie bro bullcrap flaws blame people online mean blatantly stupidly ignorant internet culture embarrassing also challenge show evidence supporters attacking pete gay 
i'm sanders supporter check comment history actions like ones take going win election convince anyone take honest look commenting ask really think helpful way if anything harmful sanders' reelection would disavow comments disavowed toxic 'supporters' 
he also said vote heart pretty much implying ok followers voting nominee 
he drip went convention already lost that's dropping it's called forfeiting game ends behind that's losing 
we want keep sub positive instead letting start catfights 
you're right past tense mistake

for talk guys unity sure heck seem care bringing sanders supporters along ride you want need us joe becomes nominee hint way 
that mean caused lose derp 
ok fair enough it worth pointing fired disavowed bernie would still point however talking small percentage people millions supporters to apply bro smear seems pretty disingenuous considering overall vitriolic nature online culture 
if legit thought sanders supporters would actually vote dem nominee might but given they've treated us since day one manner surprisingly worse trump's little inbreds sorry bro sympathy file found 
no fact enough primary supporters either vote voted rd part protest trump cost pa mi wi though 
besides see behavior everywhere else 
know fired commend bernie statement but maybe time look drawing people campaign discourage bad actors if felt good job given pete dropped to apply bro smear still seems pretty disingenuous considering overall vitriolic nature online culture obviously talking guys friends supporters totally fine discussion also bros great flip switch become unhinged talk sanders see though none said non factual additionally spent ton different forums hobbies even toxic like college football pages bodybuilding com seen nothing hate close snarky comments ones truly 
held nose voted clinton go around need that said snarky sorry bro attitude exact thing complain sanders supporters maybe recheck files supposed side if want check maybe look mirror

biden voter reporting northern va was thrilled check no malarkey ballot morning 
cnn exit poll biden dominating sanders among african american voters look amazing margin https imgur com png this huge win joe

the younger generation voting at least primary it shame much older bracket voted everything since don people understand mistake exercise basic right edit add obviously bernie just disappointment understanding ancestors fought 
winning this hrc last time so much diverse support 
arrr politics becoming dog whistling racist cesspool 
those initial delegates estimate it'll calculated votes counted 
also candidates still get delegates reach viability threshold 
go back bernie circle jerk 
yea people agree exist you're growing fast this sanders friends

where live minimum elections year the annual budget referendum general election odd numbered years town november even primaries presidential held different date least assuming contested primary level non number go fails means draft new submit occasionally special referendums bond issues matters importance 
little late party nova represent 
they make projection based exit polls recent the media say race close call otherwise there's overwhelming evidence decisive win they'll early for example one reason doubt sanders would vermont

bernie supporter i've lifelong democrat voted straight ticket every election i'll vote joe zero reason believe enough people defeat trump tied losing almost general poll conducted thus far he's well primary think rude awakening november nominate guy 
he regularly thing references day get elected without asking people support then reference ran senate says hi names joe biden running like vote guy it callback always campaigns positive inviting the actual slip started say instead end big deal imo 
love saying may please use do mind thank 
seen know likely attribute slip stutter words front catching verbal error struggled fix would give pause you social media diagnose dementa cognitive decline string second clips ignoring life long known gaffes decades released medical records december showing zero evidence anything professionally trained complex mental disorder based youtube 
hey always want joe the speaks like 
watched ryan debate today see biden different notice differences compared recent debates speeches mean stuttering fair bit destroyed paul laughed stage nothing new 
but hasnt treated us respect hes dismissive 
bernie got wiped states handily might literally get zero votes florida every recent poll shows biden polling better key state matchups trump like az you narrative shot people voted real actual results point hypotheticals theories ass kicked places needs win what say 
thank actually trying explain rather downvoting it seems like remark makes often likely properly set fact hearkening back days campaigning senate i'm uk main priority trump getting elected think he's disaster would bernie win biden urge democrats recognise going hit narrative developing try avoid far possible anything taken context lies smears unfortunately inevitable part democratic politics ways combat disinformation reduce ammunition opponents use pretending issue used help much 
so post full clip one edited lol watched whole speech also lost cool started yelling someone audience how going unite country can't take criticism 
i've watched debates well one things all i'm saying media spent many hours attacking trump stuff biden darling mention issues thought republicans supposed hypocrites 
sorry see joe says respect bernie supporters disagrees approach taking that dismissive think similar goals difference way go getting better healthcare etc 
sure joe team strategizing seems like weak attack he stutter whole life sometimes trips trump made far worse gaffes downright lies 
well first post left open interpretation 
shows biden chance getting delegate plurality majority 
don't get complacent also dick people yes would feel good others obnoxious but campaign unity compassion taking high road 
find one post berniesanders what going

bernie done yet need keep momentum going next tuesday 
having biden since beginning feels soooo good people starting see saw 
long way go bernie aint going easy 
right still need show the margins biden bernie lot super tuesday states super thin it takes people staying home next week shift tide 
agreed especially complacent believe part reason many go vote bernie past tuesday thought bag already keep publicize keep sharing joe's message 
honestly think perception he's already help people like vote winner left bloomberg warren see narrative everyone uniting around joe makes choice easier we complacent general election though really helped nail coffin hillary 
it's important establish unifying message one party unequivocally wants this time show vote every primary matters matter late things wrapped sending division tolerated democratic 
yeah nice see hard work paying we still need get vote primaries till june

joe think many us still saw candidates previously supported happy brought together one candidate though

well different situation the democratic nominee someone years republican smear campaign working biden generally well liked even republicans 
the disinformation campaign being launched against biden there data support allegation cognitive decline 
stutter get worse person ages trying keep bay take immense physical mental energy biden talks day audiences small large in addition periodically stuttering blocking certain sounds appears intentionally switching alternative word technique called circumlocution yield mangled syntax following practically everything said months sometimes quickly characterized memory lapse indeed 
grew delaware seen man speak years he occasionally done decades it new still support joe 
man's gotta stutter natural disability got stuck non cancerous bone tumors shred muscular structure nervous system i'll take joe day week 
these assholes trying pete smear seemingly plausible bs 
this kinda stuff makes yawn the person serious cognitive impairment sitting wh eating cheeseburger gone golfing 
wonder they're also pointing couple weeks ago said running senate know explanation like calling back days ask support context look weird time either way bros gotta bro that's tactic smear lie berate 
as speaking true impediment but man says important long takes say claudius robert graves 
they mocking speech impediment it sort disgusting tbh 
meanwhile bernie gets wrong plane makes tons mistakes senior moments recently heart attack oldest candidate race if want candidates acting like seniors maybe chosen opposition trump president ever even older joe 
delaware speaks like delawarean we tend proverb adage heavy speech patterns often rapid pace jumbling words together when sounds local 
it's one offensive things keeps coming politics they hillary 
we live age headlines unfortunately that whenever applicable try paste quotes sources reddit know better average chance someone going read something sadly people bothered let put best foot forward biden dissenters media summer showing joe right choice 
people need start respecting experience no one bernie senator biden vp 
maybe unpopular opinion americans come across terrible people stupidly proud jeff merkley ron wyden senators whip smart amazingly forward thinking liberal also lisp oregon care generation senator could ever run president though absolutely he ostracized mercilessly speech defect like biden would laser focus clearly fit office simply true the borderline discrimination joe especially side honestly saddens 
bernie sanders supporters become new trump honestly hell going unite attacks republicans literally grabbing popcorn every dirty attack trick wanted already done 
ptsd several traumatic events can't say certain suspect joe also suffered many tragedies experienced sorry pain public option hopefully help healthcare costs when biden wins take back senate 
say thing years muscle memory kicks 
yeah totally stupid joe experience bernie trump combined this insane argument obama picked biden always polled well working americans 
one year age difference really big deal 
do list sources could point 
people age can't bothered read that's nonsense know there's many older folks actually article worse watch fox news stay informed 
stutter lot people think repeating like saying something stop replace words else gets really bad replacing thing take 
coming someone titus said joe biden like ihadastroke pretty sure trolling 
you're trolling sub report move 
different folks use different strategies lose short term memory conversation i'm interrupted middle couple seconds due illness affects brain also can't word find well often think i've got right actually slightly inappropriate potentially offensive person talking almost synonym some condition long pauses talk super slowly slur sentences act bit terse order keep things concise institute small lengthen end words buy time queue next phrase biden spoken techniques address stutter obviously must presentations learnt 
ron wyden speech defect i'm also oregonian lol 
you king england speech impediment though 
i'm originally oh md love ron wyden 
yeah crazy system you throw talent show decide dole drone assassination privileges nuclear launch codes finland president rather severe speech impediment pronounce sounds trouble basically consonants formed front mouth she even name president tarja halonen came pwesidewnt tawja hawonen the right also criticised member church married partner election father daughter bit frumpy briefly chair seta lgbt rights association still got elected two terms that social democratic policies immensely popular happens focus issues instead running popularity contest get free health care education decades peace sure things existed ideology shared forced existence once people policy achieve wondrous but guess us knows looking like conan o'brien 
republicans going make election hunter it gonna get way uglier warren voter partly baggage biden sanders bring reminds much working ass prevent expecting outcome 
how expect unite bring sanders supporters basically equate trump it goes ways we need everyone board win no alienate bernie twitter reddit trolls stirring shit 
i've wondered he still gets yard stare brings beau 
https www google com amp politico magazine story bernie sanders heart attack businessinsider democratic candidate field ages biden oldest buttigieg youngest famp tmz boards wrong gulfstream private jet campaign 
that make sense hard figure biden came but perhaps looking much 
howdy and yeah guess used hearing makes news opb hear beloved local subreddit https np reddit com portland comments ek ron wyden reacts fcc vote uphold net regrettable googling show lisp probably way formal comment considered speech defect 
say that's lady looks like conan 
decades peace finland neutral country insignificant location still spent last seventy years preparing get wrecked soviets russians what conflicts expect would involved 
most voters dont care hunter though just ask fox news trump constantly promoting bernie sanders they want nominee people really need start using common sense do people think going win majority states bring stuff like alliance ilhan omar aoc castro china etc picture 
i'm optimistic biden's polling numbers basically totally unaffected whole burisma thing data far suggests voters think non issue 
trump put profoundly unqualified children major executive branch positions day one term his kids work grift org the two white house made money since working dad time careers bring 
spend entire primary running democratic party calling fellow democrats republicans lose nomination it worked 
uh access portland i'm liberal enough also sick it's cesspool extreme progressives conservatives roads suck know anyone even voted kate brown side spectrum did see biden polling bernie though washington incredibly shocked edit meant say higher oregon

dont sure may care hunter biden right knows month smear campaign trump already admitted big issue please remember republicans masters made scandals 
joe's really lucky public seem care hunter think good answer got job say trump worse 
republicans best engage whataboutism bush sketchy military service record say least destroyed war hero opponent swift boat veterans truth in crooked hillary corruption secrets balancing trump inimitable sleaze think two weakest candidates general narrative biden used office land son lucrative undeserved job play nicely corrupt president sends daughter state missions gives law absurdly substantive policy portfolio sanders definitely major flaws leaning toward idea outsider status lack cloud protectionist trade history would probably help make stronger contender wi mi pa 
think roads suck grew oregon lived portland good years now i've lived states say bad 
watch fox news like lingo you describe societally funded healthcare etc free are things people want pay tax dollars yes that's argument make but calling dumb 
well grew lived long tell fact roads suck 
bill maher white supremacist what actual fuck high

yeah lived years child drive adult 
grew southern oregon lived portland years adult 
new campaign video democrats going trump bernie 
it explains reason sanders support dropping trying primary president obama railing establishment major senate endorsements painting sc african american voters low information angry rhetoric democratic agenda shows unwillingness compromise supporters mean spirited attacks candidates 
if tomorrow goes way polls say bernie needs drop from point he's trump's proxy 
that amy klobuchar sound bide hauntingly accurate my goodness effective ad 
he democrat point sowing discontent among another four years trump suits agenda better biden win strengthens argument radical next time around rather moderates possibly rest life 
bernie democrat hope warren choose join democratic socialists america believe capitalist 
solid ad stay look like race already bernie thought 
biden looks poised blowout tomorrow make sure still vote 
the comments lmao bunch sanders kids probably even vote spreading trump level fake news 
bet clip bernie meant point despite talk joe's gaffes vicious rumors supporters spread mental capacity plenty moments forgetfulness like repeatedly called cnn's wolf blitzer jake even corrected 
personally think could used first part ad skip second half people would understand message without antagonizing sanders 
like ad why even bring bernie aren attacking it confusing high road that said voting biden tomorrow 
bernie's attacks joe getting personal let's get vote button primary bernie damages biden like hillary 
support many bernie's views strongly disagree trying fragment party this help elect trump the children ripped parents put cages can't afford another years nor people trump's muslim ban 
love shifts clown music bernie section 
guy can't get single person who's ever worked endorse 
if tomorrow goes way polls say biden needs refuse debate otherwise engage bernie ignore begin campaign trump 
i'm riding couch voting sanders stay long thinks helps message there's lot folks far left side support mind chance express 
think even knows cant run he'll heart issues one would go scorched earth promote aoc feel like would invest much younger person ideas he'd endorsed warren campaigned hell least attack she probably could scenario bernie dropping health put pressure concerns biden they're around age thinking last shot inches away clyburn made endorsement everything quickly snowballed 
thank you put lipstick pig end day still 
think saw bernie replying repeating health care ad however went back look see 
years old sanders supporter sub part educate exactly biden realize likely win nomination vote case however like for someone against trump choosing lesser two evils know bernie lot young supporters kids believe whole heartedly message some us tired voting people delivering thing the system broken it needs rebuilt patched your comments lead truly drank kool aid sorry invade really trying understand way 
agree came away message joe dragging bernie admittedly way 
rotr joe c'mon he seemed fine dealing bernie's attacks without responding kind this bit disappointing honest 
agree what point is ad even needed 
we need stop attacking like bernie yeah sense irony 
think self defense attack hillary went soft bernie he hung long lot damage image about time someone called sanders 
yeah clips bernie would fine 
no trump softball excuse debate 
in case there's lot evidence suggest bernie narrow path winning tomorrow goes predicted see comparable bros saying somebody needs drop 
if cares country needs try win feasible come together get radicalized supporters democratic party it pushing support house senate races whatever wants 
bernie scratched scraped mud barbed wire uncle joe rode ice cream top gun sunglasses best snl cold open ever rewatch time remember good old days 
vote democrats ideals platform we spend way much weight one person 
do questions us add biden supporters also need chill name calling follow rotr 
since ask question why every sanders leaning sub seem much hatred everyone bernie that combined distribution discredited conspiracy theories probably pushes people away 
biden still supports lot ideals bernie wants help provide healthcare everyone make college affordable enough longer barrier education elect democrat justices decriminalize marijuana get children cages border repair relationship world stage fight climate change do support things 
ashotgunnamedmarcus i'll take word how familiar joe's actual policy plans i'd happy talk very much old thing 
easiest way see biden quit believing internet bullshit candidate base done best ruin reputation democratic party sway voters give damn think drank koolaid honestly party always disagree maybe one sucked fictional the entire liberal progressive say labels radical policies turned sanders group ignorant children insult others fuel arguments instead using facts 
if really acting good faith say we've influx trolls lately take look stickies there ton information sub joebiden com you also know ad strategy and sanders' campaign lead i'd hope run something similar it'd political malpractice likewise sanders spending lot energy running joe instead right it's politics finally candidate message unity threat like trump policy help many americans both candidates walk chew gum time 
yes candidates always want gain momentum running margin well biden start process healing party democrats gear general election 
i'm referring saying trump proxy 
vote whoever wins democratic nomination like feel good lol 
what best pro biden pitch if trying convince someone shot winning white house would say also joe going make real difference people how edit add thank answering engaging civil discussion 
speak everyone think may fire passion cause believed coupled seeing things absolutes way young people tend bernie seen best chance hard understand see we least older ones everything wants without major progressive democratic win congress that unlikely but seams legitimate passions his fight poor working class honest one he feel like politicians ever choose different in great personally hatred anyone running side exception system seems stand throat giving handouts billionaires corporations pay dime taxes as conspiracy theories maybe starting push far enough left tinfoil hat wearers the right problem years sure go eventually find anti alex jones lol 
support things think biden bring dignity presidency don get wrong anti joe pro bernie this still primary if takes gets nomination needs whatever make sure progressives young stay home like hillary vote others reach extreme folks party guy chosen need figure otherwise trump nation again 
actually familiar like but educating speak could message find questions 
going deny bernie supporters little top and sometimes things posted online place civil discussions trying decide nominee president but us talking joe describes differences he respectful factual it important let voters know real choice they believe believes better trump support wins nomination lot base young people prone letting emotions get best overall good thing passionate politics paying attention getting involved shame massage lost storm attack ads misguided efforts really great candidate offer worth another look that saying oh party historically ever evolving bad either 
is healing party ultimately irrelevant thought could left sanders part 
but focusing trump want attacks inside house stop 
think point they're making staying attacking joe trump's work agree could phrased less inflammatory way 
scotus nominations progress addressing climate change improving healthcare functioning justice department rational foreign immigration policy end corrupt amoral administration us history plenty feel good 
nancy pelosi make feel good personally hate stupid plans when get convention hunker write platform anyways joe malleable guy told suggested 
best elevator pitch would progressive president ever real chance passing legislation talks due experience ability reach across aisle personally think biggest difference makes revitalizing middle working class my favorite policy climate interwoven goal bring back manufacturing jobs industrial south midwest plants build clean energy sources https joebiden com also biden god willing able aca expand insurance every american whether end us get uninsured americans insured quickly possible as know bernie justice dems said happy public option passed fan give lot credit shift perception healthcare he really shifted generation view right tackle see uptick happiness bargaining power economically need stay dead job joe refines message paints vision better future people duped trump promises coal etc brings side and course glad open discussions let 
biden still progressive president we've ever he's running platform left obama clinton bernie shaky path victory despite appearance polling showing well vs trump the metrics see head propped substantially youth historically end even stating this exactly saw texas many thought would run away state problem vote said show polled never actually https www vox com policy politics bernie sanders electability moderates data needs historical level jump higher height reached last election match support losses according bigger engagement got african americans on top holds lead keys states lost regardless though similar odds win presidency year mind matters less downballot races last midterm house seats flipped blue wave single one endorsed candidate justice dem candidates putting means forcing defend deep purple districts even someone fairly leaning take congress red congress day progress towards values 
thanks response personally i've opinion podcast name quarantined sub qualifies left wing alex jones 
ah reading question trump biden bernie replied another comment i'm choosing as far disenfranchising progressives think fine warren campaigning keep mind reddit twitter terrible sample reality there's lot moderates who'd rather take term let country go socialism either way lost 
of course came teampete super tuesday i'm still wrapping head around things i'll best 
so last four years party working get republicans house senate seats changed whatever thought money loving anti bernie establishment claims because switch obama company preferring capitalist country always needed rid great president seems prefer radical left tell if democratic party different moderates still back candidates understand changing ideologies cultural aspects seen ever evolving come argument works today joe ago even dislike biden must knowledge someone pro 
we gotta rip bandaid get hillary let bernie stuff fester way long 
agree help trump roundabout way many things accusing proxy certain implications intentions think true good insinuate know meant assume people take 
you right counts take win rational thought oval office absolutely still swinging fences tho at least convention 
ok that might issue maybe registered independent identify democratic policies think elected officials vote right best people not party telling joe told help in fact exactly torn sanders warren they passionate fighters who truly believe selling at time understand need ability compromise get thing done but side isle budging matter we strong ugh grownup hard 
going keep reading joe ideas case ends nominee like armed enough facts try get people vote really paying attention bernie since hillary lost feel passionate the system working us needs serious rebuild think sanders would beat trump last time let hope biden wins nomination another four years unbearable right pushing party towards even nod his influence felt come also bloomberg campaign less winning making sure another discussion lol 
you know heard podcast last week assuming mean chapotraphouse listened sub lol now curious little scared exactly left wing alex jones would look like karl marx wearing pu hat handing clean needles outside rescue shelter vegan restaurant 
agree there lot polarized opinions also really good discussions people currently support different candidate still understand side end also think bernie ideas getting bad wrap word socialism often seen synonymous communism majority supporters believe expect see taxes used programs benefit country instead corporate hand outs war and wrong helping one another being kind fair reaching help someone standing throat we stronger together powers keeping us fighting amongst maybe someday rebrand something marxist 
meant historically speaking democratic party it used incredibly racist socially ignorant then thru decades evolved just like people including bernie and joe hold everything someone said years ago people learn opinions change what point living experience things going anything that called wisdom sure mean obama say voted thought served honor integrity pro believe message vote primary if happens win nomination general feel getting buried socialism tag communism think listen man truly give says see truth saying given shot found stating judging earlier comment bought supporters radical pubescent cry baby internet trolls but smaller number attention scream loudest and loud ones often dumbest bunch 
keep mind said point obviously know bernie hates trump call proxy perhaps nader would accurate way unless least drops vicious conspiracy type attacks he's saying lately focuses trying promote ideas getting joe adopt rather needless character assassination 
accusing trump proxy certain implications it's after super tuesday sander real tough spot win primary he would remaining states didnt but stayed race continued attack hillary left attacked right it weakened going general add repeated bs calls election rigged establishment lost early refused accept instead turned bullshit talking points disadvantage 
lol the biggest legislation countries history always co sponsored it takes decades timing we need left pull right gop boat conservative ideals more gop its like big ship guys bernie jim inhofe tugboats yanking opposite directions 
definitely man just reading knowledgeable ask think either bernie joe would win personally especially economy tanking less ideal response coronavirus right 
want get much detail hosts self described marxists purposefully work angry possible seem hate main stream democrats trump they also insist spreading conspiracy theories dnc joe's health etc recent episode even said biden elected we going die 
also think bernie ideas getting bad wrap word socialism often seen synonymous communism oh absolutely really wish sanders infatuation calling socialist accurate he's effectively made unelectable large portion voter base bonding term get feel done major damage chances even progressives changing generations american propaganda something change overnight pick battles 
think agreement history part terrible making point believe understand impression meant you correct people change turn politics culture message behind democratic party whether progressiveness devotion capitalist system protect working class always fdr well yes everyone racist turned around and clarify bernie trashed obama administration since referred evil establishment titles moderate wing that changed super tuesday released ad gave assumption would endorse when questioned said insider apparently clinton biden still touch socialist comment agrees communism hoping beat trump honestly percentage republicans hate vote someone either title electability worse help guy trashes go way defend already between fake video yesterday volunteers tweeted hiring advisors loyalty professionalism proven capable matter great ideas sound 
yeah agree the interesting comparison seen jeremy corbin he can't help fight party purity loyalty first completely forget actually needs win general anything little like trump moving left country moving right ends really bad 
yeah help trump he ego it 
like analogy hopefully bernie boat pull little harder long run 
like believe surrounded people would vote trump even watched set mothers fire it crazy facts seem matter point trumps policies directly hurt call libtard yes think really time alive 
wtf seen whole biden dementia thing places sad that unacceptable behavior anyone side place country supposed free fair elections said feel democratic leadership would much rather klobuchar buttigieg anybody bernie think see team player others which actually like he seams put people party appealing subscribe full marxist either maybe found podcast sun earlier expect taxes use programs benefit spent less war education healthcare better socialism getting bad wrap cast light communism people act evil way mean wrong helping one another we stronger together it definitely system allows die curable diseases afford treatment less term homeless veteran exists hoarding billions dollars personal wealth even person earth starving nonsensical sorry started rant little basically attacks candidates cool and happen need focus history beliefs make informed decisions based facts hopefully enough us november trump era finally 
exactly thank enjoyed conversation it everyday met civility granted intelligent debate respect opinions online often devolves primates throwing feces 
it bit nerve racking think i'd see elderly socialist get blown right wing nationalist goofy blonde hair twice one year 
that best we need bernie's omars aoc's here young mayor minneapolis hhh he shook democratic national convention kicked racist party later made civil rights legislation happen vp the aoc https youtu nwidiuvfm 
live lake county florida man total racist shit hole people openly white dude think know feels us left need unite joe right wing secret republican good lot great goals wants achieve bernie better spot biden potus dems we got come together make big things happen 
agree personal attacks shitty unfortunately characteristic whole election not bernie folk anyone active season early remember several supporter groups specifically name names horrific honorable mention third but need talk policy differences elevation lot time especially touch first things disagree miss do for example pretty much everyone say expect see taxes put use programs benefit people spent less war education healthcare we'd better i'm really sure point guess disappointed increasing degradation political discourse society 
ok you get seriously what wrong people rhetorical question lol 
remember bidenbro memes we need bring back 
yes request biden buttigieg bro memes 
think need new bidenbro meme generation joe pete 
now gonna pete biden memes 
oh loved my favorite one joe said would boobytrap white house like home alone 
admit chuckling i'm huge harry potter geek 
looks like sub got taken malarkey unfortunately 
when pete dropped found old biden meme stash one things made feel okay 
subbed enjoy memes better sanders ones anyway 
hate term bro progressive tag berniebro makes think toxic attitude many sanders people ashamed when hear bidenbro biden equivalent support know different context 
what need viral biden meme 
get still laughed loud want 
check sidebar subreddit info click edit pick one change whatever want that's made mine 
can't quite seem i'm sure wrong 
can't either i'd love betjoe o'biden flair 
national nbcnews wsj poll biden sanders gabbard 
at point establishment voters lol 
think people realizing dangerous years trump we also seeing willing risk impeachment tarnish biden he crushing swing states red purple bernie phenomenon voting prospect another yrs clinton bush 
care state level polls but still good credible pollster well 
wow just saw wsj what amazing turnaround some political forums counted biden nevada keep telling nope heard heart democratic party people trolling thinking crazy they posted felt sorry needed drop knew people sc mi wanted uncle joe president nice ring folks 
bernie's campaign strategy tailored towards winning vote hoping everyone else would stay field super tuesday beyond once happen blew face plan moving forward had pivoted inclusive message nh probably different establishment dnc rigged something 
that kind democratic voters way saying we seen enough 
bs drop instead making people stand line spreading disease vote 
at time clinton leading bernie sanders nationally points joe biden 
sanders closer tulsi biden lol 
bernie points behind biden tulsi really falling apart 
am one thinks tulsi insanely hot 
she's doubled peak polling numbers 
know joking wish media us would stop reporting by simply mentioning gives campaign oxygen the poll anyone's report could easily said biden sanders neither candidate 
tulsi supporter dc voted primaries yet donate campaign early sanders similar issues overall ready support biden november needed 
bernie stans love diminish voters vote candidate when minority state support proof he's best minorities but biden they're boomers conservatives moderates etc voters can't possibly actually think better country it's always conspiracy 
establishment really always meant voters 
yeah lot bernie support anti clinton um reasons we'd gladly vote woman like elizabeth warren ok 
red states wouldn't go far yet 
this means state polls insane us 
rated couple better ones nonetheless good pollster probably little bit higher reality still result 
she ivanka trump want either anywhere near executive branch 
she lookin like cruela deville 
no but hot bad ideas 
think main draw really long time mostly she's bit milf guess 
please leave crap like stay substantial poltical discussion sub 
mean i'd like fair running she 
same met very nice humble not sure happened towards end comments committed early especially town halls 
they're brainwashed low information voters know 
this line thought i've always plain weird mean voting therefore voters thus people need vote candidate you court call names show zero respect fellow citizens think going real problem progressive movement forward if keep alienating potential constantly belittling choices ever successful national elections they realize eventually right 
sexism played part sure based polling last couple weeks going back midterms possible elizabeth warren misread political winds thought democratic electorate lot left leaning actually she wanted occupy bernie lane running joe 
actually think warren would better shot she'd run course that's hindsight never going 
that supported bernie clinton wildly unpopular choice 
i'm wondering there's internal research shows dissatisfied republicans voting biden november know circle he's least moderate 
especially since upcoming states favorable joe 
the months propaganda going lower numbers strategic demographics 
team joe way but yes ivanka tulsi objectively hot or subjectively guess 
from pov we like different types people respect 
lot people kamala booker gillibrand beto rush framing left assuming bernie's majority actual answer clinton extremely unpopular even within party the still shifted bidens platform evidence skeptical radical policy proposals general election biden pete handful others figured little early benefitted 
he's least moderate this might play state like az nc even ut seems far fetched ky nd 
higher polls averages just unlikely right others wrong 
that make okay post shit comments 
right place nice discuss trashy comments could zero 
sure think name game right covering ground bernie attract rs biden might 
just ignore one comment move you choose let ruin affect experience

provided biden shoot someone th avenue something equivalently bad joe say supports oh he's shotgun 
this certified malarkey free sub 
think easier people like joe bernie likeable better speaker less ideas 
really successful hit job modern politics fox news made radioactive 
feeling bernie hang next debate criticism joe significantly reduced he read writing wall understands party needs unity going november division 
guys let call unity coming try respectful 
exactly let focus winning general elect democrats every single office federal government we fight policy differences control everything 
if joe's nominee let's us dragonball lend spirit votes 
pete buttigieg at debates you would see joe biden talking stage hands lot us pacing 
predict big things pete guy 
pete voice makes stress flutter away love way talks 
pete took responsibility instead selfish staying campaign like sanders respect 
still prefer guy i'm totally honest but he's right joe similar rhyming styles it's called character mind voting biden super tuesday board general 
kamala klobuchar veep pete secretary state 
bros said joe nuts pacing empty stage candidates writing extra notes using toilet interval second last debate folks saying hiding biden let bus minutes time the debates hours intense pressure dude owned two without taking break write new guys arguing total bad faith 
remember bernie bros call villain the dude literally got harvard scholarship writing admiration nothing says starting revolution like eating youngest progressive alive and gentrify south bend it possibly decrepit city america seen if sq ft factory sat dormant half century turned tech center gentrification progress but rat memes almost swayed back do think wondering attacks backfired this guy voice progressivism years 
oh missed bright eyed well rested pete it good see vibrant there time towards end wanted someone make chasten tea laundry took nap love man 
whoa i've told reason pete dropped secret pact establishments forcing he comes tv says opposite just tell truth is allowed 
wow pete super great really like way complimented joe biden it makes feel inspired november nominee the fact calm pressure means good white house 
he jimmy kimmel thursday guest host 
lmao rewind morning realized halfway interview stopped actually listening anyone said absentmindedly basking back tv apparently pete buttigieg safe place 
his voice makes automatically trust 
pete calm guy it one reasons gravitated he literally anti trump smart cares facts science super empathetic 
same even though i've biden stan since day pete always second choice pete for 
nothing wrong saying he'll day obama got intro dnc could similar pete 
pete un ambassador rhodes scholar speaking languages he negotiate new global currency wants 
pete vp klob secstate kamala ag 
fun fact pete appointed secretary state would youngest person sos age iirc edmund randolph one history he nd 
there people much qualified secretary state pete think noteworthy foreign policy experience maybe different cabinet spot one 
kam ag klob vp we send pete massive world wide clean mission 
you mean first openly gay president 
thinking chief staff un would amazing he speaks official languages needs take time add russian mandarin 
vp needs gov senator needs able reliably bring state along usually swing candidate would struggle 
he'd youngest person almost anything they'd want tbh how young un ambassador that's another one might never dipped 
right one never knows looking james buchanan https www washingtonpost com opinions pete buttigieg wouldnt americas first gay president eb de story html 
today learned six official un languages 
agree picking vp based election strategy it needs someone step time run president biden term ends pete best person job 
people keep saying vp needs bring state idk true biden really specific obama what expand enthusiastic base if candidate great demo could chose someone help turnout knocked qualification experience pick cover gap bit youth problem he half decent suburban women better also people criticized joes overall energy vpete helps in early states pete highest conversion rate former republicans voting flipped trump counties anyone else iowa overall compliments lot weaknesses know unrealistic choosing veep voter 
how young youngest un ambassador regardless think secretary state carries bit clout 
buchanan clearly guy liked alone now lincoln 
makes bit sense remember un formed allied powers ww original ones documents printed chinese french russian english spanish arabic came later 
the best person entire country take mayor south bend indiana like enthusiasm 
oh definitely way pete'd vp sos sure think skills excel pretty much foreign affairs role general i'm biased 
except ten years lived male roommate 
one totally okay pete learning russian call russians language tbh 
haha fair say seriousness performance election moderate joe win significant amount votes worry putting vp candidate part primary might thoroughly vetted 
it actually normal male friends sleep room time one historian forgot name said lincoln gay theory reflects society's obsession sex mindset actual people 
does know languages use cyrillic alphabet if it'd pretty easy russian particularly complicated language verb conjugation starters but would rough he's learning whole new 
pete super impressive bright future vp need women senator harris klob likely vetted pull votes makes tactical sense deliver mn ia wi mi without biden anything competent african american side swipe help ca btw win 
no verb conjugation mandarin either it really bad language seeking learn read able use analogies locals learning cyrillic alphabet usually spending afternoon takes new periodic reinforcement 
not far he's ever said minored arabic first time picked new alphabet 
the thing think biden deliver wi mi still good choice optics joe strong candidate pete needs vp he make connections already back channel chief staff best pick pete lets get mentored alot gain management experience we pretty safely assume woman just sure yet needs reinforcement complementary person particularly age continues brought 
you probably right really wish election strategy part we see soon enough 
woops sorry guess comment applies theextremistmoderate's 
tried learning russian back still remember lot alphabet one practice makes impossible retain 
think pete people going disappointed it already looks like disconnected biden machine there tons competent worked decades used jobs chief staff to pick cos would asking new guy work best man childhood best friend want makes sense gaining exposure do know obama's not good way build unless one trumps road kills 
the meme is solid let's state big freaking deal biden's turning obama level numbers maybe even this elder statesmen calling return normalcy us we're hopeful gets 
jr holy shit even sr biden 
and sanders supposed well at point staying like tulsi gabbard it hurts legacy 
the state michigan says malarkey 
hell yes turn incredible also compare county map sanders vast majority counties mi seems like people really hated hrc this bodes well general 
what rotr tulsi gabbard could hurt legacy point 
think rationale staying bit longer influence pushing progressive policy convention 
this one results revolution wish could voted pete part il 
it's hard look right candidate's name vote someone else 
thank now go get ice cream cone 
floridian warren will rewarding strawberry ice cream later 
pete definitely back it's really 
isn illegal take pictures polling booth like federal offense 
pete supporter accidentally voted first using paper ballots go back ask another ballot sucks can't vote guy good country and big role play future 
sat moment looking longingly pete's name ballot voting joe time move forward win era 
looks like better selection tbh 
how y'all able take pics we wer told put phones lobby building even got voting booth room 
because revolutions never yield results 
results means trump one time blue 
lol weed shirt voting democratic candidate furthest right 
it really know want right thing give petty vote full confidence able finally pete future 
covid rights activists moment talk electing trump 
what policy similarities warren biden 
not quite least far i'm aware it's illegal take picture someone else's vote advocate interference someone's since op taken photo endanger anyone privacy sense already voted one buy giving money insert name however would imagine worst punishment receive 'don't again' fine technically florida prohibits kind could prosecute ever prosecuted the law unclear states it depends state this understanding 
sure took phone pocket immediately some people still air pods voting 
the corporate canidate give us results not corporations viva biden 
if biden manages successfully implement even half platform great nobody go gulag 
weed shirt sure wearing shamrock st patrick day 
yes heard correct i'm advocating expand rights covid trump candidate committed freecovid 
maybe many bernie warren people switch candidates much common policy the executive branch supposed face put world maybe like biden warrens charisma briefly supported primary switching glad still senate draft legislation 
warren progressive ideology like bernie actual plans biden zero indication he'll pay anything except said raise middle class taxes solid concrete tackle climate change healthcare criminal justice reform virus etc even wish pragmatic better fantasy land that's one reasons even though number choice she's 
have actually looked proposals bernie's platform i'm shocked believe there's path getting laid plainly smarmy curious 
since polling people openly saw anything think reprimanded 
the man states terrible funding campaign offices support people 
mildly deep fried extra meme zest 
wish saw sunglasses joe often the look suits 
throw sticker garbage bin quarter lint enough 
you forgot save later candies can't let go waste want caramel 
it's shades the candidates put money commercials joe biden spend frugally bought 
name recognition goes long way 
scott sterling wait wrong sub

standing something realistic also goes long way

now boy pete i'm gonna need someone aggressively taking bernie every front like joe see fire 
yep last time sanders lost aka landslide loss still repeatedly called ignoring votes african americans latinos majority women deeming king er nominee anyway joe need bring what member latino community supporting guy demanded ignored overturned last even republicans never insane enough call every remaining candidate hammering fact endlessly 
typical bs bernie fucking establishment 
this honest statement considering bernie sanders present amendment dnc trying get rid superdelegates promptly refused when people say supported mean compromised reached tied primaries result always fail bring original 
bernie endorsed hillary path victory aka secured delegate 
you find folks candidates saying many things let's focus less supporters 
think that's style strategy better worse he's always playing long game knows need never trumpers independents went johnson last time means saying things like believes work republicans congress blech smart 
the question room sway away rotr would joe accept little malarkey 
good luck taking trump someone can't even cite declaration independence 
how many blacks latinxs bush ignore took white house losing popular vote or trump matter this comment really hold 
ranked choice system would way better although still advocate range voting that said see real benefit started using national level one election parties ticket 
agree superdelegates go unfortunately tad devine bernie's campaign manager deep ties manafort helped put superdelegate system years ago thsoe problem take sanders also tried game last time overturn landslide loss hoping sway voters make nominee think anyone upset majority party chooses far that's i'd like ranked choice voting even important diverse states mirror first

sanders mathematically eliminated may would argue long he endorse july two weeks convention edit you could ad nauseam rules time numbers boiled regardless system used proposed using https imgur com izlur png the argument involving delegates number events conducted endorsement this criticism martin o'malley tweeted earlier month twitter martinomalley status quite sure made far appearances hillary clinton bernie ever and never insisted private leer jet go campaign oh pa wi nor bloggers paid russian television attack throughout general 
sanders said debates candidate plurality delegates get nom complete last cycle wanted switch convention 
disagree enjoying watching pete expose bernie stage want getting away hard questions without 
rotr mean can't call malarkey see pete stage showed you confront deliver breathe smile everytime almost gave bernie heart attack got taste bernie's true colors need personally 
no joe made clear malarkey that means none accepting even little malarkey point would betray everything built campaign 
coming pete would highly appreciate adoption rotr 
wow smooth burn buddy you got anymore came lit material you're cooking kale 
lost electoral vote proven almost year later press buried story largely they technicalities never call overturning votes slave states constitution created 
he never said super delegates back whoever state represent even would go clinton 
that exactly saying chance tried get rid since stance later nomination appeal delegates responsible and end endorsing hillary 
the difference superdelegates pledged primaries even began ever news cycle filled no hope for sanders to overcome such deficit in delegates first public votes cast compromise lower number wait voice people heard voting so yeah think that's fair whether bernie biden ask echo represent 
still follow but text banker pete would like malarkey pass maybe week please 
range voting method voters essentially asked score candidate it's hard explain better website really good job explaining https rangevoting org once scores taken highest average wins since restrictions candidates lot freedom voter might example give favorite perfect party mediocre opposing low with ranked choice ballot divide much like least democrat republican would first second choices even though probably democrats far republicans the idea make many people happy possible also avoiding making anyone excessively unhappy edit here's summary exactly range tries accomplish bayregdum html 
if presume campaign manager speaks basically https www npr org sanders says superdelegates key winning nomination now argue merits weaver continued and role rubber stamp pledged delegate count really needed they're supposed exercise independent judgment think lead party forward victory 
the difference fewer delegates hillary 
you want sander's supporters call hypocrisy us 
it seems manager stating purpose super delegates created first place did stand gain flawed system yeah either way kind silly say bernie favor history actively disliking attempt change

kinda everyone slinging shit warren i'm watching cnn can't even count number times they've specifically referred disappointing like never supporter though like kind making mad know that's tangent talking pissing night 
if actually care type person joe check interview years ago colbert part https youtu opvaec wxws xwmmpytjrk he's good man would make president surround advisors 
his plans hbcus plan education general actually good public option want single payer elimination private insurance lol manchin sinema etc falling line feel like there's lot historical revisionism people young remember fucking hard fight aca cost several blue dog democrats seats fuck lieberman life role stopping public option 'carbon tax repeal citizens united vacate pot convictions end death penalty federal minimum wage trade honestly big one understand problems nafta tpp free trade can't put cat back bag globalization stay with could least leverage china and frankly downballot major issue progressives fl even denouncing bernie valid point expressed tone deaf way worst time election worry build coalitions work others fact barbara lee went kamala probably progressive politicians three alarm fire i'm joe think delusional try republicans bernie's protesting va change manchin's mind equally keeps winning depicting renegade dem ugh ad shot piece paper meant represent obama's policies he'd love organize protest use advertisement lastly end day specifics it's reason drawn warren first shifting vague that's concern forgot add turn touting he's going beaten thought far registered dems nv ia nh the place record turnout va decisively biden 
curious well policy positions excite biden supporters 
thank request comrade errl dabbingtons said word yet 
probably around https imgur com jpg tbh find approving lot comments removed indiscernible reason 
picking biden running mate masterstroke obama he complimented obama's weaknesses seen prophets oriole young inexperienced national level politics able connect working class white voters better could that absolutely brilliant pick and paid mccain went opposite way picked undercut strengths whereas complemented real perceived 
voted warren today knew matter genuinely like pete would've second choice vote bernie culture i'm way interested competent person exact positions survive office you'll get major bills stars align congressional support give ones nerds give policy wonks people want hang care issues i'll take al gore hillary clinton elizabeth hopefully future election stuff done help others great parties 
yeah remember richardson edwards rubio kasich getting much shit staying race warren 
i'm really trying dick i'll listen videos said super generic statement what biden offering bernie 
appreciate response seriously reading holy shit president repealed citizens united would huge win agree specifics slightly lacking also think candidates release large documents people read bernie tax plan pay medicare for all pages bet already much lot sadly like see details since every study done determine overall cost place findings 
minimum wage aca medicaid expansion public option ban death penalty vacate marijuana convictions climate energy plan includes nuclear carbon tax crucial ipcc recommended parts getting zero emissions big plusses also he's got support democrats congress actually pass policies divisive independent never misses opportunity attack downballot success beat trump 
in addition things commenters mentioned i'm also really idea person years functional white house experience one try repair train wreck current admin half positions government even filled biden knows way around job already significantly smaller learning curve option 
that makes think pete andrew yang could great contrast joe 
know mean warren line best ideologically left scale seriously awe policy wonkness is word wonkity something like 
if already rough go point warren would pete much reasons 
right like get underperforming lot people extent several dropped bernie getting curb stomped yet keep cycling back warren like omg disappointing specific word it may stupid hang woman notice really bug 
he's offering pipe dreams every single policy position biden positive change better achieved and agree pretty much policies bernie writing check office cash among ton reasons list people i'd excited vote november oh joe supporter ever called rat twitter pro pete 
get point specifics also press warren went praised plans slammed my big fear going emails biden bernie nominee i've already seen happen twice past two days the framed encouraging crowd boo amy fact complimented told cut five second clip taken context fire retweeted blue check journalists tweets devoid situation it seemed play angry narrative during speech tonight wife sister switched sides behind ruckus crazy dairy protestors he turned around expecting instead saw made crack well people took five running confused even time usa today etc retweeting played dementia gotcha videos bs see full it's depressing really we're fall trap shit media goes anyway nice talking wins nomination vote 
increase capital gains tax repeal citizens united get rid mandatory minimums private prisons year college free boost teacher pay corporate taxes go directly infrastructure build rural broadband pull back tariffs reduce malarkey emissions washington dc

i'll accept wonkness in perfect world probably lean bernie believe change done step leave revolutions past thanks they rarely end well 
yeah needed senate i'm happy stay convention prove point bernie 
oh think there's doubt lot gendered nature 
agree overall biden good person he's said debatable things past could question take think man obviously better trump lot bernie's plans sound paper would actually able come fruition mcconnell already many bills sitting desk there's shitty supporters every camp vocal they're likely among youngest respect reasons pro hope democratic party unite single candidate election whether bernie

one blessings hillary former first lady she already 
think like year two leaving office 
they request obviously thought okay 
think way would easy job stick two servicemen front jail cell set 
presidents get lifetime anymore think changed either last coverage first expiration date meh somebody look edit years president however mentioned back https www cbsnews com news obama restores secret service former presidents gave 
actually think trump hate having someone watching every second means grabbing pussy it shady shit bet regrets winning rest life 
this problem corrupt oligarchy establishment politicians the secret service going use nepotism hire jill biden agent 
yeah hold signs protesting milk 
no wonder bernie protesters targeted first 
he already got nickname jill 
glad adult children former presidents get dumb dumber deserve 
well know convicted ny state charges serve time fed pen secret service agents 
heard does anyone source know refuse secret service get lifetime protection 
jill too kind weird nickname former vp

chasten style glasses would look good 
fl house pensacola home blue angels cast pete vote biden today marked joe ballot heart 
also dem majority congress get legalized they need calm haha

ha great see there's crossover 
and used glasses hope make comeback 
agree gotta update prescription next week style wanted get thank 
i'd rather country torn apart war two populist demagogue getting high white house's permission lot lower priority 
well that's flat wrong considering joe wants decriminilize marijuana 
that's thought gained trifecta new jersey 
oh gosh thought like good point convincing you've good job fact retire early talking politics internet just stop right forever congratulations 
from halfway criminal justice policy https joebiden com justice decriminalize use cannabis automatically expunge prior convictions biden believes one jail as president decriminalize and support legalization medical purposes leave decisions regarding recreational states reschedule schedule ii drug researchers study positive negative impacts 
you mean ones biden wants release jail 
would like take opportunity thank principled pothead 
question joe mean exactly decriminilization i've heard wants make entirely states basically federal stance is true because would rescheduling decriminilization making still illegal law smaller penalties thanks legit asking bernie supporter trying learn biden case goes way 
weed used weapon minorities since made illegal https www independent co uk voices comment war drugs tool state oppression html the tm darling conservative policy makers as democrats assumed would loath help republicans right wing agenda 
is least decriminalized edit looked ballot year 
do want talk voting record his ever changing positions how proven lies debate stage remember he obama god hope wrong 
biden one put first place wtf 
so more go next day crime 
lol thank best compliment i've ever gotten 
the things wrong cults it appeals people's base emotions removes reality tells people group good worthy respect it's anyone hostile attacked berated populist leaders erode systems rise power usurping much influence possibly look putin they're process changing constitution remain president indefinitely trump talked thing if bernie going pass next decade trying rude statistically unlikely makes longer difficulty imagining world full support bust ers populists rule law get person solve problems facing us you give save sorry i'm self isolating high af response rambling think got point across somewhere 
this already posted thread go decriminalize use cannabis automatically expunge prior convictions biden believes one jail as president decriminalize and support legalization medical purposes leave decisions regarding recreational states reschedule schedule ii drug researchers study positive negative impacts you find halfway criminal justice policy https joebiden com justice 
he wants decriminilize marijuana expunge prior records convictions leave federal government way states want legalize it's major issue platform he's gone detail specifics decriminilization kind imply rescheduling imagine would happen 
thankfully joe wants decriminalize people stop getting thrown jail 
it's ballot democratic state legislature pass bill 
please enlighten would go jail decriminalizes 
gotcha assume he's using term interchangeable since wants people jail if gets office hope least fired smoking free time 
legalization refers repeal abolishment laws prohibit use sale possession cannabis establishment new legislation permits certain conditions restrictions decriminalization reduction criminal penalties imposed remains illegal unregulated state what points decriminalization cop still pull herd fines misdemeanors it's solution typical moderate compromise biden gave game going gold 
you summed biden campaign one word thanks

candidate endorsed biden mathematically think bernie stands much chance getting nomination trump many republicans gleefully pointed would destroy ballot possibly even allowing gop take back house moderate believe government provide heath care need best suited abolishing private insurance forcing everyone plan way go right talks wanting expand aca individual state marketplaces ambetter life saver worked retail idea rather poor senate record including gun control complain job time suite seem get perks made ceo tomorrow put water cooler plans action like defending soviet russia cuba venezuela say communist sure rose colored glasses subject does come phrases it omelette du fromage absolutely problem income inequality country appreciate lectured multimillionaire owns three palatial homes cost one well reach average american worker bet damn fine wine cave least important reason influential policies age supporters back curious ideas bros completely soured deal alt maga hat wearing redneck spouting sean hannity latest conspiracy pizzagate iran whatever another smarmy condescending bro tells know nothing corporate shill little bitch billionaires go mention anything remotely negative politics see first hand comes marketing brand area failed spectacularly second choice end day

welcome appreciate sharing thinking lot resonates someone also that's progressive policy views ultimately want real engagement complicated reality actually getting things done understanding need build coalitions 
welcome aboard bernie populist think we've enough populism white house 
agree when comes passing progressive policy feel like bernie asks much inability work democrats senate means big bold revolutionary demands might even get past less republicans biden trust ability make incremental progress solidify obama's legacy something build it's easier single payer popular public option already rather starting zero 
this intellectual warren voter right good analysis really like bernie handling critical media care st amendment despise politicians threaten 
pete biden supporter thanks much helping put words logic around feeling campaigns

the best part team joe nobody asking hate anyone change beliefs fit mold trying one showing radical theh everyone valued accepted bring table i'm excited honest coalition he's building represents 
welcome thank support we glad 
warren shot rankings detailed transition plan towards medicare all include public option bill the reaction many bernie supporters call traitor acknowledging immediately passing impossible telling that want end but see possible without intermediate step and seem care amazing hope welcome 
thanks insight that's viewed warren basically progressive bernie without uncompromising populist approach as pete supporter agenda still seemed little bit unwieldy appreciate tried make policy proposals reflect complexities world actually loved anti corruption plan anything candidate proposed ultimately medicare made choose know dialed back time point already found much liked switch hope role next administration though wicked smart experienced brings needed empathy sharing thoughts welcome team biden amy beto anybody got better name 
glad those exactly reasons stopped supporting sanders even though voted biden may align warren he'll definitely meet half way lot issues offer nuanced leadership 
completely agree i'm pete supporter warren number two hell like my fear bernie drove way anything else tbh cheers sorry loss know bad feels much hope fire behind someone suddenly see die fantastic candidate honestly still struggle would better potus occasion 
very solid analysis issues hope find good group folks let's win thing 
all excellent reasons wouldheave voted warren generalwithout second hesitation whereas voodoo votingfor sanders would difficult their policies might similar buti trust warren's judgement when heard criticized ivy league professor sent good that's something criticize someone and line biden's saddened campaign sunk honest especially skates dishonest better world biden last two standing see vigorous debate policy substance we party country need debates sadly going election ashtray welcome aboard happy us 
welcome went back forth liz joe pete voted warren totally ridin' biden bernie years ago later became turned reasons listed 
nice when move warren's camp 
warren supporter without second thought biden train same bernie policy wise but biden someone need now 
im boat agree pretty much everything said 
welcome aboard as beto guy i'm probably progressive majority people joe camp think spot the thing sold bernie really good theory case gets policies passed senate map favorable supermajorities needs win coming together taking next steps your right place 
fairly certain articulated exactly came biden warrens camp relation bernie would points also think joe lot really important international relationships best plug play foreign policy president could get distinct impression aside climate rather isolationist need 
as pete supporter proudly voted warren last week totally agree everything said biden amazing vp president bernie keep fight establishment democrats thing presidency right place i'm sure he'll go back independent election done 
thank i'm also warren refugee lurking today trying mull options left biden policy hesitated support bernie lot things sit right many mentioned seems want blow system people like wanted reform within and feel black white attitude sink trump november still concerns excite base enough beat bigger 
welcome most analysis meshes the one thing saw different personally warren medicare to appeared refused explain anything debates combined lack detailed foreign policy proposals contrasted biden strength area straightfoward manner inspirational rhetoric america see candidate lead switch support november switched castro september february 
agree would emphasize good process actually important policy what mean rather back someone seems comparatively modest goals clear achieve amazing far reaching provide real way get think that's something former pete supporter share common appreciate joe understanding coalition building said 
yes absolutely i've seeing whole lot bernie supporters lately warren taken healthcare away children makes angry healthcare big deal opinion anyone supporting democrat want take but move needle need win back senate work democrats right 
this times populism never think takeaway 
preach never voted populist wonder bull china shop would worked nope good 
yep i'm hoping current populist peacefully leaves office loses election other countries best luck article https www theatlantic com ideas archive hard data populism bolsonaro trump according research governments deepened corruption eroded individual rights inflicted serious damage democratic institutions here formed list we selected leading peer reviewed journals political science sociology regional studies identified articles published subject well leaders linked vetted potential case study consulting country experts populist working definition united two fundamental claims elites outsiders work interests true people since populists voice nothing stand way ultimately parties power across today giving us ability settle theoretical debate tension democracy rigorous empirical global scale first time the results alarming populists highly skilled staying pose acute danger in fact percent stepped lost free fair elections another vacated high reached term limits but left dramatic circumstances impeached forced resign database remain day 
doubt unintellectual warren voter they wicked smart caring 
got banned bernie sub saying able get passed not bad plan pass didn't even realize scrolling 
anybody got better name the union i've listening battle cry freedom loop since last night 
feel like us pete warren supporters similar 
this really good way express idea i'd struggling articulate thank 
oooh yes wow you put finger exactly have spending last several months imprinting highly incisive politician something 
think both definitely matter i'm also warren supporter would never say dont care warren's progressive vision i'll bernie lacks ability wield process effectively biden values on top lot easier sway stances certain issues make peace friendship democratic party members congress 
end day pete warren close together year policy frequently focused second iteration plans acknowledged there'd phase somehow made progressive moderate according media tone primary difference pragmatic first 
now hear john mullany never bad thing there horse hospital 
bernie fans said wanted get money politics they got wish last night 
aaaaaand makes bros invent conspiracies rather seeing charm aptitude established reputation joe 
it worked states last night that's terrible plan moving forward 
what's wrong grassroots campaign funded supporters 
fact he's unpopular everyone jumped ship anyone trying diss biden love think bernie's lack appeal 
fully aware at end day meme just trying laugh little showing strength dependency moderate base once field thinned biden job got much easier 
nothing saying biden need coin take states like mn spent field offices 
he multiple super tuesday states despite never going respective field offices spending 
not case biden campaign last leg single ground office multiple super tuesday states it joementum bernie outspent huge margin enough 
it kind makes sad democracy 
you honestly uninformed know biden superpac support it great night joe let honest ok 
all says money votes history legislative success important voters this is great for democracy 
ok zoomer last time checked voter turnout higher ever young people bernie promised bring communities joe biden fought successfully protect throughout career there nothing like receipts angry rhetoric much 
my point responsible success he polling incredibly low comeback south carolina that nothing pac money it moderate field getting smaller bernie heavily campaigned visited super tuesday wins biden offices visits multiple winning states 
first almost fucking second get wrong voting joe gets nom but hillary less voter turnout obama rockstar youth cool older moderate voters bernie right one thing sure need historic beat trump can joe make you enough ok you need kind enthusiasm put dem top this meme help that saying punching downwards bunch starry eyed kids want future adults leading lead example the way fellow progressives act sometimes appalling passionate show us how its done boomer 
this two edged sword tho good thing national infrastructure it people ready get rid trump able win in normal year evil repub biden would trouble 
it's meme dude chill were welcoming former supporters that's cool thing big tent biden ask stop loving bernie vote 
starry eyed folks would actually vote this pretense loudest truly ones care engaged 
and expect real change biden i'll vote nominee alternative party outright criminal organization embodied flag bearer talks big tent needs votes we see really progressives ask go beyond cleaning trump's mess 
bernie delegates behind biden took night much everyone making you still need us voted general beat trump also far people show election primary 
how troll because agree literally trying find common ground people want this trump win second term 
in joe biden moderates well obama left 
looking back trying get healthcare passed obama extreme centrist he even wanna jump pushing lgbtq rights biden supported 
preach and he's gotten even progress since publication ad namely housing plan warren bankruptcy bernie inspire free college families earning less 
feel free check post history bernie bro since back cycle huge buttigieg supporter fully behind biden deserves lot credit considered moderate especially people like pete warren occasionally tagged moniker in gave overton window us swift long overdue kick left brought many ideas previously radical mainstream political conversation public option healthcare plan provides universal coverage compromise america that's positive progress the moderate candidate supports minimum wage college americans aggressive climate policy includes carbon tax dividend fuck yeah seeing actual progressive policies marketed way palatable even appealing older generations sit near middle spectrum awesome type platform defeat trump trumpism much sliding giving cover turnout numbers give hope might actually able november 
thank wish msm point beginning 
yes and ok just sayin 
hopefully biden get caught social media attention used focused bernie warren the country whole far left twitter reddit makes look like 
bidens campaign obamas campaign virtually identical updated ideals based current events 
thats easy obama barely even left 
looking back trying get healthcare passed obama extreme centrist woah wait second i'm glad joe running he's way shape form the berniebros may normalized interpretation untrue invented characterization whole cloth needed label hillary clinton people kept accurately pointing worked progressive ran president nation's politics moved left since mean context office matter characterize and gay marriage thing that's another common berniebro narrative strips away nuance events transpired if come fully favor likely hurt chances win case we'd gotten mccain clearly worse lgbtq issues set issue publicly it'd caused controversy actually acceptance 
mean bit tail wagging dog situation obama run far centrist campaign could win party nomination help move everything much progressive place time left 
agreed democrats moving left obama good thing 
think liberal legislation wanted republicans got house anything could aca 
it's tough say he deal unprecedented levels obstruction carrying weight first black president history likely felt undue pressure compromise seen ineffective that said clear competent took job seriously applied morality best allowed 
from i've seen obama biden agreed support gay rights later let slip early came back 
obama extreme centrist he even wanna jump pushing lgbtq rights biden supported there's marriage issue signed matthew shepard act update federal hate crime law include protections gender sexual orientation identity disability repeal don't ask tell left fantastic record comes https www pinknews co uk ways barack obama changed world lgbt 
agree somewhat read really interesting article try find written older black activist hated idea bernie get credit pushing new ideas others years she cited various high level people caught traction made country ready accept also saw whoopie goldberg articulate well 
derogatory names bernie supporters earn support biden trump win maybe consider spreading word stop slandering voters 
obama's sidekick wants us trust 
accept losses move you happy salty party moving left 
indeed while bernie may take credit several progressive policies supporters gatekeep term hillary clinton championed universal healthcare back newt gingrich made life goal run propaganda adopted green deal let forget ed markey put forward and parts tom steyer plan gun control he nra pockets became politically inconvenient ubi andrew yang deserves hell elizabeth warren much better pragmatic practical versions every idea 
if want stop calling 'bro' maybe fascist 
c'mon get not everything extreme bernie supporter said taken back biden supporters realize need side there's name calling that's important

biden sanders gains popularity warren drops reuters ipsos poll 
who woulda thunk demonizing candidate similar views along considerable number passionate supporters could backfire also weaponizing sexism homophobia racism forms bigotry attack candidates demographics give support sanders full shit talking like toxic every single person expressing political opinions online aligned bernie almost certainly harassed including death threats lots soviet communist references 
the thing sanders people understand they thought opposition cult leader due policies toxicity candidate giving progressives end goals 
dates mar spread biden the pollster rating fivethirtyeight 
hate sam seder tonight chris hayes talked lesser two evils biden vs sanders really enough crap 
checked still vs majority list chances biden getting plurality mean 
called stupid multiple times brothers turned candidate these people comprehend hostile hurting helping never vitriol yang sub started infiltrating amy subs just venture cesspool politics like 
agreed decorum respectability must come first even policy we compassion everyone medicare how kindness i'm former warren supporter happy vote biden 
really loved her policies hurt helped imo 
former warren voter like joe supporting bernie it likely get nomination promise comments make fuck ton harder volunteer donate there place campaign vision say activist not member cult this becoming bad sanders subs comes insulting intelligence motivations 
well never actually endorsed progressive that may play factor 
used really like sam certain point seemed people show wanted mad actually accomplish anything 
joebiden feature links website please submit unreliable extremely biased sources bot action performed automatically contact moderators subreddit message compose questions concerns 
agree carville's take she pretty perfect unity candidate debacle 
at end day decision fact matter lot bernie's supporters incredibly viritolic opponents no think every one way large enough frustrating needing vent if browsing joebiden likely meet people many places go hopefully understand rather thinking blanket insult bernie 
idk she fight worth fighting candidates prior revision plan and pretty defensive deflected incoming attacks making something tough added unnecessary comments involving republican talking points 
think poor political instincts she could made critical error juncture 
there enough places people bash left wing party happily posted since joe announced candidacy shared things like it quickly become place talk blindly following evil demagogue promises fantasy giveaways got masters legislative affairs worked healthcare policy space vote someone believes single payer get disagree call biden supporters brainwashed neoliberal foot soldiers milton friedman cannot underestimate importance defeating conservatives congress white house work hard whoever nominee constant insulting support sanders idiots bring together frequent subs maybe becoming toxic

promises fantasy giveaways in case sanders arguably true best scenario senate seats flipped barely get majority already committed ending fillibuster joe manchin voting so really promising something can't deliver bash left wing party act like multipayer universal healthcare works well germany easy build rather scrap everything start scratch thing anyone want exact version wants people die without policies moderates incremental change that fundamental disagreement pretend share bad faith bashing nothing fundamentally use context quote rant warren actually biden talking increased taxes wealthy effect lifestyle mean ill disagreements obviously talk given politics political spaces find unbearable come back primaries wins matter anyway intraparty fights 
lets give man made tonight possible rep jim clyburn everyone 
betcha aoc bernie types gonna start crying primary clyburn lmao 
jim quoting alexis de tocqueville awesome 
congressman jim clyburn endorsement south carolina primary effects throughout southern states yet come 
did see attempt primary pelosi ish percent vote he'll go general but got lmao 
pete dropped got mollywhopped south carolina up point hurting party crowing resources media attention delegates 
bernie would swept st folks dropping fact 
maybe maybe regardless year old mayor belong race first place thing may earlier never got 
idk man he going end primary one three people win state literally odds think joe would faster dropped ago look beto kamala booker dropping settle biden joes big last night came moderates consolidating 
van jones don't know how joe biden sucks grows your movement 
what learned unity antidote complaint politics 
when van jones astute enough point trash political strategy know must really bad seriously though always going come bernie campaign irresponsibly fanning flames division turn ugly they problem damaging likely nominee they're pushing narrative joe dementia just real gross stuff 
can't wait racial attacks van certain campaign 
it's like bernie read lord flies said yes he really needs hire pete give plan revolution 
maybe find cspan material thatll change things why ofcourse election isnt relevant leftist losing conservative incumbent states would never happen it almost years ago 
it's shame bernie's last run remembered petty attacks feed trump's populist carnival bullshit 
the depress turnout people might vote joe no one want win way 
van this moment trump became president jones said shit 
toxic sanders supporters preparing big ol nothing burger 
genuine question exactly joe's record segregation comments strom thurmond i'm split biden sanders i've obviously seen sander's side argument 
and yet biden supporters arent exactly trying win november every time check threads see voters ready unity name calling were going get crushed whether vote 
when van jones astute enough point trash political strategy know must really bad obvious i've never managed bernie supporter tell candidate better whether hillary warren joe fallback chosen they arguments favor even bernie's vote pay student debt sketchy speculation tax pass his answer he'll revolution can't show primary there just bunch people angry internet 
going turn campaign really ugly maybe they're likely next week lol 
they problem damaging likely nominee now sound familiar 
you know doctors legitimately worried biden right think trump wont maybe stiffen spine bit 
i'd also point moderate dems saying bernie wants venezuela type state dont see calling bullshit exactly shut 
that's whole point primary air things general you think trump going play kid gloves and course bernie running biden i'm sorry candidates campaign message better trump congratulations joined ranks sane politician 
oh must missed new talking point it seems walter mondale actually moderate time 
think better historical example mcgovern's grassroots progressive campaign republican incumbent crashed burned one biggest landslides history 
mean campaign another democrat first sucks hurts politicians feelings wait joe gets trump nothing insults biden 
stay sanders ancient history like segregation bothers my pragmatic politicians whats necessary get good possible joe's made mistakes done things pure never accomplished anything even mitch mcconnell brought people mlk protest 
says dude going campaign's sub telling they're losers 
asked bernie supporter know personally tell feel confident beat trump general election her answer essentially boiled movement 
'revolution' stayed home embarrassing why do think bernie best candidate good question one really thought hear like lot preferred prefer things private businesses goal making money involved health insurance roads another public schools government run military however believe way forward fixing aca would absolutely support thats happens want fight idea bernie's plan better step right direction also flawed joe beat disaster chief hope happily vote november wins primary 
i've bernie supporter tell burn test joe biden's insurance plan lol so toxic 
you right track named couple reasons vote bernie here https www politico com election candidates views issues bernie sanders hope helps 
yeah hope repeat primary goes way convention being unable pivot general pretty late hurt hillary bernie realize attacks joe going straight republican playbook prefer stuck message wait see voters want 
that lot words say malarkey dude 
that's pretty interesting practical idealistic actually true biden enforced segregation praised thurmond think people permanently tied past redeem especially since black voted en masse would like get complete story thanks 
yeah never get answer campaign specifically others movement joe getting near decent dude looking pump brakes trump things track moving forward quick pace add pete amy beto coalition aspiring leaders really makes decency upon rotr conduct rolled fold think bernie saying isnt guy personality cult 
just saying movement denote size 
bernie's truly his version kick millions insurance andrew yang's much better similar germany's joe biden yang wants tackle root cause healthcare cost also like pro nuclear bernie anti science comes energy france atm understand modern technology whereas takes talking points concerning automation loss jobs country wind solar power account sources there plant shut vermont caused fracking rely coal make why still advocating something work i've idea he prideful afraid admit wrong when asked lost due brushed saying in end voting person best policy disagree raising military budget 
know chance swaying opinion like mental exercise anyway medicare might save us money some studies say others eventual bump taxes would extreme what mean we idea whether it not never pay penny healthcare you single payer plans active countries canada taiwan north korea other different versions universal australia similar joe plan government option everyone insured thus another method increasing medical costs come centers pass cost people unable health insurance need everyone consolidates options wipes sector economy established cheaper they solutions issue frankly work get behind helping student loan debt think eliminated completely biden makes payback loans reasonable making community college free that measure benefit country graduates in held bachelor degrees number went looking ages so abolishing help helpful possibly but support not necessarily statistically average american degree even poorer areas problem comes public schools generally low income also performing high dropout rates graduation lower bound students most kids back system stopping short ready institution prepared failed community generally first step complete ged making gives ability test higher education see something want build skills lacking many to add credits part transferable take non major classes ge stuff four year two years taking someone figure experience lot saves two worth talk specifics forgiveness glad solid much climate change bernie calls elimination nuclear power once time research yet believe order go clean energy going the inequality gap affects voters rather vague types assume referring wealth supports taxing rich fact near costly tax fund although unlikely he likely raise well speaks concerns older especially black deal spoken lgbtq discussed received young willing bet issues based platform as point hypocrites yes complaints bros hypocrite pointing for cathartic seeing things hate opinions getting shouted nice one dislikes attacks senses defending radical refuge attracted actual working class more members voted try make sweeping generalizations broad diverse voting base proved care differ 
the reason support idea effect people currently employed health care industry i've also seen mom sign medicare nightmare and like employer plan want keep bernie's speculation tax untested modern financial sector reckless way pay student debt you dont working class probably got give fuck others thanks proving point if mine type i'd republican edit reply comments sending private message cry horrible person shitty life gets quick block 
actually want aca expanded public option never pass speculation tax either he's nothing empty promises my point saying though one tried pull bernie's group exclusive we need inclusive candidate welcomes everyone 
bernie says winning changing party ok true but going negative change thats value price 
how biden enforce segregation the timeline add unless confused 
well bernie issues if agree list vote someone agrees worried whether seems welcoming concerned views represented go watch videos robert reich clinton labor secretary think he great job explaining talks much series called common good the way make sure everyone basics food shelter education healthcare etc people start hoarding billions resources 
right held hostage keep losing republicans changing sufficiently 
do think pointing joe's views votes different negative seen stuff bernie camp yet links 
think arguments i've seen stance busing well eulogy thurmond segregationist 
bernie people dominate internet if seen biden voted war warmonger civil regime change senile misstated stuff used wrong names interviews absentmindedness normal must read anything 
for busing many people bused opposed simply hours children would commuting week important tool fight racial inequality also logistical challenge legally difficult implement 
ah okay pragmatic issues busing what thurmond though 
in politics make nice people disagree get things done know sound right time actually work 
gotta say foreigner interested american politics really enjoyed exchange 
originally pete supporter just voted joe california let's thing 
me so proud party coming together we're pete joe voters th congressional district

wow randomized names ballots similar https imgur com rrgafyt jpg only difference joe sestak top bernie sanders dead last belongs 
it's nice vote options least minimal descriptions in nc formal names info spotty reception center took go list hindsight prepared crap ton 
cool post amy first choice waited 'til south carolina voted joe yesterday colorado 
should voted rocky guy got best name ever seen lmao 
know overpost if kamala endorsed joe super tuesday california would fared better 
fellow californian supporter unsure long time would back harris dropped biden convinced he's man bring party together defeat trump fittingly know came radio driving home lucy sky diamonds let's go diamond joe 
why people dropped still ballot know already printed pete amy booker 
just aside darrell issa back is expected pick seat 
yup lakeside there many people voting polling place wonder early voted like then lakside heavily republican territory maybe republicans turning or could showed slow moment ha 
me orange county love early voting

he leading polls last time checked voted campa najjar dem hoping makes run november polling showing second behind issa race really nasty carl demaio closest republican rival 
nice leaderboard repliesnice nice's lerobinbot porousasshole backpackwayne am bot reply ignore and will stop replying to your comments 
mean illegal everywhere when allowed see markings official ballots let's say vindictive controlling parents bosses ask kid's workers voted right punish 
hope joe nominee i'm sure i'll volunteering much decided mainly need break next weeks either canvassing texting pete every day last month full time job so taking decompress get rested november 
ah ok not sure worked 
sanders lead democrats campaign treats like enemy 
nobody surprised even tried unite democrats one 
sanders protest candidate entire life its thing knows that running candidacy party trying run bernie essentially democrats republicans time isnt going work also much larger contingent democrat supporters past years mood completely reject made far clinton obama no one wants throw away dude offering free everything 
what hear read you can't love country hate half people let's better use motivate us protect one another 
the party sucks should lead it 
and followers expect convert anyone chastise belittle cheat competition videos berners telling iowans nh canvassing phone banking yang dropped vote bernie instead leading present day no way voting nice guy heart right direction zero bipartisan support policies busy fighting protesting everyone heck barely get dems ideas 
it also pointed every state voted far bernie underperformed numbers generally lot he tied nevada 
sanders really chance come front runner nv form coalition majority his stunning blowout strong performance among latino communities showed serious candidate he could reached point former candidates like booker beto well running warren amy try consolidate promises platform change cabinet positions get onboard instead said screw need busy taking victory laps attacking establishment well yesterday result folly remember everyone build bridges bern 
the minute bernie front runner everyone like yeah nah wait actually demographics electorates got chance fucking vote 
entire campaign shit i'm fucking here vibe actually fuck berniebros shit's messed everyone's waking msm 
all exactly on point you attack establishment running leader the if board policy enemy stance bernie worrying especially ballot dems no every candidate share view support treat down matters sanders supporters ignore fact progressive agenda good nothing democratic house senate 
people keep forgetting democrat he joined party run independent 
this great article governing working people 
whether like hill's rising know probably excellent postmortum super tuesday so primary issue given race racial justice post hear bring lot but really good the commenter noted ethnic minorities south democratic establishment protection they've republican hegemony racism exists everywhere visceral feel places hopelessness decades oppression people persist saying bringing establishment well think helping along 
it's stunning many democrats objectively see sanders independent runs dem suits needs then bashes democratic establishment party entire campaign he takes advantage dnc lambasting demolishing how could one possibly transparently democrat name only 
bernie needs watch survivor mr rodgers 
this plus many fervent supports' identities similar trump's supporters rooted outraged outsiders it's either bernie's way election power primed rise tea party faux grassroots movement backed incentive push deregulation agenda used bullying tactics force alignment ultra right wing one think work dem moderates older voters biden called pollyannaish talking days congress regularly worked across aisle tired divisiveness continual outrage older remember the super tue results reinforced 
half he hates republicans lol 
the problem democrats like democratic party shits take personally for trump different republicans felt disconnected disaster gwb able tap latent nativism feelings white insecurity their diverse therefore easy capture segments expense outgroups 
buttigieg supporter donated bernie early campaign bombarded texts every day donate okay fine then iowa started getting painting pete bad light talking hands billionares blocked numbers believe painted another candidate genuinely wants help country vision the world isnt black white right everything else wrong severely turned if get nomination vote nothing 
what yimby goat i'm curious 
guess shows disliked hillary many democrats probably republicans voted sanders protest it makes sad 
he joined socialism communism extremes left calls democratic socialist wanted slip if becomes cool drop part heart beat never fails say kind words evil communist regimes telling like take america 
yimby yes backyard goat greatest time 
trump says lot kind words likes putin kim jong un erdogan etc 
you see get mad turns straight purple lol 
thanks it seems bernie stans forgot vote for weeks i've seeing annoying north korean level propaganda are gonna stop ps i'm american 
know true also strategic level try get wants countries they got nukes pointed us want mouthing either bernie supported likes power still talking wonders communist regimes that would difference but decent arguing point excuse regardless 
that's good health blood pressure roof 
were around they're getting started 
certainly excusing bernie friend enemy simple real word often sadly defined want 
no joined reddit dec back trump bad bernie christ reincarnate i'm assuming posts upvotes actual votes cast 
bernie losing primary hillary almost bad joe she majority pledged delegates outright however stayed race far longer beat clinton could focusing general election this sadly modus operandi 
in call unity ocasio cortez says she'll back biden if he's democratic nominee 
aoc come ideologue much less seems coming early cool thing she also calls democrat fights believes said public option would huge win bernie settle single payer already compromise 
yes want left completely cold her endorsement bernie warren going haunt rest career 
it pretty important remember despite divisive bernie rhetoric plenty democrats favor social programs also believe strongly party unity progress progress the notion nothing incredibly immature contributed greatly mess trump 
aoc wants get reelected i've noticed vocal bernie 
she's much politically astute bernie 
feel like needs reaffirm democrat tbh this squad attacking party unhealthy us when write platform fucking work together get done what need bullshit complaint politics stopping progress dividing issues that hope nominate joe whole big tent gets room writes walk commit 
appreciate taking position i'm going pretend like squad minus ayanna pressley incredibly divisive harmful democratic party their rhetoric past year half perpetuated lot vitriol coming bernie bros 
she got cancelled probably lol 
mean that's nice sort bare minimum sitting democratic congresswoman back nominee general election 
good biden first choice obviously bad guy candidate this like bloomberg coming buying nomination we know fair square wish things turned differently definitely live president 
calls unity like exactly party needs applauded the big tent covers everyone 
now sanders drops race tells biden ball court voters go vote conscious would amazing end whole episode 
i'll support biden he's democratic nominee without hesitation i'm literally member socialists america all ask respect call us bernie bros try take parts sanders' platform making college tuition free cheap moment remake america's healthcare system please use half supporters want medicare form believe exit polls joe decent guy he's even close think good intentions person if give seat table easier accept we're part cult rather sincerely agree sanders issues we've scolded conduct behavior there's validity lecturing return favor i've said seriously treat 
all seeing reality situation fearing political viability 
looks like fear primary real 
immediately feel bad inevitable labeling sell secret establishment 
like aoc care endorses pretty neat 
she might survive election season branded traitor 
like rest squad she trying primary democrats coming short it's fights dems repubs i'm sick hope loses seat omar 
think aoc also still really young could easily see turning someone pragmatic like warren sanders she's obviously extremely talented politician bright future 
really like way burns republicans wish she'd grow democrats enemy phase recognize legislation always needs pass support moderate members need get moderates would replaced moved farther left we going progressive purity tests we'll fewer office lot including joe manchin help murkowski something in short term could play valuable role preventing bernie busters and might bit epiphany sees vile sexist treatment that's coming loses endorses biden 
single payer already compromise if bernie wtf ideal plan shudder think abomination 
if look aoc compared omar even close much brighter definitely long future politics yes subscribes purity tests morals yes tends parade others part least tolerable 
believe make room folks like alexandria democratic party lose country in opinion talented hard working politician democrats embrace whether agree specifics progressive plans we need everyone get beat trump fix messes 
think likely mainstream continue firebranding politics team sport folks 
she make amazing president one day future 
she made lot rookie mistakes since took office but 
honestly hope joe jumps opportunity either champion one bills help build progressive's run seat opposing another dem 
my respect meter dropped aoc day like sigh 
as far tell talk still waiting actually something constructive besides blasting twitter miss old guard 
what caused trump decades neoliberal globalisation democrats becoming touch cultural elitists 
she literally msnbc praising campaign yesterday saying sander said they backing whoever nominee 
as nancy pelosi said want something get votes it's resistant things people fighting knows pass house senate 
so smart sounds like good person side 
yeah end day despite lot heat moderates days think aoc overall positive presence public servant genuinely trying help people bernie platform immediately accomplish goals effective political spotlight long term progress good movements society 
i'm fine every sanders supporter know real life would even voted bloomberg general we what's stake this could last fair ish election country 
the bros real thing outside corners internet vast majority bernie supporters agree 
the words say warren dropped really improved opinion no sandbagging ill trying push one way she gave liz praise deserves she's starting become member squad i've got respect 
certainly hope calling biden republican deeply offensive tainted opinion considerably see potential point certain surrogates clearly influenced culture sanders campaign 
she's obviously extremely talented politician i'm fan what's evidence her primary accomplishment thus far winning low turnout dem district most endorsements failures 
speaking senators louisiana lost really great senator mary landrieu she conservative democrat meant brought tons money state voted obamacare seat act that's reality american government you can't get radical left bills though system need understand political put career line bill progressives want throw away they think something even leftist congress obama stretched democratic literally far could go 
like aoc overall though issues things deserves credit focusing primary efforts blue districts swing absolutely moderate older dems deep need replaced people hold values line hue district 
his ideal version probably uk's nhs government run hospitals government financing single payer system one keeps private compromise 
love diverse ideas party people push colleagues call record sand challenge incumbents it functional healthy operate leaving room debate discussion disagreement working toward goal aoc joe manchin feel free fight believe and given time let compelling case win where critical bernie democrat goes past policy feeding conspiracy theory narrative everyone corrupt bought sold corporatists 
not run employers endorse populists strong female candidates 
maybe stop acting like rep years take step back learn she's equivalent fresh college grads come workplace experience try completely change something understanding so annoying 
our boy joe made amazing choices especially early career let's give slack build bridge like 
yes know care lgbt black immigrant issues call identity politics like lot working class white people 
caused trump fact republican primaries winner take proportional votes like dems we'd president rubio cruz right 
she one better people bernie movement 
know tyranny vocal minority people wreck everything 
she also tweet basically told people online bullying exact words obviously something inclusive plus like make effort get warren's voters respect warren think consider ayanna part squad anymore especially broke others several votes backed aoc ones bright future imo 
doesn't squad include ayanna pressley she originally warren supporter heard much since 
to able garner sort following coincidence unseating incumbent 
absolutely moderate older dems deep blue districts need replaced people hold values line hue district agreed generally want country move left policy pragmatic way actually delivers maintains progress 
yes think party diversity tolerance tolerate differences opinions well although would personally love enact policies progressive dutch lack various solutions problems victim complex two things turned senator sanders years ago 
she came thinking going part wave would push party farther left miscalculated 
she's getting like policies see visible difference attitude towards moderate dems real work vs first started talented politician keep seat bet she'll end better ally long run progressive may actually able things should endorsed warren though what fuck thinking go bernie 
as woman know tough likeable also succeed country think probably even harder female politicians in defense would seat sat back waited turn her heart right place she works hard respect person young believed could change world years decades asset democrats learn get better experience 
making huge strides eliminating world poverty bad 
exactly we need steady push left allows dems win elections satisfied status quo 
close thought leader wave progressives flipped zero purple districts justice democrats seats recent elections runoffs they're middling kicking seasoned incumbents blue areas they compromise get even close goals in contrast mainstream biden especially fighting mfawwi aca it lieberman held stuck knife it's miscalculation simply dsa types america wants look hood past marketing 
she could done warren plans track record courted true champion aoc claimed believe instead went misogyny populism achieved revolution guy named post office in weeks bernie race party still senator ma likely powerful cabinet member let's see goes 
when literally one endorsed seat midterms maybe self reflected bit 
she acts like super star brand new congress represents one tiny district huge deal 
what fuck thinking go bernie popular wants 
i'm woman management field often person color room so know first hand kind sexism that's hidden behind label likeable aoc election year voter turn low district drumming support amongst wealthy young professionals recently moved area drummed long term residents she also win spreading lies joe crowley who way extremely effective legislator fighting people time accomplished nothing since getting congress zero qualifications internship volunteering put community organization influencing policy grassroots level many freshman elected officials done sorry share view think little offer outside populist divisive rhetoric 
think backed different people still support ayanna little older old practical governing style really like 
excuse believe renamed two post offices 
guess still understand think do changed stances should endorse people some endorsed pete amy warren none nomination everyone also self reflect bit 
guess understand would would like stop talking media to expressing opinion 
sounds right thanks sharing thoughts that kind impression got reading kinds things says 
bashing aoc good look let focus positive trying unite she represents constituents whatever think got hustled bartender anywhere nyc one quickest wittiest people workforce fan style questioning house razor sharp way getting core issue absolutely asset us 
thanks sharing details all may true outworked joe crowley she wore holes pair shoes earned seat also happen think bartender years entails qualifies person fine politics unqualified sure could better plenty people we see career goes 
think depends look imo joe crowley gotten lot progressive legislation congress years like sitting butt twiddling thumbs aoc campaigning it different kind work total zero bills passed since taking office past four bartender qualifies there's anything shameful indicates qualified congress person most people politics serve local grassroots efforts give knowledge need make connections get write policy you official paid capacity volunteer organizations or city district government positions state first hope take wrong way would say what yoh believe congress's it's twitter building coalitions writing getting negotiating support etc why assume better job experience 
unqualified sure could better plenty people slightly qualifications aoc fully convinced know nearly enough nuts bolts politics get anything accomplished there's reason usual route local state federal it's like apprenticeship 
that's great explanation guess said better republican congress people it's hard get politics rich work multiple jobs know found something democrats seem lacking trump proved qualifications matter american my experience campaigns days door knocking things voter registration turnout but back day youth thought going save world politician well lucky enough win school thing send one person per district capital behind curtain trip member we saw lot got meet learned really working young year old interns they writing bills and elected give two shits except getting real turned so i'm qualified smart could damn sure post offices open man almost presidency 
think maybe underestimating pete's qualifications to mind exceptional education plus service army officer mayor fairly large city make good candidate if get vp really hope he'll consider taking one indiana's republican senators 
meant disrespect small town mayors usually make presidential races saying pete waited supposed run put dues poster suggesting would mayor small lost last state wide race points came rd dnc chair he office proven could bring votes elected obama criticized inexperienced years senate local experience beto term congressman got republicans saw earn million called 
whenever see politics post bernie surging polls 
bernie goes point biden still points ahead politics post dems say bernie has best chance to win nomination and general media ignores surge in polls 
i'm pretty sure commondreams site writes headlines specifically politics clickbait lol 
biden devotes entire prolific career promoting unions improving working class quality life sanders supporters omfg he ate dinner with millionaire he's literally just as bad trump we're winning tho because the polls are discriminating against people who attend furry conventions

dave wasserman calls washington state primary joe biden 
sanders wa caucus https en wikipedia org wiki washington democratic caucuses people voted also state run primary dems ignored delegates hillary votes already today ballots left count likely lean heavily dem almost million 
https twitter com nate cohn status sanders gets better result spokane wins today's ballots compared split yesterday over biden new today counties initial county 
we can't stop getting higher and 
how peculiar earlier twitter saw people saying wa taking long counted bernie dnc delays results wins minimize momentum impact 
think best primary site would one showed state delegate spread that's really matters north dakota sanders washington california mississippi biden etc 
joe lot votes those things supposed matter it mattered last week people wanted warren drop 
sanders admitted press conference today it bad night last really liked sander's recognizes end near campaign and wants take opportunity sunday's debate address joe planning heal party it's divided right people age voted there's enough voting edit voter suppression obviously factor general still holds true young show the overwhelmingly biden there fine middle ground risk losing election alienate popular policies found exit polls going get nomination can't leave behind 
no one else state yet 
so guy who's supposed responsible energizing voters win low turnout caucuses lol 
now needed time rig votes favor biden 
this pretty good state summary like https www realclearpolitics com epolls president democratic delegate count html 
going back even nevada democratic electorate yet vote too bad bernie leading votes delegates dnc must listen voters coronate now biden winning million apparently rigged these guys lost cause 
i'm confused bernie acknowledges path using debate sunday attempt get biden commit things progressive base wants however bernie's goal able drop saying agrees shit want endorsement can't really go hard make look awful endorses days later so super interesting see like added thought format answer questions voter submissions seems focus directly 
if sanders reach directly coordinate approach there's going back it good give cheat sheet what's come next step two campaigns coordinating tempo flow hit avoid this needs like late night talk show interview everything pre vetted debate time one side score points it's want stuff biden team plan get 
i'm hardcore bernie supporter think rational people see writing wall also blue matter train really biden needs address popular policies sanders medicare abolishment student debt the party torn right moderates progressives definitely winning still large amount need addressed shown we're abandoning ideals way win election comes together looking forward sunday give concessions hopefully bring 
sshhhh can't say reddit but yes lower turnout better bernie higher worse he's supposed beat trump reasons 
wouldn't biden risk alienating moderate voters got point adopts progressive agenda though that's big chunk electorate well see flexible certain issues willing compromise completely abandoning middle ground there plenty areas agreement minimum wage tackling climate change universal health care the way achieve goals differs however like said repeatedly take away private insurance will back i'm curious find 
his debate either either sanders absolutely destroy biden way one could ever come back would dementia bullshit slightly true he'll public platform tell supporters vote giving even support 
bernie can't really go hard debate the summary campaign enough biden ultimately lead failure suspect either what got speech today essentially admitting defeat every single exit poll showed support sanders policies people wanted electable candidate he wants address joe plans voters' policy stances alienate risk losing general election 
i'm reminded yang's early interviews fox business best interviewers gave questions folks home would thinking it chance directly address concerns holding hope sanders could play role basically youth vote clearly favors platform going need win november joe make pitch 
what annoys experts winning elections never wrong talk trump liberal candidate who'll appoint better judges bench also saying foreign policy instincts aoc wins primary deep blue district everyone like the progressive tide taking rip moderate dems justice go including squad flip red seats jeremy corbyn backs see lose embarrassing fashion hyping years bernie going win white working class black voters increasing voter turnout conspiracies i'm done fuckers maybe admitted sometimes i'd okay that's grift ends gotta keep doubling passing buck 
i'm saying biden make any concessions bernie trying save face

face obama says award highest honor realizes fuck he's talking tho 
like joe's replies congradulate venerate barack obama instead joe handed one greatest honor american citizen proceeds tell everyone room great guy love honesty stumbles lot speaks genuineness 
one time favorite moments joe idea coming understood honor 
this campaign ad his reaction genuine it's moving he loves country best intentions 
trump tarnished everything interesting see rebound 
trump tossing things like paper towel hurricane disaster site fluff ego 
rules road no matter much may dislike 
nate silver retiring primary forecast model diamond joe robinette biden jr essentially presumptive democratic nominee president united states 
the model is now obsolete

let snarky sanders biden want things different ways really hope make supporters feel welcome possible 
surprised bernies message support biden gets nom debate but jeez supporters seem page reddit remotely indication really curious pan 
lol sanders one sabotaged hillary staying months became presumptive nominee this guy large part reason hillary lost trump zero respect online supporters the irl ones fine though

as warren supporter someone rally la days ago saddened campaign end pragmatic progressive obama first president privilege campaigning happy say giving time money support biden 
former warren buttigieg supporter remember obama biden embraced consumer financial protection bureau liz championed 
welcome i'm still trying process pete dropping 
warren right progessive candidate bernie but joe get ideas values life welcome aboard 
i'm going miss warren glad ran to paraphrase yang couple days ago elizabeth deserved much got primary 
as former beto supporter welcome the thing like joe wants keep loving liz you're right place 
honestly see half warren's support going bernie makes wash benefit biden what sense supporter 
as someone who's warren fan since senate race back support hot second would happily campaigned supproted done better and fellow pragmatic progressive wanna welcome board biden bus 
welcome warren high list if flip senate top majority leader her able tell mcconnell shut would delicious 
started warren year ago she best plan heard candidate address housing joe foreign policy right gonna get country back track would make hell vp otherwise stay senate maintain majorities 
voting joe biden senate also 
pete number two biden close third her work bureau made want run president she puts ideas action unlike certain cranky old yeller stubborn end campaign unify party would drastically improve chances beating trump showing unified front 
me just joined sub today progress right haha 
pete great pragmatic progressive well hope becomes vp 
call obama democrat but think that's 
actually think warren end campaign going net benefit biden from people met person volunteer work online via secret facebook groups higher educated base bernie most know support pragmatic progressives hated give progressive agenda bad reputation negativity lack unifying message detailed plans abrasive attitude towards questioning bashing legitimate news reporting cult personality continually encouraged there lot hillary supporters became if look statistics supporting completely different demographic much aligned even endorses go us saw ability lead staff let alone 
i'm former warren supporter think people would gone bernie already left last fall started slipping polls honest multi step roll magically bypass congress get done day one remain pragmatic ones like op largely go biden 
not op another warren supporter switched bernie days thought logical nd choice didnt feel what liked aside bold progressive fierce fighter working class less fortunate pragmatism she fights smart fight builds alliances coalitions clout someone respectable gets shit done bernies heart always right place senate record lacking he gives good speeches makes protest votes certainly debate dont see unilaterally push massive expensive radical agenda congress many republicans moderates joe i'd like bad picked wrong side hes still progress reverse trump cement obama's legacy decade believe rally progressives maybe moderate republicans 
voted warren tuesday big time pete supporter large number friends irl my sense lot necessarily excited joe dislike bernie strong agree generally educated policy wonk loving demographic bernie's lol describes i'm starting get 
liz fantastic she experienced hate coming bernie camp disgusting towards pete and sad supporters treated respect for even absolutely agreed every way still want country continue angry hateful path time heal 
for sure one thing like biden ogs adopting subs culture rotr adopted and warn certain supporters really test discipline aspect 
another warren biden think right lot us 
yeah think speaks well uncle joe's leadership supporters candidates welcomed votes volunteer work also ideas he's sharing credit real team mentality required candidate age 
yes you get focused process enunciation rather content 
also distinct advantage creating paraphernalia allows us continue originally supported the amount pete joe stuff seen amazing there's amy beto its reassuring it motivates help uncle ways 
joe biden twitter my running mate woman 
senator tammy duckworth would great choice 
hmm wonder klobuchar kamala warren someone completely left field 
lie wanted pete but feel like he's assured important cabinet position anyway big step mayor south bend put good trajectory 
great move not many things get coverage coronavirus happening 
someone already know like harris or someone left field tammy duckworth 
if chooses klob please someone tell stop fucking hair joke says constantly https www youtube com watch cejgbrbufha 
love andrew yang's tweet heard didnt say conversations obviously joke yang funny 
well go high hopes maybe we'll get secstate pete 
great news abrams harris vp would like see ag to look trump barr face announces investigations administration gold 
my bet klobuchar super productive senator lot experience appeal rust belt central campaign actually thought likely vp pick made announcement if next probably harris 
the ideal vp moment would latina early 's western state years political office congress like sotomayor younger governor dont think person applaud announcement pick woman there many make great potus 
fine klobuchar harris think warren either stay senate put cabinet 
love kamala harris also mentioned would putting african american woman supreme court my best guess klobuchar ticket court nominee 
how tweet middle debate mean know actually write send tweets attributed account least like pretend this really ruins suspension disbelief i'm looking live camera joe biden posting twitter 
hey joe vote solid adopt medicare for all 
everyone keeps saying harris abrams elect vp help flip swing states feel like one important considerations know representative california georgia midwest 
he chooses aoc he's done that said think gonna kamala harris 
agree hopefully joe choses people might think still green great women veterans immigrants 
as someone lives two blocks outside former district unfortunately rep far milquetoast represented senate completely agree total class great experience 
dont go threatening good time 
the names frequently mentioned addition tammy duckworth stacey abrams baldwin gretchen whitmer there really lot great options 
hopefully someone field lot political experience 
please tammy please edit duckworth 
warren vp needs relatively young there's year difference predict left field though worry might harris demographic political expediency reasons my main reason thinking think would poor decision biden make many decisions consider 
the betting markets pretty evenly split kamala klobuchar like chance everyone else less likely 
janet napolitano former az governor also val demmings fla congresswoman 
the dream ticket would biden clinton that's probably going happen mind chose either warren kamala vp 
imo klobuchar vp well loved mid west slam dunk election kamala harris attorney general warren stays congress 
as gay countless bachelorette parties never single bachelor party think still count female people lol kidding wanna keep dream alive 
we lucky tammy duckworth ticket 
pete place cabinet buden wants truly representative us need lgbtq higher ups white house if anything happened biden general covid imagine would short list people like take top ticket 
yeah feel it pretty much crushed care politics 
it's like there's shortage qualified women choose what skills abilities think sacrificed decision 
oh god watch entire video 
he talked lot un ambassador that would seem like great starting point high profile secretary state requires someone way experience foreign affairs pete think long promising career politics ahead 
sally yates ag and next involved investigation trump done special counsel independent 
amy great choice paper she minnesota purple state could swing trump upcoming election this help biden's chances keeping also popular industrial mid west must win states like michigan wisconsin appeal folks suburbs primary campaign target her downfall lack favorabikity for whatever reason research shows people much issue least little https www realclearpolitics com epolls amy klobuchar favorableunfavorable html 
catherine cortez masto nevada https en wikipedia org wiki meets lot suggestions eight years attorney general three senator 
her record ag turned controversial ended much weaker candidate debates people expecting she's also california swing state means biden already great black outreach without think pretty weak choice overall 
after called racist no thanks 
that weird hell ticket think gonna obama former ag 
he may occasionally write tweets though context scrolling twitter spontaneously deciding tweet hillary used sign team 
guessing got social media team this president tweets morning pish golden toilet 
to fair abrams lost gubernatorial run couple thousand votes clinton list state might bring georgia play 
if increase turnout ga though puts senate seats potentially play especially jungle primary one bet it'd help states like nc that's important 
aoc young she eligible another years 
she senator long obama elected and house years if keep letting baby boomers say gen millennials green never pass torch us 
with birth thailand duckworth able become president sure stacey abrams gets joe she awesome might help dems work end voter suppression baldwin whitmer contenders 
someone younger would also smart move we need start getting spotlight rising stars party future election cycles 
biden pelosi what could possibly go wrong 
long someone quits politics can't handle ever 
shouldn't someone little experience to cultivate younger generation 
either tammy would great honestly 
massachusetts holds special elections warren's replacement would likelihood another dem 
each brings something different table kamala would history making first female vp poc ca really help terms electoral advantage ever play problems way bigger running mate status change klobuchar midwest much ease bernie supporters ticket 
klobuchar dull uninspiring though proved good campaigning childish meltdown previous debate sign joe repeat hillary's tim kaine mistake abrams seems vastly better choice she inspiring 
it's movie casting fantasy football draft choose prominent celebs image cheerleading related reasons 
agree obviously biased towards amy though biden progressive think someone moderate might make democrats republicans comfortable like tammy duckworth kamala would kick ass ag 
no an ideologically split ticket bad idea especially president old biden who's unofficially floated serving one term progressives win election klob someone like best bet going voters gave house back democrats the crazy minority bernie bros might vote third party trump get way warren progressive but firebrand could scare away purple state independents created blue wave 
think would smart move she's woman mom vet military and immigrant family choice get sides vote 
not saying but also men qualified 
we agree disagree trump cronies held accountable unprecedented corruption administration 
she fantastic senator loved far got primaries but vanilla boring joe needs someone young exciting like obama needed bring calm experience maturity ticket 
most show tie many people like from understand biden similar favorability rating way less opinion 
maybe reputation mean staff while competent thing true that's someone potentially leading country 
never heard drilled bit think could perfect great resume harris killer ag warren klobuchar replacing moscow mitch cabinet impressive hell 
perdue gonna tough unseat loeffler whoever wins primary one could picked 
gen mattis required years service congress changed law let anyways that's works top 
agreed they said kennedy obama green think she'd ideal ppl sayin it'll harris 
with birth thailand duckworth able become president yes tammy https en wikipedia org wiki early life education natural born citizen despite father citizen 
think one duckworth's parents dad believe american citizen would qualify able run president way it's deal ted cruz his mom born us even though cuban could canada 
haven heard popular mi smart move help numbers state 
ohh hell they come pelosi harder came hrc we need house anyway 
joe needs someone who'd able job president right day he's old would oldest president ever several years while seems great health think experienced vp who's younger calm minds lots folks inclined vote scared inexperienced taking worst case 
for sure followed baldwin much duckworth everything i've seen far great 
you correct incorrectly assumed governor would appoint replacement interim office remain vacant special election edit actually first time the gov 
would love see harris tear pence shreds debate also joe nominee hope sense pick running mate helps unite party inspire voter turnout my ideal warren klobuchar dud 
one nice thing ca senate seat would safe 
joe biden has won texas 
hahahaha this amazing greatest chicken joint texas 
gonna eat whataurger tomorrow celebration 
this incredible can't believe pulled joe never polled high even peak for come back like far behind early vote damn people really hit polls yesterday 
how say layne's cane's exist 
truly beto table biden stood 
laughs honey butter chicken biscuit texan love whataburger triggered like motherfucker first saw tweet 
saw lol i'm hoping someone intentionally trolling us figure otherwise could dumb 
don forget honey bbq chicken strip sandwich 
they referring chicken joint went earlier day screwed showing pic whataburger 
florida alone effectively wipe bernie states 
the longer bernie stays supporters hatred biden fester greater chance trump gets elected imagine voting hate 
bernie needs drop tonight if media joe general public need give attention tulsi gabbard next nothing 
statements like need politics etc these types statements make realize come together 
is fl winner take state or really large 
see much hate biden weak attacks fall flat like he's smart wins debate 
lot people ignoring bernie point biden still win general without bernies supporters for example convince republican moderates vote 
this crazy happening biden happened hillary somewhat understood way media portrayed made seem shady untrustworthy better candidate much electable bernie people need start realizing possible he's losing even worse last time running 
imagine voting trump hate biden sounds stupid hillary clinton it's good thing one enough 
set delegate threshold needed next debate joe stage 
holy shit tulsaad garb ge still officially dropped yet 
thata'd make angrier look bernie's subreddit already response loss basically election process meddled taking well 
it's large biden got huge margin ap showing delegates bernie point there's still final counts total change slightly 
there winner take states democratic primary that's republican thing 
check bernie subreddits plenty hate biden along everyone supporter 
lol keep getting people twitter tell biden trump policy wise hope either trolls huge minority voters crazy 
sanders surrogates cannot effectively weaponize misogyny like 
he already converting republican moderates many said would consider voting biden never vote sanders 
that reason lost she campaign rust belt felt blue wall going hold matter 
are gonna anymore debates thought finished 
she's russia's pockets hillary correctly called months ago 
it's also electoral college functions states maine nebraska 
i'm sure look hard enough find mean general think joe going likability problem hillary and let's honest likeability it misogyny sexism man shield 
say she made mistakes campaign strategy it make voting trump propaganda fueled hatred towards hillary tiny bit less dumb 
hindsight she never trailing poll wisconsin campaigned heavily pennsylvania 
watch minutes eating ice cream mirrored shades quarantine fun 
think mid march plan advance anymore decide race goes you see many presidential primaries go long 
no need look hard it frequent open agree joe lack likability problems 
you definitely misguided the reason hillary lost sexism weak campaign identity politics going first woman president taking competition seriously obama energy faith nation republicans strong candidate picked boring one 
oh sure anyone votes trump enemy country period 
wasn only sexism sexism played factor 
years attacked help lot dems vote thought evil told long biden problem pull republicans like trump would never hillary 
that correct however astonishing thing whereas traditional conservatives voted someone still strongly supporting agenda people proudly trump calling progressives something thats actually far dumber voting conservative want country believe favorite lost personally dislike got nomination would hillary theres way knowing despicable nonetheless 
disagree she unlikeable personality always behaved everyone inferior and like said lot people considered malicious whether misguided we'll probably never know however biden really problems pointed his umbrella policy going unite every anti trump voter republican democratic alike my concern sanders' supporters also support general election sanders inevitably loses primary this may sting bother vote 
what saying cutting nose spite face 
think proved bernie's movement big thought the ones choose vote biden probably make difference

realize till today much enjoy duo not think pete vp mainly would good pick woman running mate nice see comradere respect otherwise combative process 
let's civil towards sanders we need support supporters' win 
biden leads sanders ten points enthusiasm among supporters 
it's showing polls positive hard data take bank 
the reply even believe twitter thread imo absolutely correct truly know going debate tonight 
the crazy thing numbers match pretty closely march its almost debates early states noise 
you're gosh darn right i'm enthusiastic man who's gonna progressive american president ever 
no more malarkey will never tire of saying that you can tell am enthused by my use caps lock 
mean given recent weeks natural 
supporters leading candidate enthusiastic supporters runner colour surprised 
can get explanation metric used predictions 
race would absolutely never declared bernie kind lead biden 
that's happens people known decades 
it seems like electorate terrified take chance new face year two best known candidates ended final usually debates early states matter 
one analyst said easy win back voters supported first place so started supporting biden looked around moderate choices disappeared came home they always liked thought people meantime 
seems like bernie giving biden chance win wholehearted endorsement in obvious clinton superficial wants avoid supporters go rogue 
who also experience repair foreign policy handle national crisis like one we're currently going 
it declared poll enthusiasm insurmountable lead biden gotten sorry bud unless drops dead mathematical way bernie win 
https gyazo com ef fde bea bad cb cd db do think sanders biden swapped race would declared 
if polls rest states showed bernie winning yes it would biden stop whole tin foil hat conspiracies what understand make difference delegates needs win big least no show let alone large margin there multiple coming sanders might even pick single delegate florida kinds losses the true everything complete reverse 
unknowable delegates best metric they count convention sure measure way things going 
based polling biden dropped endorsed warren summer 
no based polling odds majority bernie ever went one less week he bit chance get chances winning 
dude polling months anyone votes literally meaningless bernie cannot make difference accept if feel right come back comment weeks see 
didnt say bernie would win said nonsensical claim debate based discrepancy polling actual votes why afraid anyway maybe support mush brain guy pete told cabinet position 
say debate and hilarious think biden got mush brain yet beat bernie guess even guy also support pete endorsed huge supporter woke fuck can stand 
say debate then reply thread disagreeing someone saying yet beat bernie being caught multiple lies winning universe biden good candidate huge supporter woke fuck clinton got tired defend obviously awful ideological reasons sound familiar

believe presumptuous tasteless sanders tweet definitely one reasons i'm new donor cause biden first hope fight end trumptocracy he's last here's strong showing tuesday cheers 
yeah i'm sure pete's supporters would join movement consisting base called rat among derogatory things 
read earlier thought what incredibly presumptuous lack tact 
i'm strong pete supporter however way bernie implicitly allowed supporters trash candidates joe he's best chance beat trump importantly he's actual decent human can't take ridiculous astroturfing buttigieg disingenuous trying feign outrage bernie's staff doxxing tonight it's gross anyway wish still ballot vote mailed week ago thanks nice welcome everyone this actually people 
voted pete early california wish could revote biden given recent turn events looked rules unfortunately can't wrong nevertheless supporting joe rest way remember interactions supporters pleasant respect despite differences opinion same said sanders want label people patterns appear going collegel nearly everyone voting one day club tabling asked after saying started questioning allegiance millennials would vote wall street millionaire they already facts that interaction left sour taste mouth as title says taught judge treat lowest highest 
sanders nerve asking pete supporters join this guy best delegitimize pete's win iowa stood silently went call rat used many homophobic slurs 
die hard pete person the contrast two tweets exactly subbed today rally around biden stop sanders trump sec defense absolutely live 
this insightful post the juxtaposition really speak volumes 
this tweet straw broke camel's back far supporting sanders 
god hate bernie sanders the man transparently self serving as movement viable option 
many bernie supporters idolize act like fools it really helped push away bern vote pete instead going support biden forward 
used maintain benefit doubt mindset bernie like disagree beliefs respect seems honest this election season far eroded faith person he's nothing egotistical jackass refuses compromise anyone continues run even though statistically speaking man age suffered heart attack real chance surviving first term anyone love would realize need bow support healthier progressive alternative warren but our lord and savior saint bernard i'll vote he's nominee i'm done trying sake diplomacy 
thank joe we pete fans appreciate let's win thing unity beats division kindess anger respect trying cannibalize votes hours dropped 
you expect praise pete bernie criticized heavily he's going pander pete's supporters giving empty flattery 
in fairness bernie may tweeted think meant harm but regardless team joe 
yeah using words us selfish prick move 
went sanders' twitter find tweet did delete 
you correct many us horrible taste mouth sanders supporters tacit tolerance behavior 
it's bit narcissistic bad trump mentality dim witted middle school bully 
the thing liberals seem dislike trump unkind 
this early vote unless late primary 
plus whole thing kept calling buttigieg billionaire puppet based total campaign funds sorry pete opportunity transferring senate money use several pacs run long mathematically eliminated get essentially nonstop except couple months general five years 
sanders literally running ads claiming he's first candidate ever win iowa nh nevada such bullshit pete ia multiple candidates including gore kerry three well 
his volunteers also sending texts saying iowa well nh nv like nah pete 
word completely agree although think pete bad vp choice sec def would fitting well 
wait also mod is somewhere 
hate people say care support people reddit oh big supporter this i'm longer get real dude sanders much next guy types comments idiotic nobody believes 
you're making decision hold powerful office world based tweet staffer wrote it's even offensive pretty typical presidential campaign welcome new support sanders either seems really silly 
there concrete proof and self serving pete path forward think would much rather biden win sanders 
it's fine bit thoughtless least strong hints narcissism 
it tweeted name matter actually people need stop excusing everything bad bernie saying say man much surrounds 
the staffer doxxed pete fired if anything comes sanders brush saying condone asshole published personal cell number remain campaign bernie cult continue use homophobic slurs rat emojis spam tweets rest career that people they evil 
colorado governor jared polis is 
https twitter com berniesanders status 
pete iowa it confirmed multiple times even larger margin previously thought and bernie simply disregarded behavior people taking ownership saying part movement 
ohh fuck dishonest little shit buttigieg declared victory iowa based internal numbers showing winning guess campaign because also showed and win it lot closer never less litterally every candidate race would done thing ones fucked democratic party denied incompetence say stood silent incredibly disingenuous he denounced anyone personal attacks calling bernie supporters interviews town halls big debates yeah made gestures then staff go continue encourage like let high level jill stein 
would love biden buttigieg ticket think way pick woman running mate 
bernie spoke press tweet posted literally said exact thing think alone determine ones support pretty tasteless line massive ego 
doubt staffers write tweets maybe edit official statements we need draft statement assuming outright fabrication highly cynical 
he still congratulate acknowledge pete iowa sanders sore loser 
even tweeted see anything egregious also look comment history know bernie apologist like stopping supporters level nitpick things big deal 
this kind shit toxic political discourse criticize individuals generalize every bernie supporter evil actions that's hateful 
the comments hilarious tons people pretending former pete supporters switching bernie yet tweet history calling buttigieg rat 
larger margin margin sde smaller and bernie popular vote initial realignment what's wrong saying say enough honestly idea even possibly could would interested hear however argument silent clearly on contrary strongly disavowed attack candidates he avoided questions one 
eh people always way sensitive reactionary things candidate want see lose really think worth even making thread 
my larger point really tweet worth offended regardless wrote 
all current former dnc candidates simply congratulated pete campaign managed accomplish only bernie makes 
calling spade all seen months bernie bros homophobia forget ever forgive 
the fact current governor shitposts reddit hilarious amazing 
they make less obvious least 
strongly disavowed attack candidates when he simply said part movement combines conversation russian pro trump trolls takes zero responsibility hate divisiveness spreading 
maybe isolation but absolutely shows trend narcissism smugness divisiveness campaign supporters justifiably infamous 
briahna joy gray makes hard scrutinize bernie's press releases 
are basing purely internet comment sections something it's absolutely ridiculous think bernie supporters anti gay even make sweeping generalizations people like guarantee small minority support 
i'm even colorado big polis fan 
guarantee small minority support high level bernie campaign staffer media surrogate doxxed today twitter published personal cellphone number they disconnect phone sheer amount death threats spam calls coming most evidence posted pro accounts that perpetuating act violence first openly gay presidential candidate and one apologized seriously look said come away completely disgusted appalled question humanity worth time 
if trump accomplices go ahead trying smear biden son bloomberg adviser tim brien says ready respond ads crime family 
love bloomberg attack dog much candidate 
my stance bloomberg drastically flipped less week what interesting time live 
god love coalition bloomberg ad team combined pete ground game amy legitimacy hopefully warren progressives it going strong democratic election obama building this little different works 
good ivanka others benefit position government 
trumps problem get free tv time like point rich guys want throw good money bad his funds dry bloomberg bury 
ads trump crime family but 
back trump gop heavy propaganda machine this year bloomberg's billions ads going get interesting general like bloomberg person i'm ok truce appreciate support beat 
just talk trump broke law investigating biden mcturtle covered 
bloomberg good example people complicated he's done shitty things he's funding gun control particular i'm grateful going pour billions flipping swing states attacking trump 
wait biden son vs trump kids 
hate candidate love side what's word 
plz bloomberg inappropriate walk around public like 
this news people trump supporters care 
still need clearly answer allegations tho go offensive clear name give great big shame smearing son key pete's defense https youtu tbcimclwrd 
respect mr bloomberg finally going long ago right so sloppy af grifters 
why reapond withnads trump crime family beforehand if know evil expose no 
is democracy live if one corrupt politician attacks another son billionaire air ads original 
the difference trump fans already know still vote democrats though might hesitate so play game think need something else 
love team each person nice little niche joe needs 
remember bill maher saying democrats win needed find steve bannon type maybe guy took nra backed democrats house races poured millions climate change 
does bloomberg's ex candidate status allow bypass laws would keep going support nominee 
i've always wanted dems billionaires backing thems rules want buying seats when change get kind money politics country better bloomberg necessary 
many issues bloomberg candidate president person political activist 
let make sure leave room bernie crowd bring progressive ideas well warren brings wonky difficult details plans passion ideological drive keep pushing society forward excited general 
same biden campaign volunteer called tonight invite event detroit that first time ever received call even though moved mi vote joe sc last week 
timing everything people tendency remember what's fresh especially there's much wade 
also say someone who's airways blanketed bloomberg ads good month super tuesday vote hired really ad team 
nope process arguments persuade people hunter never gotten job that's flirting voting blue want biden answer 
we get debate make undercard 
but may reaffirm people feeling defeated hunter ukraine ads unmotivated vote trump is fact much worse 
this news people really bad fox news demographic polticially apathetic american public 
allegations exactly this investigated death nothing illegal begin 
bloomberg throwing unprecedented sums vast fortune showing tv watching ignoramuses donald trump truly forget haters he's patriot 
this exactly you change system rules gives fucked we win given first go ahead enact campaign finance reform 
right we want billionares buying candidates seats 
same if wants pour money social causes good buying presidency fuck 
for sure want count bernie yet feel dissrespectful supporters that said biden pull primary hope jumps brings passion forefront while may cabinet position store might able put numerous young progressives leadership positions within administration really hoping passing touch thrusting new democrats giving experience need carry party forward in order happen though defiantly support 
same in super tuesday state saw shit ton ads also never skipped he'd money understand correctly watched his ad people top notch almost starting believe 
glad hear think going need help get 
joe biden nothing get son job he control adult children meanwhile trump's sit government offices taxpayer funded salaries cry nepotism 
ohhh trump troll larps progressive like called politics follows 
yes be weary anyone pretends made colossal screw ups professional personal lives bloomberg giving vast amounts wealth improve america best ways knows given decades life public service besides creating tonnes jobs 
real question what's best strategy citizens united thing mean obviously could say constitutional amendment know that's politically possible right something done congress upheld current court 
nearly annoyed running got competed first contests like everyone else strategy getting late spoiling moderate lane played game realized path delegates mattered really bothered mean super tuesday could easily netted bernie bloomberg slipping vote everywhere colorado we're lucky lot voters choose hold election day opposed early voting see south carolina went one 
the reality bernie biden win remaining delegates become nominee now upcoming states election pretty much favor except low delegate high probably break strongly one direction another math certainty give 
if joe nothing get job response talking trump congress across deflecting suggests lack answer merits 
what talking idea even care voted biden politics least month pro sanders sub absolutely detest man https imgur com rrrfpeo jpg as disturbing views np reddit democratsfordiversity comments fbrltj dfd discussion thread march fj hebj

anybody else the lines wrapping around building 
crowd know butti dropped rxn like 
we see biden says something nobody aware 
anyone know capacity venue organizers talked said rally raleigh yesterday 
that's nuts wish travelling work 
uh thanks attractive young woman blackz trump totally weird troll 
im trump supporter biden win 
another good reason vote joe 
most democrats vote joe many moderates like trump but biggest challenge would gathering enough grassroot level volunteers work for door knocking get eday believe hillary outnumbered comes knockers rally attendants grass root workers decide election 
come roberts stretch ultraconservative thomas maybe alito could called anything else 
what incentive progressives vote joe rather ultra conservative judges put trump simply biden 
very worried election process covid spreading everyone we'll move online everything ok um 
if think grassroots organizing door knocking key election make joe biden less electable candidate 
and know moscow mitch call democrats corrupt 
so ultraconservative rescued aca twice highest number unanimous opinions iirc rate higher rehnquist 
either way you get point if trump wins probably replace rbg sarah palin lol 
the virus pretty much ran course november 
right flatten curve practising social distancing joe biden bernie help situation holding rallies etc must drop promptly he win if midwest south vote droves these people came primaries general california washington state new york choice i've online voting ages like idea hundreds waiting lines november it's probably bit early make call i'm confident solid solution developed let alone it break tampered 
think getting votes key election joe electable 
not scaring living shit everyone thirty also key 
yes think grassroot organizing indeed joe's weakness his strength he's pulling lot moderate voters but better job inspiring youth we'll accept trump 
by appointing asserting senate refused comply constitutional duties it would likely gone scotus found non justiciable political question 
to fair rbg chance bowed obama years guess democrats assumed they'd win next election that bad call 
got folks camp think okay lie score cheap political points if wanted malarkey i'd go watch videos 
the ripple effects going last much longer this economic disaster exposed trump administration incompetent frauds accomplishment could point stock market dissolved matter days 
i'm sure state florida early voting reduces size crowds day 
would apointee merrick garland get rule case obama 
it even try obama lost much fire second term 
garland would longer court though we're back square one 
saw nonsense another thread doubt justices make career decisions reading political tea leaves they serve term let politicians handle fall you win elections want appoint moscow mitch made clear need take senate 
by model cdc using state virus expected peak late april early may that's know

he almost certainly would recused

no worries never get tired looking 
of course this country supposed represent folks different stripes i've stopped using terms altogether since 'far left' co opted mean anything someone like sanders 'progressive' presumably make feel lagging behind moral character thus guilt trip voting align centrist stand way progress load malarkey 
we need progressives vision progress always happens center via compromise gotta work together 
lot us feel way certainly liberal maybe even progressive normal standards believe welfare state think government power regulate companies behave hurts people however there's big difference wanting universal healthcare supporting things like cfpb bernie's plan abolish private insurance guarantee federal jobs implement nationwide rent control in liked campaigned idea bringing plans worked countries us he's gone totally deep end proposing part tried autocratic communist liberal socialist distinct identities we're wishy washy extreme policies 
there nothing wrong believing putting aside differences achieve greater good just kid thinking across aisle interest working anyone next name we live world anymore wish gone indication returning anytime soon sadly way get anything done win presidency and houses congress hold several terms otherwise administration simply dismantles everything achieved 
hope much disgression bit surreal watch candidates debate economics health care reforms senate never pass no matter president medicare all land desk even actually people want see questions media asks bring russian interference changed course presidential election us trying the current openly asked aide campaign believes putin intelligence agencies aides abetted majority leader blocking stringent efforts acknowledge stop russia going and withheld defense funding allied nation troops partially occupying wanted prime minister go television announce opening spurious investigation american politician's son involved politics hoping would cause guy's family political scandal how psychopath tell foreign leader democratic country take away weapons let march kiev hang daggonit subvert justice system citizen briefly made year working business it'd score points rival home that's real issue necessarily say misconduct trump impeached directly though house right impeach convicted certainly related need measures make sure stay democracy or close electoral college gerrymandering set give low populated states power allow anyhow do get decide leaders moscow what china wants start counter influence campaigns hacking who's computer psychological manipulation better getting puppet nation's choice lead to policy preserve america's ability select support joe biden that cold war hawks republican party donald tells everything know state party they went mccarthy letting vladimir pick people missing bigger picture think sanders done great job advocating social security healthcare domestic issues last years he's center gravity democratic things mostly its everyone endorses puts forward although used showing creating constituency ideas moderate define views terms talking increase payouts cut helpful good making happen economically progressive nominee we've decades based platform he's articulated part bernie in end though always focused extent thinks often prism sort worldwide leftist movement agrees putin's fact rightly denounced he sounds like we'd signing something dramatic break norms different direction focus provide traditional without excesses bush someone just honest goodness use contain threaten us allies robust attempt strengthen nato alliances knows stuff may remember one started rabid fire technical talk repositioning pacific fleet looked deer caught headlights progress elected he'll try restore way lets already lost many non partisan civil servants fix institutional bureaucracy thing back track 
like idea working across aisle really believe republicans going work biden though 
spoken like someone left really wish rank choice civic ed baby could multi party system people know difference politicians confusingly broad labels 
this individual labels it's i'm centrist progressive the issues start top establishment vs others market crash looking like hoover power how fix back they voted fdr used terms socialist communist describe he popular got elected times set term limits socialist fourth ballot convention finally exit polls consistently showing people want medicare obviously translating well actual votes completely understand someone may moderate idea parties work big real 'malarkey' did forgot much push obama given i'll vote blue matter but disagree saying magically unite together conversation every week coworkers would love worked old days seem gone 
proud liberal somewhat left biden best man job came aboard last november 
bernie served make progressive ideas palatable he lost mainly people unsure could beat trump disliked policies 
also think absolutely okay centrist problem joe he's much 'meh' it's like we're guy run president sake this joe's biggest challenge overcome status 
could elaborate mean trumps fascism 
of course nothing wrong political positons social democrat socailist policies sanders quite right kasisch 
naaayce yep virtue signalling strong one good malarkey detection skills 
civil rights movement gandhi emancipation slavery 
kinda hoping we'd go towards direction multi payer healthcare like germany but i'd rather toward single trump president 
think universal single payer ultimate goal really way guarantee complete coverage everyone also controlling costs current system entrenched giving true public option start seems like smart move given legislation allow negotiate better medicare currently thus make premiums affordable become popular choice eventually take market 
bernie's plan abolish private insurance afaik doesnt he's gone totally deep end proposing things part tried autocratic communist countries liberal socialist distinct identities we're wishy washy supporting extreme policies no sanders proposes case european its normal policy extre elefty positions sanders centre left reality seems far due skewed us politics 
while true focusing hard foreign interference makes us seem demented and younger generations accepting people getting involved us politics its illegal foreigners volunteer campaigns news articles canadians australians working sanders i've seen picture claimed german volunteers well we know russians chinese infiltrate get policy info israel heavily tries influence choices saudi arabia suspected source much current campaign donations hate but americans think world citizens anyone else decide leaders republicans cheer hostile nation targeting enemies nothing punish perpetrators seems lost war 
agree trump literally fascist but broad disdain media habitual factual misrepresentations superficial hyper nationalism traits expect proto fascists patriotism skeptical approach positives opinion takes things ratchets 
okay yes progress happens civil war 
single payer sanders sense banning private insurance actually incredibly rare really nordic countries canada britain gone far he's suggesting even still allow pretty much continental europe multi universal either public option non profits cases like netherlands think making medicare available anyone opt enrolling uninsured people automatically smartest way expand affordable coverage also license federal rather state level companies can't local monopolies 
think universal single payer ultimate goal really way guarantee complete coverage everyone also controlling costs why done public option it'll cheaper private insurance subsidy low income people otherwise afford 
guaranteeing federal jobs implementing nationwide rent control radical policies not commonplace europe ever really done autocratic communist countries rent one things sounds like good idea paper reality band aid fix real issue people moving cities simply enough places live the best solution make single unit zoning laws illegal federally suburbs built vertically least suburban houses divided townhomes this rents lower naturally increasing supply everyone government job also going seriously damage economic growth created regardless whether provide value useful service suck private sector could actually contributing economy bad social democratic liberal perspective limits amount tax revenue available fund welfare state reason sweden able many programs booming use pulling tons public trying massively expand 
understand line thinking i'm younger generation never accept ok countries interfere elections this akin attacking country soil treated 
the thing that's prevented going full fascist courts believe demonstrated pounce opportunity consolidate power arise 
https washingtonmonthly com early warning signs fascism 
public option good middle ground likely best hope going route the areas universal single payer would superior worrying network everywhere accepts medicare right example everyone covered one insurer covering government could set reimbursement rates control costs mandate facilities accept payment full fair providers ideally elected board medical professionals setting taxpayers save quite bit overhead comes billing collections etc see role private insurance still existing system additional rider plans coverage allow upgrade room hospital cover vanity cosmetic procedures 
rent control loads people working gov part normal way eu countries ever really done autocratic communist plese stop nonsene sanders democratic left demorats communists if want look trump acted lot president the reason like sweden able many government programs booming private sector use tax revenue fund its ironic dont see go hand eduated productive healthy workers tend good 
yeah unfortunately foreign interference republican dirty tricks operations like erik prince's operation chaos never know someone real supporter foreigner possibly bad agenda trying fuck things old interviews paid russian bot people say supposed create toxic atmosphere online similar kgb faked race war propaganda the idea use american openness when spreads disinformation might knowingly poison discourse this wary angry political supporters 
blinded incredible opportunity invest chess sets 
blind your conspiracy theories biden covid you regurgitated much nonsense post hard tell exactly upset 
rent control might normal mandated nationwide rent wide scale federal employment guaranteed if government controlled rents would incentive anyone build anything single unit homes bought rented worsening sprawl pollution long commutes furthering neighborhood segregation we want encourage density discourage way make city living affordable encouraging maybe even financially incentivising building high market rate urban housing minneapolis done worked wonders managed grow massively economic standpoint still live need sort growth level on jobs iterate massive bigger planned candidate increase size roll enough work entire workforce people sucked private sector actually create taxable wealth public they'd using this difference venezuela sweden in huge social safety net funded large well taxed tried fund nationalizing big industries namely oil the price crashed keep they're conundrum money pay programs lean lastly say absolutely agree point educated healthy happy good thing welfare state least partially get go hand see i'm saying micromanage industry let unless acts predatory harmful manner produce efficiently skims top schools healthcare etc it's better one generating spending everything 
now talking republicans vs democrats historical debate only democratic candidates selected notify purchase additional pieces 
think bigger picture it biden covid lizard people creating distractions distracting us existence understand hard see first start seeing stop 
rent control might normal mandated nationwide rent when look belgium form mandated natioanwide you cant without reason improved value house wide scale federal employment guaranteed provide incentives green deal infrastructure creating work your comparison venezuala pure freamongering nothig want see i'm saying roll state micromanage industry let thing unless acts predatory harmful manner produce wealth efficiently skims top fund schools healthcare etc people it's better private sector one generating public welfare spending government everything sanders doesnt propose ecept perhaps health care something special hence he's really socialist problem describe

they probably correct number chance seems pretty line predictions but mean trump beat odds keep mind excellent year far 
unlikely things still happen odds trump winning perfect storm bad allowed win means low probability 
would play round russian roulette you chance dying 
they gave around odds higher major forecaster 
trump winning greatest political upset time if gave anything genius 
in fairness always long biden bernie short everyone else 
do know probability works predict hillary would chance beat trump 
chance vs hmm yeah equal 
then add pete's amy's delegates 
the rules road make better 
gen joe biden voter one know guess person voting democratic primary 
none said really democrats tired and vilify far strong word he's piggy backed democratic primaries many god damned times tosses aside longer needs 
no see argument medicare particular true pretty much western world still private health insurance canada france australia uk widespread what biden offering closer rest public system safety net make sure everyone gets form healthcare matter unlike bernie's proposal stands chance actually making congress 
seizing every big company without compensation normal western countries that one actual policies jeremy corbyn got blown uk milder policy also banning stock buybacks codetermination federal charters revoked executive etc sanders extremely left wing number counts and universal healthcare single payer singapore we the system mix private public health insurance plays minimal role spend gdp among best outcomes world 
that hard left chose bernie warren absolute embarrassment does one bother compare legislative accomplishments do people want get anything done 
yeah love right want get hopes much still bit raw pete dropping 
depends stakes but good point though 
lol yeah theyre gonna start decimal 
do deligates candidates dropped get transferred 
yep this sub visit days lol rest site utter garbage thats coming someone used spend time probably hundreds subs way back day great 
universal healthcare mean private insurances gone it means supplemental insurance canada france uk definately use main the nhs safety net its almost residents entitled only people living provate so i'm really sire getting idea system based and bernies plan likely pass kinda point we literally behind curve becuase socialism bad even though call works countries 
seizing every big company without compensation normal western countries that one actual policies kinda the government wouldnt seizing corporation would set aside controlled workers like built union while radical germany somewhat similar law elect members onto board directors and universal healthcare single payer didnt say 
seizing every big company without compensation normal western countries that one actual policies it sounds like tax 
no pete amy suspended campaigns meaning delegates distributed if chose allow would go candidates viable iowa nh hence biden the nv allowed whatever reason 
visit innocent subs woodworking blacksmithing powerwashingporn many far away politics boogaloo 
in canada healthcare expenditure privately funded french system literally government run health insurance akin public option proposal us except compulsory fully reimburse medical costs hybrid private given france possibly best world uk nhs provide services comprehensive sanders' plan continues underperform industry resulting growing numbers britons taking bernie's completely destroy replace publically simply consistent approach countries taken idea constructed four years realistic unless serious corners going cut if aware pass congress get behind agree western nations america needs reality we're gonna able incrementally way biden provides stepping stone future presidents improve expand bernie bitter political deadlock congress probably drive people back republicans ultimately kill hope reform least decade 
codetermination different worker share ownership the government would expropriating handing workers value existing shares drop okay codetermination rather accept even preferred system sander plan allows companies shut executive though harm community employees 
expropriation wealth tax would also hard with shares nefarious people robbed ownership well

joe biden wins endorsement of machinists union after rare rank and file vote vote versus sen bernie sanders vt donald trump took ballots cast 
yet another reason biden must nominee bernie loses even union members trump 
for anyone else wondering looks like they'll separate vote later general election the new process require multiple steps beginning members voting online candidate either republican democratic primary leaders union political arms state weigh based picks after super tuesday make endorsement primaries blessing national executive council parties nominated delegates convention september it's forgone conclusion ultimately endorse nominee martinez said likely intervene decide president donald trump https www politico com story machinists 
berners like say union members get vote they'll bernard well pick 
they know trump guy stiffs workers moves jobs overseas crappy ties right 
this issue leaves conflicted i'm adjunct professor union horribly ineffective fight get suspect cost job think need let unions compete like every service provider believe freedom association collective bargaining lot policies strengthen strengths employees might want replace so directly relevant op vote join give bigger piece tiny paycheck as fee payer cannot law go towards political activities fund activity agree 
strange endorsement like virtually biden endorsements buried arr politics 
bernie morphed message back need union its conflicting groups operate inside market economy 
misleading take presumably democrats would coalesce together one trump 
give unions created equal my dad united steelworker active union his fought tooth nail members dad's employer contract negotiations every two years always huge fight the wanted cut health benefits pensions get rid holiday pay etc and never able also incredible diagnosed cancer they collected money week brought us make exception allow inherit pension died 
also unions separate optional fee political activities 
that's right left authoritarian handbook how terrifying 
see would easy slide way view world completely broken unjust you dream ideals things totally discount limitations humanity big companies fall trap start thinking therefore anything everything 
clean sweep every county missouri 
mississippi join everycountygang michigan might https twitter com redistrict status 
moving kansas city canvass joe august edit the one missouri like trump thinks 
that's good look man like 
missouri represent this state need show people ask joe switch seats 
one november repeat please love state hard like sometimes 
tonight bittersweet night not joe see many voters like hillary voted she terrible candidate would made amazing president

remember first time heard warren speak cnn town hall probably year ago first spoke maybe amy bernie get approx polls point much better she lucid engaged quick witted knew stuff incredible also way dealt bloomberg fantastic surprised boost encounter due primary states order the combination personal hero mine joe biden running warren's policies step far left meant never truly supported phenomenal politician kinda think cabinet role allowed run department rather one face senate

seconded team pete went thing last week know feels give space grieve bombarding help 
what patriot it definitely reminded important us vote if could late work 
don't forget official emoji combo 
think biden's policy lot progressive realize his platform gets gaslight really hard bernie supporters saying he want change anything etc 
also like tone messaging camp ton ritualistic sacrifice anyone might disagree we even accept future former republicans single dem vote need part win country back unite fact want functional government de politisize state justice dept allie democratic nations dictatorships 
still understand idea bernie can't win biden polls better trump much biden's debating skills fallen little since he's gaffe prone something good exploiting not mention sanders rust belt overall well home state texas two areas could single handedly decide election

welcome lot us pete supporters biden camp extremely welcoming know we've kept sub would assume well helped still space the world un coalition decency welcome aboard 
of course this good thing say although hopefully necessary unlike candidates' supporters make demands 
voted liz oklahoma tuesday torn joe decided wanted election show place ideas bernie holy shit are pete quickly decide next choice vote you basically summed decision making right voting lol 
this much supported bernie the bros pushed lot voters away like name calling general toxicity when warned losing black vote got angry basically told us bad denied problem outright so went warren time saw use racist language pocahontas trump refer people uneducated blaming bernie's primary losses can't control bros biden supporters diligently working together without tearing results differences super tuesday 
as someone leans left biden pete supporter take lot solace extremely unlikely joe would stop progressive legislation passed house senate truly believe country bernie odd sounds this type coalition win seats presidency 
proud american presidency stop allowing working class exploited catch rest world support bernie he's consistent inspiring confident anyone else he'll fight everyman given insistence refuse money billionaires super pacs personally consider our revolution pac since grass movement understand criticism 
volunteered holding signs day got shake hand there couple hundred us shook hands thank even though driver someone sure rush get going town hall it sounds cheesy say wonderful moment really hope ranked choice voting takes people like pick sides 
i'm also overjoyed support biden liking pete primary contest shows joe one win across country unite party believe coalition that's growing rock solid beat trump hold unity 
this actually great fair question heard i'll try give answer later goes without saying he'd clean house trump appointed partisan scum hacks replace good progressives since he's political realm long years white house experience might one biggest strengths 
think page much looking https joebiden com governmentreform 
hey welcome this great question given warren hallmark something biden necessarily emphasized enough campaign trail might looking policies structural government reform https joebiden com governmentreform utm source share medium ios app name iossmf 
https joebiden com governmentreform is i'd start guess good question though 
corruption cancer eats away citizen's faith democracy diminishes instinct innovation creativity already tight national budgets crowding important investments it wastes talent entire generations scares jobs joe biden may romania fighting corruption good governance it's self defense patriotism nov long trump announced run president biden talking government 
oh hell even week later naturally going link pete's policies 
corruption touches lot individual subjects heck effects everything campaigns address individually think warren unique focusing corruption specific whereas candidates look related proposals plans for example plan criminal justice reform biden talks wanting doj committed investigating malpractice police prosecutor level 
also addition existing plans i'd imagine staffers new supporters migrating campaigns start enhance promote complements biden's platforms next weeks 
thank lot respect warren must awful news today 
think joe needs work reaching bernie supporters point least feel herd their issues important warrant thoughtful discourse but bust numbers nearly great combination centerest republican get plus non voters would rally 
indeed welcome let talk either way 
yes the fact joe said wants one term huge plus 
bernie populist policies he's favorable senator washington appeals young people better anyone else he average debator both biden likely beat trump given biden's gaffes lack luster debate performances lead believe chance 
what polling numbers say best chance trumo 
it's like supporters allergic unity 
personally single issue 'defeat trump' voter many reasons importantly supreme court appointments two trump nominees means literally years zero progressive laws ever upheld data simple like rcp general election polling average results suggests biden particular moderates generally best choice purpose the notion ideologically pure candidates win purple elections driving turnout proven blatantly false time rs ds to difference joe bernie astronomically tiny compared either policy differences really relevant given sweeping legislative change blocked senate current anyway personally opinion optimally government completely charge healthcare also strong system impossible enact country's politics important better chance movement right direction 
chose biden think president bernie offer respect bernies views mfa need someone true leadership we work congress get things passed restore america standing world relationships allies back track what joe said election soul really resonated deliver beyond policy one left 
his policies here good official overview joe's vision america https joebiden com joes vision think barack obama gave compelling description joe who seconds youtu ecl pulkqie 
my policy reasons supporting biden mostly foreign the isolationist anti trade policies bernie good opinion especially world china russia emerging direct competitors us we need leader willing work countries think cares stage from non perspective i'll echo others said biden's ability people lot complained establishment backing that's much specific members congress come solutions would imagine become president send bills desk he'd refuse sign even certainly progress things correct direction ultimately president's enact limited executive orders trust whether controlled republicans democrats 
former warren supporter voted mail day nevada's primary i've never prouder support candidate president i'm supporting joe hashtag bluenomatterwho also like learned stutter https www theatlantic com magazine archive joe biden profile watched obama award medal freedom hot take feel campaign wrapped monday bernie get vote point likely scenarios put solid plurality votes unless something crazy happens 
want take different tack responses say one reasons support joe love warren he fundamentally decent resilient person afraid emotionally vulnerable stands after talked faith means cnn town hall leave room cry little bit every time talks beau you see face change anyone describes loss tragedy stops candidate becomes father lost kids far the man wants live son asked deathbed promise dad strength empathy exhibits wake much personal something know could but gives hope not future country good white house people folks like biden exact kind need restore soul nation would proud vote forneither i'm pretty annoyed written unceremoniously going away she's inspiration 
think first thing see positive change get trump white house joe best positioned also disappointed toxicity vitriol coming sanders campaign congress one tasked creating legislation i'm sure medicare all bill makes biden would sign so let's work voting progressives senate 
believe bernie would actually take country towards socialism and ain't talking medicare i'm federal jobs guarantee giving ownership control major corporations employees sanders win give ton momentum socialist movement someone believes capitalism really want see assuming last time runs socialists without figure rally behind think whole thing recede bernie's supporters also they've become toxic 
simple bernie election would cause civil war the rights socialism rhetoric talking many trump supporters lot believe progressive wing democratic party real enemy america split along ideological lines may necessary they view campaign assault constitution independent particularly like candidates receptive farther left ideas reason rest developed world us however also want best cycle need someone heal try bring bipartisanship back biden capable 
first know biden want government provide public option subsidized poor continue reforming healthcare the exciting thing he's really team player if read campaign website find constantly elevating solutions proposed politicians think coalition building extremely effective it'll less trying shape people giving extra support this gives democratic party pretty good chance getting awful lot done presidency 
because biden history working collaboratively others sanders as former warren guy ability build successful coalition absolutely key uniting democrats everything i've seen shows incapable 
biden dementia joe fully released medical records neuro cognitive disorders struggled debilitating speech disorder since child mostly overcame here's absolutely great article struggles https www google com amp theatlantic re bad debate performances one theory read comment reddit neoliberal comments fe ae joe attacked media fjmk sucks debating friends can't get mean knowledge never really serious dem opponent lot harder well enemies he run allys stage think compelling like he's big hearted guy words little comes criticizing democratic party allies but that's again fact status disability nothing highly recommend 
we'll see rust belt coming claim bernie better texas lost joe and bloomberg even 
really think people need get debate thing debates usually fail move electorate unless something like warren bloomberg moment better lot places supertuesday and seen trump talk clinton metrics destroyed far debates go so much still remember puppet puppet you're america also done nicknames it energize biden working class voters especially pa minnesota florida tx the black vote come record numbers even bigger anything bernie brought while rallies worse terms turnout he expand base young stayed home 
how work exactly on campaign site says use peer system does mean receiving texts call see actual number different one 
already getting private attack messages bro thanks making choice easier guys 
feel like everyone assumed tons money staff since name recognition yang said bloomberg hired staffers maybe working biden 
meant useless terms volunteering come halt state still voted hope biden takes ideas ending corruption financial regulations

i'm like twelve fifteen pete groups i'd really count pulling overwhelming numbers least fb albeit anecdotally couple people jews group going bloomberg can't fault wanting jewish candidate even well real bernie sound supporters trend progressive par course given wide pete's spread political spectrum wise on hand republicans for also dems independents imo one best hands seems all in joe point i've seen members saying fence they're thinking changing minds value members' opinions much lot reasoning expected block sanders idea say based impression biden would want us unify behind we've got respect opinion matter obvious reasons i'll camp awful last couple days genuinely think alone pushed edge at ones already totally fed crap but vultures swarming downright lying treating morons 
pete joe supporter think expect majority active supporters online there liked progressive policies cared less rhetoric shifting sanders seen one two sure genuine most us disgusted way bernie bros treated logical transition 
feel this last midterm cycle nebraska senator elections district's rep shoein down ballot pretty much one person county commish 
don't forget early voting yes absentee ballots ny suck if stay registered summer i'll take weekend trip congressional primary rather dealing had ballot barely made town volunteer swing state 
pete biden preferring going give vote shot turn probably first years ago still sharp endorse heard take huge grain salt might attending event soon sanders pretty strange ideas would nominee okay know system checks balances but candidate thinking good able accomplish policy the mystery obama endorsed he like sanders incredible help 
matches everything i've seen furthest left supporters shifting bernie honestly godspeed maybe talk sense nahhh overwhelming rest biden 
it's extreme poor form former president endorse race certain if obama endorses biden god forbid bernie wins hands trump massive weapon spend rest campaign telling everyone sees even want dem candidate win people vote presidents almost never risk wrong endorsement they general elections primaries 
that makes lot sense thanks 
all aboard no malarkey express 
want vw van still vote biden why 
love bernie driving hippie bus 
cant say like cartoon paints biden impolite man think better would running flat tires iowa nh nevada then clyburn helps giving new tire south carolina pete amy park cars also help get biden's bus gently roll past bernie 
an old jewish man driving german vehicle 
same love vw buses hope electric one expensive comes probably 
i've always secretly wanted vw van also wish el camino would make comeback as homeowner sometimes pickup nice better gas easier drive small female but no malarkey express room all democrats 
but lie love cars can get one biden 
hush mouth heathen some vw buses window worth hundreds thousands if ever win lottery buying on january volkswagen samba sold becoming valuable van auction jul 
because fjg direction america going period also college free needs cheaper think agree universal healthcare see different ways dealing bernie support private option disagree union worker shouldnt lose yes i've used calculator gonna making losing money also buy alzheimers claims people nitpicking slips every rubs wrong way people share stuttering excuse the man speech impediment whole life i'm sure looking actual conversation i'll give upvote anyways 
sounds like pretty touch american population it one thing disagree prefer someone else slightest clue maybe realise reality 
my jewish grandmother refused ride german car entire post wwii life it common sentiment among survivors families but please continue pretending know first thing world 
why college free it used extremely cheap better educated competent workforce beneficial society including trade industry training well 
the union hilarious many workers support bernie also would general population let ruin chances health care biden get anything done education healthcare so even based points see 
do think conventional though good indication thought american population well informed 
my grandpa like boycotting anything german everyone else family generation loves cars music products dad married woman 
know i've got get read said think college cheaper since take minute blind bias since we're talking benefits society people money line likely work but scientific source grain salt convince otherwise friend 
when ever say taking healthcare away reread want universal and would rather remain current student debt completely free don't pick choose read 
ah see americans want bernie sanders must stupid keep lecturing voters dumb sure convince but get point arguing whether biden good candidate saying makes completely touch clue might liked the answered continue used clueless guess you remind media complete meltdown trump figure 
there brainers don't vote grifter trotskyist just something unpopular mean good idea 
ya win year olds it shame young people talk action least showed vote unlike twitter socialists 
and sanders generation right just go away 
and said free misquote your argument people debt getting education otherwise work they drive bring income i'd say levels playing field rich poor lets get earlier start things like buying house providing family my dad went ucla bucks semester used 
why would rather remain current student debt 
well actually pretty successful say americans want also talking polls so you get point wondering popular opinion never anything right that assuming numbers even reliable considering voter suppression manipulation etc 
implying something unpopular good idea one saying popularity nothing inherently value you knob also trotskyism thing reductive bs and agree brainless buy way stop trying brain things start 
lmaooooo its rigged that bernie losing duh voter suppression also hurts black voters go biden want argue bernies support goes or maybe america don hit head ceiling way 
how voter suppression affect bernie please explain without vague wishy washy anger blaming loss rigged every time embarrassing 
ask truly believe level playing field that systemic bias but regarding voter suppression demographics targets disproportionately bernie contingency it complicated you know specific right 
aware voter suppression exists asking disproportionally affects bernie voters please provide literally reasoning evidence saying 
this gets pissed bernie supporters say wont vote biden nomination especially point ppl deal less ideal candidate years american wilderness naturally forming american monuments you fuck gone good 
bernie supporters tell care america youth healthcare neighbor vote actually voting biden makes sense 
just one gripe we're voting treat lgbt people dignity like know crazy happens every day easy forget mike pence vice president united states supports conversion therapy literal physical emotional torture children 
whenever someone says vote get nominated mention ruth bader ginsberg currently years old that sentence alone enough blue november matter 
mind voting biden trump smear get four years 
he married gay couple think past issue matters much anymore 
you may joking case publicly accidentally imo intentionally mentioned support gay marriage vp obama supported directly led obama's public shortly thereafter see article https www politico com story obama expected speak edit nyt piece gets details nytimes magazine president got sex html 
but also mention trump gets another term clarence thomas oldest conservative court would likely retire order allow replace younger justice that solidify court generation 
but trump smear sanders he whoever nominee 
biden clearly cognitive decline it obvious he ill prepared candidate take trump would put money sanders thousands times how vote man who's entering beginning stages dementia alzheimer's 
no actually clearly cognitive decline sanders one ill prepared learned nothing election cycle young voters reliable and attacking everyone party establishment turning around expecting support lunacy he even beat biden states supposed win like maine massachusetts minnesota sweep south key northern bernie wants blame corrupt billionaire loss dismisses voices countless trying bring side ostracize on top broke heading super tuesday many people mail voting before endorsements bloomberg siphoned cotes away otherwise would bigger blowout cases texas argument electable turn soundly disproven his policies far left never get congress shows willingness compromise either at least liz warren acknowledged wanted lose health insurance already way highway divisive lashed needs general never trump face facts 
see decided completely dodge whole biden mental decline comment nice nah the media engaged desperate smear campaign bernie sanders ever since elections started criticism incessant continues today can't count many times i've seen talking heads crucify guys like joe decieved voters believing attempting medicare worth of course reverberating effect president sought would impossible ignore his policies far left nearly every modern civilized nation planet adopted want improve health care wants stick band aid can't really fix amputated arm aslo advocate federal legalization marijuana how vote still support baffling federally illegal policy deeply rooted racist politics authoritarianism plenty established research publically available short long term effects excuse stance pandering right wing mark words lose we staring loaded double barrel inevitably another years trump to perfectly honest currently best dnc provide representation leaving party permanently this entire repeat i'm done corruption system cannot work us 
dodged addressed first sentence it false just stated make fact mark words biden lose you wrong currently best dnc provide representation leaving party vote permanently bye this entire campaign repeat i'm done corruption system cannot work us ahh yes people exercise right want corrupt sounds like excuses but savior bernie offer well blame establishment failure turn build coalition 
so took substantive information explained tossed window you realize that's argument works right i've corruption votes falling biden done anything refute idk address biden's mental decline said nope true that's 
joe biden twitter senator ewarren fiercest fighters middle class families her work washington massachusetts campaign trail made real difference people's lives we needed voice race need continued senate

if agree ideology go vote someone else it democracy 
we vote hrc primary think lot moderates especially san diego 
delegates proportional vote count california big anyone write it's huge state lot far left people there's tons mainstream democrats even lots conservatives 
guess get enough people know like jerry brown pretty reasonable think trump scrambled people's brains lower information default opposite anything considered conservative matter principle it policies working follow correlate outcomes voting 
would rather go negative bernie nominee lose trump 
well moderate strategy work hilary 
biden today st louis rally to amy folks pete kamala beto tell gigantic difference made we gonna unite party country 
kamala's huh i'm guessing that's next endorsement 
didn't know biden worked msnbc sad yang gang sounds 
accountability to people got in my politics shocking stan time joe mentions pete anyway 
guessing kamala he mention warren 
pretty classy respect warren's decision endorse anyone yet 
wouldn mind kamala demmings vp but excellent statement united stand 
possibly waiting one come sure soon but also tbf supporters made biden migration long time ago first us 
think may meant someone dropped suporters voted biden personally dont thonk endoresement makes diff inthe states voting next weeks 
wonder that's endorsement alluded yesterday evening 
gay however pete front would strongly reconsider previously said 
i'm straight male except pete 
would say maybe mentioning endorsers kamala maybe endorsement mentioned yesterday slip 
that guess thing makes sense would big national figure like pelosi obama could hrc think bringing new voters 
gay pete i'm married going work 
i'm sure gang never passes chance manufacture blackout accusations saying someone still loyal gang happily voting biden twice 
hrc might hurt help honest love need national popularity levels surprised even get speaking part convention it'll first day 
could yang gang split candidates notice didnt mention warren supporters either whereas pete beto think amy went heavily biden wouldn't surprise kamala just wondering maybe want bunch pissed bernie stans yelling 
yang gang even split whether keep voting 
joe lockhart twitter the democratic establishment delivering wins biden voters blacks latinos suburban women college educated working class it's insulting suggest coerced 
the ''democratic establishment'' boogey man like trump uses ''deep state'' 
the democratic establishment delivering wins biden tonight voters blacks latinos suburban women college educated working class it's insulting suggest coerced tweet publisher joelockhart

starting think sanders supporters believe anyone job establishment 
yep the venn diagram conspiracy nonsense trumpster bros demographics really freaking crowded right they blame media everything cite establishment elites eventually deep state well 
personally think that's targetted audience fan base voted biden i'm part younger age demographic bernie honest works us we want quick information sound bites flashy images leading believe get social media value acceptance vote you need actually go out gain benefit appearance at end day many group going choosing candidate best serve it's sharing facebook instagram hyped feel like we're smart cool kids' crew if manages offer image bet jump ship just source millenial living sf area life 
mean that's kinda hate pete much he looks sounds like someone job 
establishment another word 'not agreeing aoc bernie sanders radical left' biden's win really transformed atmosphere until today basically given thought conquering democratic party i'm glad people showed wrong lost 
that's pretty much word used originally bernie biden teenagers

peter baker at moment markets wiped roughly percent gains entire trump presidency 
when learn simply throwing gasoline economy nothing grow long term 
the fact thought simply hiding would save stock market ridiculous of course inevitably drop bit something like happens trump handled terribly this public information since january probably known december yet still hardly testing kits as soon became clear china virus contained cranking south korea managed mitigate crisis well overall mortality rate global average preventing spread means give individual patients better care we emulating they're pretending everything fine 
another economy ruined republican democrat fix 
dude want see shit i'm trying forget much money lost goddamn 
hey trump supporters winning yet you lost pretty much every gain since congrats 
proof dem conspiracy know people think coronavirus etc 
it's almost like way tries build economy highly unstable emphasizes business consumer meaning something affected base know pandemic stuff starts falling apart 
when crumbling anyway make worse 
his comments cruise ship true know saying loud crap in moment alone communicated public any way seems like throwing bus would help even hour endanger without hesitation 
every lie tell incurs debt truth 
the gop like bunch shitty teenagers parents go town trash house wreck car run credit cards then complain money things they know grownups fix its strategy 
let's honest much whats happening right would happen regardless president trump making worse handling virus abominable tons reasons well oil price war global pandemic things almost certainly happened hillary white house market responding similarly albeit probably less severely 
and democrat largely fix get zero credit another years republicans voted back amass even power ultimately ruin economy 
right also wonder many businesses individuals go bankrupt closures cancellations 
do think iran italy china pretend places 
funny thinking chernobyl series earlier today especially party meeting scene old man tells contain spread misinformation they'll remembered heroes can't imagine world people live think ignoring something hiding make go away 
new rasmussen poll yes biden beating trump 
some highlights in hypothetical matchup last september trump edged biden would beat sanders outspoken socialist seven points presidential election held today clearly seen likable candidate forty eight percent voters view favorably unfavorably but favorable regard this includes very favorable unfavorable one 
he beat trump that guarantees electoral college victory 
the polls say we're going win need work hard order make sure outcome happens we can't repeat 
somehow doubt trump tweets one 
wondering recession come would trump lose way goldwater lyndon johnson seems like possibility 
i'd vote wind toy bellhop monkey clapping symbols trump 
if economy continues dive gg 
we need flood zone positive ads joe chainsaw level attack trump fifteen states actually matter if bloomberg drops billion dollars fundraise like crazy and definitely boost senate candidates colorado maine north carolina montana 
likely worst case scenario democrats https www towin com maps zlkx narrow win xorkz decisive ervz absolute landslide yjrky 
he win michigan wisconsin florida ohio those states matter thanks electoral college 
the thus far good economy really thing keeping trump polling mid you talk conservative full hate immigrants eventually say supporting that's gonna change quick retirees start seeing ks tanking 
confused thought talking subject line 
and kentucky georgia south carolina 
and definitely need boost senate candidates colorado maine north carolina montana arizona south kentucky 
if think going get ohio florida paying close attention 
if biden wins michigan likely arizona currently beating trump north carolina need wisconsin florida ohio 
wisconsin going tough removed rolls 
his handling coronavirus sure help sure right effects every home continues prioritizing damn cruise ship companies american populous deaths start piling look terrible part 
would much rather waste money kentucky south carolina 
biden bearing trump last polls ohio in florida 
populace noun fyi populous adjective sorry guy 
where seeing ohio poll the last one find october 
just ready flip quite yet give years people move sun belt 
if kentucky somehow flipped would cry tears joy having lived life agree probably focus major dollars elsewhere 
how know genuine question are polls say 
yeah people saw governor go blue really indicative presidential voting patterns as long medicare protected local level electing democrat fine vote someone gut federal weird phenomenon 
i've looked realclearpolitics fivethirtyeight see polls either kentucky south carolina found mcgrath mcconnell neck january https www politico com id da ff and found harrison graham december changeresearch post south carolina courier poll december know enough speak quality say i'm finding show there's chance what looking

beware we active trolling sub new supporters welcome please listen ridiculous negativity

secretary state mean need guy clean fucking mess trump made 
anyone would lucky buttigieg cabinet he's smart speaks several languages experience military intelligence 
one finest minds politics use well joe 
pete vp would unify party beyond belief wish much dream young old straight gay moderate progressive intelligence heart diversity vote biden white skin color gender factor balancing ticket wrong reasons known worse choosing ideal combination caring human beings 
nice figured much still nice he gave special spot well 
thinking maybe chief staff speaks pete's background administrator opportunity see washington works close would help pete network 
dhs cos pretty likely secdef sos much given experience levels i'm honestly hoping way power lot people think 
secretary state please make imagine better person present us trying times 
in another era pete would obvious vp choice days ticket must balanced he'll happy cabinet position 
booty judge chief but seriously think pete could lot good place takes within biden administration 
really liked joe buttigieg know much even though live close state glad got learn leaned toward biden thought stood better chance vs trump sanders truly hope get cast ballet president one day 
love much heart biden although finally found resolution low enough actually make look bad 
i'd happy see pete secretary state ambassador un national security advisor 
love idea sending gay secretary state saudi arabia russia forcing treat partner state ceremony 
plus languages speaks he's great role 
that veep honestly joe need help minority vote having pete would let learn presidency first hand set really well run next time 
while cos would fit fairly well pete's skillset largely thankless job tends consume person's time soul think biden sees getting pete administration help build resume bit he'll want slot visible yet flexible position likely flavor secretary deputy really good feel best state might little station point promoting diplomat within org look next interior labor energy bad education great everyone's clear slotting actual educator at end day pulled onboard special advisor involved varied portfolio 
dhs would odd one not necessarily bad i'd think decide feel 
no that's largely go nowhere position 
see pete russian linguists flight meet putin walks airplane downloaded brain like matrix 
an intelligence officer embarrass us 
have ever heard time pete actually already addressed someone asked he'd handle deal homophobic countries like saudi arabia went soooooo exaggerated shrug they're gonna get used iconic what legend 
he would also youngest person ever appointed secretary state 
think putin even mbs matter particularly cares homosexuality personal basis 
we already germany neoliberal former foreign minister guido westerwelle 
holy moly would ever delicious 
and would help young people 
abrams helps putting georgia play otherwise needs tap someone like tammy baldwin give little progressive flavor ticket 
or hud let economy urban parts south bend rest country 
could see hud energy commerce he huge policy wonk anything get hands impact infrastructure development big 
fyi interior secretary always westerner considering federal government controls half land lot western states causes animosity feds would insensitive joe nominated pete head that one cabinet portfolio definitely table 
dhs mainly intelligence related highest level ones expect career operative years experience the secdef sos sot cia director dni posts really want someone community forever new enough one kind expectation that's also reason think chief staff likely younger driven individuals seem place part yes see alot involved policy great training position presidency 
pete history making go nowhere positions somewhere he going great elevate position ends 
if he's vp secretary state energy might awesome choice slot somewhere lets go climate change one signature causes he'd 
ah good point i'd forgotten thanks pointing 
has cos literally ever gone become president though like disagree experience point view politically i'd concerned re dhs that's fair actually full transparency trump's ice tried get uncle deported ice's failure stopped new york government aggressively interfered there's automatic jump whole brain always leaves reflexive bad taste mouth my gut reaction something along lines pete good want 
but va secretary say someone whose entire family career disaster waiting happen they never last they're liked inherit blame point goes back generations practically pretty much universally despised throw salt wound basically invisible wider public half time the absolutely needs totally rehabbed top bottom want see pete blamed poor policy excess backlog dates bush administration personally 
climate change interesting area consider think responsibility federal level split across multiple agencies departments though this might great opportunity set special advisor czar spearheading effort it would huge task and lot minefields tiptoe republicans internally members congress but could huge win he's able pull one two big items within biden's first term 
organizations take tone guy top think would good thing dhs as cos going become president really pretty much always congresspeople governors very rarely anyone else pete get elected indiana time soon best spot experience point view influence usefulness biden which consider having driven disciplined intelligent individual help direct day operations support desired objectives important 
this good point maybe one like idea elevating historically lower profile position 
and sounds never funded properly thus ensuring struggles

that made think pete transfer remaining donations biden campaign 
butti donor threw biden sc i'm broke college student can't much bucks absolute confidence joe one need right 
glad join team never thought board joe biden let fucking 
kicked joe after organizing working pete that amazing experience 
well shit you made feel heck lot better said so much change day now bloomberg would step aside 
exactly need unite behind actual democrat civil decent but willing fight and wish pete convinced tonight amy beto behind joe candidate us victory 
heard going pay staffers salaries health care another month super thoughtful mind donation support think transfer everything anyway 
that's interesting question if officially ticket biden even legally or would considered donation therefore subject limits 
not step aside also unite bloomberg supporters going bernie lol and bullshit money good fuck we take billion please thank mike 
guess creating pac super done 
there's definitely limit candidate transfers not sure vp selection would affect situation legal perspective my guess pete's folks could rename committee something like win the era committee spend money cycle nothing else 
there's crazy news coming constantly since saturday's sc primary pete started match unity feel like holy crap what's next imagine incredible democrat we're seeing right prompts bloomberg step away race tomorrow and throw support behind biden saying he's proven takes estimation beat trump say ad buys field offices joe's mean i'd shocked also glued see pundits flip collective shit 
oh yes no yes sorry i'm midwestern by step aside mean drop bankroll campaign please thank 
it norm done just fyi especially young guy resources long political career ahead maybe think pete bank much money future expect many us likewise rallied behind distant 
haha in seriousness ive given larger share net worth pete biden bloomberg drop bucket mill billion the exact giving 
next time one kid playground can't transfer funds previous race 
he possibly target certain ballot elections one ways push agenda build network 
and claim im big money fundraising becuase already cash established network donors hypocrisy 
appears we've played carry sir 
joe biden knowledge first vp come support gay marriage people stated would hurt obama election bid 
oh biden first administration official people thought might get dumped instead convinced obama correct course this moral leadership

this official story biden made statement without administration consent obama aides quite irked since planned shift position several months later build party convention previously counseled president avoid issue lest key catholic voters offended https en wikipedia org wiki joe 
how far we've come trump fans attacking likely democratic candidate saying mental physical decline soon kill vocal slice progressives dem meanwhile bernie repeats stump speech enters cardiac arrest returns bros anyone vote man ignores youth intentionally murders tens thousands americans

joe biden apparent winner washington democratic primary nbc news reports 
now time bernie drop for health supporters democrats 
i'd say health voters even bernie dropped local stuff vote 
the th exceptionally poorly run nd caucus voting sites limited hours extremely low turnout 
local stuff tends lower turnout though 
bernie pathetically asked donations yesterday honestly think trying scrounge whatever money leave if run convention and seen lot people sub saying nobody worry they really seem dislike biden 
that's voters just bernie's well vote 
uh point disease less spread people 
voting fine people take precautions 
if that's case ohio carried

merch purchases considered campaign donations can't foreign money election that's also merch count toward total donation limit 
former bernie employee using virtual phonebank tool call voters tell joe biden dementia live streaming we cut little bit figured worth everyone seeing stuff action 
do people want beat trump bernies go ahead try bring many camp damaging potential democratic nominee lies helps 
this going hurt bernie it reveals devious liars people already skeptical so else campaign lying edit think may actually hand debate us 
woooooooooooooow went bernie pete bc behavior when dropped endorsed biden sure would vote days saw ads targeted towards still spoke friends coworkers started waffle wonder this reeeeally cementing joe 
he made video private case anyone looking looks like hours deleted 
lol hope worth getting sued 
gotta ever get student loans paid 
keep positive the sanders camp death throes aggressive completely trashed warren things never deserved you win don't stoop level let tantrums fade 
been defending joe friends family since super tuesday most know policies negative things hear don afraid defend 
the end goal many stick establishment it's bullying tactics used tea party trump supporters squash dissent 
obviously can't know many convinced section amongst would much prefer biden lose vs trump scenario preserve unknowable bragging right bernie beaten two times keeping ideologically purity intellectual superiority 
bernie fanatical supporters legitimately give two fucks beating trump 
i've personally came certain conclusions that's whatever but bernie going full negative earn votes i'll make moderates feel shunned his campaign staff extremely dumb they're cutting throats 
do think trump negative towards biden bernie still playing soft compared say the dnc fucking making easy option change debate rules they're debating 
but lying think telling truth 
man disappoints campaign it really disservice many supporters stuff like 
is something get sued or law the answers questions yes imo know laws around election interference pretty date 
finding real job obviously consideration 
blaming failures life governments lack loan forgiveness basically mantra 
you realize harassing people giving personal information internet right this mean comment it breaks several laws 
agreed we need focus empathy people gone deep end yet there still plenty good sanders supporters show respect even admiration willingness fight better future 
they would love telling people mean 
as bernie supporter would support joe biden general that's way goes defeating trump primary objective got elected enough country dissatisfied democrats poor trade deals aca failed address needs poorer rural americans voted outsider thought fix lied obviously surprise i'm concerned addressing issues allowed gain much popularity we'll see someone else promising clean house soon the hit many people's wallets hard that affordable still result costly co pays high deductibles expansion bandaid resolve think better solution unfortunately focusing reactive proactive i'd like talk solutions instead bigot must stopped costs 
it's person let go sanders campaign so really hold much blame russians conservative trolls trying split country i've seen people tell others bernie bust and ive lots comments super tuesday megathread spam fuck warren day old accounts they're obvious sure could done better job inoculating followers dont think to primary process seem democratic vulnerable though say made improvements compared lot supporters see may able till leaves politics my point anyhow joe's movement still use support take trump strong mandate doubt joe pander want alienate moderate independants november need feeling listened that understand grievances some pretty legitimate like income inequality hasnt decreased us even democratic presidents 
because reasonable expect know better there wealth debunking information topic they think lie 
this politics division leads populism calls people action drawing fear anger line us that inevitably draws hardliners strong morals guiding principles 
depends fake whether sued definitely worth doubt guy assets seize it illegal use voter registration data anything authorized electioneering 
we loan forgiveness that insane you pay discretionary income years gone forgiven yes means make time less making little and public service get of course issues recently types loans people trying early process anyone taken since issue sure payments certified student debt but working paid pslf 
talking this dude deserves face law i'm online it's going much better smile way victory apologize more stating opinion 
give trump four years packing courts young conservatives kiss goodbye hope enacting next 
think worth remembering getting rid trump means lot things including making fill least one crucial supreme court seat potential filling two progressives playing defense this really last stand kind thing many us if get we'll losing decades progress 
unfortunately focusing defeating trump reactive proactive i'd like see talk solutions instead bigot must stopped costs and would minimum even get fifty senators ones vote never mind sixty that roadmap literally laid sanders prefer realistic discussions meantime 
you lay nicely issues biden but dont think much popularity average voter people actually vote to get sanders revolution going need young motivated en mass and doesnt seem happening sure better still around even depending state seems abysmally low matter look upside room improvement say friends so there's total if politically engaged go doubled turnout group though hard voting pushing result crowded democratic field only name recognition seemed solid chance lot pull sadly politicians arent convinced they're really bloc worth persuing 
fyi also want suggest political process country perfect we're struggling your primary system could well better 
biden wants improve repayment numbers years one friends posted facebook article someone crushing debt says bernie nominated might give vote trump so that's issue clearly better trump right no asked respond political posts it's like every one biden's policies they're either close bernie's even least supporters something but care fighting establishment 
not good enough sanders supporters they want work loans repaid tax payer 
it's worth noting apply private loans income based repayment currently pay taxes forgiven amount luckily biden wants change taxed part pslf right seem like long term solution i've read biden's plan see add year forgiveness years unfortunately situation interest rates grad school actually go far does still keep full well hopefully intends

sure agree makes sense nice thousands sanders supporters cheered this one worst episodes online harassment ever seen died 
if wanted coulda got gi bill oh well

north carolinian cal terrific candidate super guy he's still going need strong dem turnout win nov 
andrew yang twitter since started running always said would support democratic nominee the math clear joe biden glad endorse president knows serious fourth industrial revolution he spoken length 
and joe probably call yang first thing morning lol they every week apparently 
if joe wins yang sure cabinet member 
joe always respected yang's ideas hopefully get work together prepare country effects automation ai 
really hope he's vp think that's probably longshot it makes much sense head imo yang appeals progressives way biden younger base passionate online boost turnout among asians outsider etc meanwhile strengths older voters lots irl campaign infrastructure establishment candidate they seem perfect ticket balancing paradoxically share lot policy goals public option carbon taxes great personal relationship 
that true most yang gang board supporting bernie anger supporters pretending yanggang

are suggesting democrats living mississippi get say leads democratic party 
like virginia north carolina possibly texas they voted yet florida michigan pennsylvania important 
surprised there reason democrats struggle much solid guaranteed base plenty people would receptive message heard literally anyone republican it's combination voter suppression anemic local party little outside attention dems us 
well state east democratic senator west term governor keep hopes hate get mean honestly help enjoy maga snowflakes throwing constant slow motion meltdowns inability elect anyone connecticut they would probably gotten governorship payday loans guy trump clone bob stefanowski crowded primary actual candidates love shooting foot 
the perfect campaign shirt exi 
omg bought tweet less listen tee shirt yesterday cant afford all this 
rather like one https store joebiden com joe beto amy pete unisex black tee 
love message design meh pete joe needs work 
https www youtube com watch kugdkfu dw 
lol new swag gonna break 
yes i'm waiting see liz gets added 
and axe but tech editor cannot abide 
he can't stopped the joementum flowing veins 
whoever designing joe swag needs raise 
good we want lunatic far left right activists harm 
about time don't get wrong jill biden clutch defense can't all 
thank god jill symone body guards forever although amazing job say 
hope joe jill enjoyed last days civilians because november going secret service protection rest lives 
in future trump lite going request secret service protection ahead time appear presidential 
yeah sadly possibility sides possibly worse left establishment conspiracy stop boy think dangerous nonsense 
i'm certain one would break self isolation go human biological weapon touch biden even sneeze 
far left attack's rare right much common trump best make happen 
how lunatic corona virus has biden released test results https thehill com homenews campaign biden tested coronavirus says 
only took symone sanders getting knocked ipad make happen 
probably bill hillary always eagle evergreen 
your mouth god's ears feeling hopeful first time awhile 
unfortunately donald melania and barron years still joe cut protection without cutting obamas carters clintons bushes 
generally candidates consider big disadvantage lot harder talk people good conversations 
possibly worse left dude c'mon 
this galaxy brain take right wing violence rise much bigger problem right leftist even really exist us 
let's avoid even talking jest it takes one person power trip something like people want give anyone ideas 
unfortunately get bent shape donald lifetime secret service protection if loses election become persona non grata among republicans everyone else country he keep lives rest days increasing irrelevance plus access military secrets would rather kidnapped foreign nation rogue group former presidents even unpopular ones small price pay protect 
if anyone overcome disadvantage joe you tell sad makes chat close voters every speech due covid he loves talking people 
didn stop hillary talking voters incumbent president running office years past 
russia always literally controls world large degree the powerful man earth putin 
i'd appreciate sources statement like read 
other one communist shooter last year can't remember left wing terorists 
that fair point of course gives secrets willingly whole thing we probably revoke passport case 
either way best put idea people's heads it takes one person see think hey could fuck lot people pretty easily without accountability 
well italy declared anyone confirmed covid defies quarantine charged manslaughter so i'm somewhat certain us even retroactively would at least knowingly infected without malicious itentions suffer consequances barring exceptions 
holy shit after tuesday shows joe winning all remaining states we goin' white house boys 
too soon don't celebrate we're across finish line would expect lose wa id democrats abroad tomorrow we may even nd voters largely college students all close give bernie good press however mi mo substantially increase biden's delegate lead 
we close idaho washington if minutes today join team joe make clean sweep 
looked mi morning thought something broken site 
https www youtube com watch eaobn mm 
really like nate's model think easily misinterpreted handle impacts narratives unexpected results 
just time tennis court complete dr jill president biden doubles match michelle obama 
bernie keep feeding trump attack material convention that's pretty much going book tour pretending campaign hillary 
come didnt tesch us anything one vote time long way 
the predictions look good sanders even within margin error 
at point bernie strategy seems stay race hope chance joe either struck lightning attacked vegan 
it's selfevulent joe biden elected go know thing 
mean celebrate want perpetuate excitement joementum 
think biden wins nd heidi strong influence pure caucus year amy carried mn border counties even dropped she bernie 
generally curious would north dakota state whose economy practically centered around fracking vote bernie 
spent minutes text team yesterday i'm awaiting texting campaigns today 
i'm far ahead my wife budgeted giving money joe charities year sincerely believe benefit presidency way gutted donald trump 
reading article yesterday wa secretary state predicted final turnout bonkers primary only ballots returned friday evening still ton vote left cast received 
just moment realized jill going bad ass first lady she good people 
guess missed the young vote turning bernie joe expanded dem nice try though 
are making fun somebody's stutter is low fallen 
watched many vids prematurecelebration know declare winner till cross finish line everybody stay focus campaign like fate world depends 
think wa take days called missouri mississippi closing michigan might biden performs well he's expected id nd clue 
totally agree time need everyone know we're leading most people go vote someone loser path victory people get excited joe excited cast ballot state got part history think that's pretty cool 
at point narrow win either way really matter the sanders overtake biden winning big states like washington think clear happen whether wa gives net handful delegates likely blowing missouri mississippi racking delegate lead dozens 
absolutely right we get excited joe political forecasts showing lead great way but memories still haunt want repeat so let channel excitement action complacent take nothing granted edit think really page glass half empty person 
it's less delegates morale biden winning every single state tomorrow would crushing sanders campaign likely give boost needs win next tuesday 
totally agree on page i'm super curious michigan hunch always people vote bernie voted hillary 
agreed momentum important dominating biden looks easier primary go think lot people want quickly focus trump battling convention would massive distraction 
exactly want move trump primary turning bloodbath sanders 
senator kyrsten sinema endorses biden ahead arizona primary 
that makes current senator az future colleague mark kelly backing joe high hopes pete reference fall cking astronaut senate cool 
think joe going get lot arizona republican votes arizonans remember beloved senator john mccain gave one eulogies they would love trounce nasty rat occupying wh 
love sinema hope give new colleague year kelly both endorsed joe along pete's endorsement getting harder jump train 
hillary lost az fewer votes biden great chance 
this help primaries assume besides endorsement local outreach get vote 
it says something democrats purple areas endorse biden super safe blue ones sanders 
bill nelson served congress years and john glenn honestly think current probably first one long time astronaut senate 
this exactly https thehill com homenews campaign mcsally ties democratic rival kelly sanders new ad nominee important ballot races 
as former arizonan idea turning blue makes giddy love mccain though 
think biden well az one counterpoint bernie better latinos hispanics so going easy uncle joe millions last week around guess hopefully building infrastructure since 
god love she idol even live az family longtime visitor still seeing done phoenix metro area rest state 
forgot john glenn idea bill nelson astronaut just read jack garn training sitting senators go space well good bring one back 
mccain last republican serve senate maybe even elected office 
bernie seems targeting yuma nogales area forget phoenix metro still tons non latino democratic voters 
naaa he's trying claw back depths abyss though 
biden hold 'virtual' campaign events amid coronavirus outbreak 
really like idea also looks joe thought bernie 
love idea think campaigns stuff general especially people go rallies 
bring back fireside chats dammit 
reeeeally want bloomberg buy tv spots 
pete usual shows day talking virus needs make campaigns rethink definition campaigning means this likely reflection considering he's part campaign 
brilliant idea see 'ice cream hour joe biden' 
will new normal moving forward 
live youtube streams joe tend filled toxic bernard brothers trump supporters 
really appreciate biden shows cares safety staff voters it's going hard campaign pandemic hope everything goes alright health care important ever 
god he's looking sooo presidential recently think getting great coaching following surge i'm excited president biden 
i'm fucking west virginia you think anybody trump ever shows 
think something like needed americans regain trsut government 
sounds like something pete would think he staff lightyears ahead campaigns came digital 
attended virtual event pete campaign it nice 
most likely and trump keeps holding large rallies create stark contrast value american safety 
online events huge part beto's success impromptu online town halls surprisingly effective maintaining contact supporters answering questions providing level transparency authenticity that's hard come otherwise hope becomes trend democratic candidates 
hope future years go completely online it great way reach young people afford internet access lose older rural voters 
it need open comments curated question format would work perfectly town hall type deal joe needs focus policy anyways transitions general 
he also big holding conference calls supporters 
trump going struggle he loves ego stroked rallies all red hats cheering man lifeblood 
also speaking new ways campaign never forget beto livestreaming underwear folding never 
it's also great way make possible people disabilities may able deal long lines wait times lack sight etc feel part campaign 
do video screen shot haha 
fair point still cuts rural low income voters may little internet access 
think https www facebook com betoorourke videos folding laundry unless he's livestreamed multiple times brings whole new set questions edit welp drying et cetera know one part mainstream media got really fascinated fact owns boxer briefs

i'm working make coherent narrative good one warren endorsed yet know said i'd kamala first may shift characters around 
the large majority ca mail ballots cast day election 
bloomberg's jennifer epstein posited might test run similar hillary tim kaine's virginia rally primary https twitter com jeneps status 
naw think adds little value ticket but make great surrogate campaign 
tbh amy kamala pete endorsers also campaigning biden so look much one person point although like idea 
or ex candidates at rate biden four running mates 
well backup idea kamala valkyrie also pretty badass character 
he going get forest rangers west yellowstone 
shes aa adds lot value the vp doesnt need always swing state 
there definately better options vp 
spell check error my apologies certainly know meant your need point motivated exactly 
that actually exactly thinking one warren marvel 
biden problem black vote and take home state ca easily her base she make better ag running mate 
stacey abrams aa swing state also little baggage naturally charismatic presents good contrast biden 
know like geography depressed really everyone pushing vp 
awesome also attention gotta get senator senima congressman gallego 
this want bring fury other appease people makes zero sense vp it needs women blue wall state 
he doesnt would energize vote liken numbers she amy totally fine 
take black vote granted hillary better primary biden far lower expected turnout pa mi wi among many factors cost election 
hope brings loretta lynch back ag 
stacey win ga live ran good campaign yet swing state she made close going even without kemp's shady term sec state election it's better stays advocate getting people registered vote fighting disenfranchisement work black representatives focus flip senate seats first that's would not joe's potential vp sarah palin 
she unknown little exp swing state yes risk factor high wont mind aw well need vet 
push anything said enjoyed speeches attended buck buttercup it coalition 
amy seems make bit sense white ticket ideal people endorsement impact joe could really affect things midwest 
you realize stacey created organization called fair fight she responsible registering tens thousands people also made georgia competitive deep red many years would great pick vp much smarter intelligent sarah palin also top ticket lot help us win special compared low visibility work propose 
follow ga politics well know live my family generations we yet purple even dems hold dixiecrats i'd shocked dem governor go nom presidency could potentially years we're the concentrated atlanta gwinnett athens savannah those areas growing steadily need spread want actually make inroads stacey help joe campaign already black vote he obama ensure much progressives they generally either take liz everyone else endorses besides progressives field experience better images abrams in general looked sore loser never conceded election whether viewed right wrong across nation irrelevant electorate voted she flip rejected they'll suburban women union voters needs focus win key battlegrounds penn wisconsin florida michigan if he's smart he'll someone energize demographics even best candidate stacey's getting people registered pushing voting conditions work have advise get polls senate seats let run ground game that's she'll blue rnc trump spend money takes away states like pennsylvania that's order

big tent sorry i'm really idea 
absolutely getting trump that flipping senate important 
maybe obama energize crowds like saw midterms take senate keep house god hope the truth democrat able accomplish nearly much mitch mcconnell blocking things back democratic legislature even important takes presidency 
thought supported hillary pretty wholeheartedly general 
did miss something seen anyone attack there comments response coupe sanders supporters attacked switching gotten insulting 
bernie supporter said even still voting primary align platform ready willing support biden general gotten nothing love 
i'm sorry impression sub please report hateful comments mods we pride civil 
we welcome anyone comes good faith you find discussion concerns small real active subset sanders supporters engage cyberbullying trolling certainly understand like anything progressives fact us being moderate necessarily mean agree progressive goals believe best way achieve incremental progress rather trying everything anyways sorry got wrong idea sub 
what ever seen anything like supported sanders everyone welcome 
just one data point consider progressive establishment dna someone put voted warren primary i've love joe since senate i'm hoping progressives stay fight encourage nominee push agenda forward can't see comment referenced sorry gotten hostile treatment the mods good squashing really impressed also adopted pete's rules road this big tent party reason 
know tell it felt past couple days still would prefer ideals sanders overall turned lot stuff and say supporters anything makes people like movement ends mattering at least again really 
you comment appears contain substantial amount malarkey please advised generally consider acceptable limit parts per million 
hated trump supporters used line logic clinton people change decades think anyone ran hall wearing rainbow flag celebrate obergefell hodges opposing gay marriage time but i'll copy i've said elsewhere mean thing like bullied that's fact life we computers make decisions based entirely whims cold hard reality emotions so two people one agree things assholes warm likely go second this way message presented important and here's neither sanders many seem get that's devastating comes actually implementing plans let's assume majority house senate democrats say dems if four can't ground good compromising vision seems rest party fall behind work centrist democrats spent past year burning bridges much dying bullying others exact wrong accomplish anything spend months calling candidates snake rat drop expect completely ignoring tactics burnt ways moderates would need we're going anywhere keep driving away potential allies it's sanders' making misogynistic homophobic attacks right ago cannot see part revolution longer 
sanders actually opposed gay marriage biden lobbying obama support guys conveniently leave fact just like gloss candidate senate position arguably chance getting legislation passed years yet got nothing done and barely believed democratic system even vote could we dislike supporters mean actively tear harass candidates spread lies act non evil want people die gloating trying pack you see one communities self police talk way demeans opponents encourages sort vitriol gets directed us 
vote for my candidate or you're bigoted racist homophobic moron why is bernie losing 
biden one forced obama support gay marriage segregation talking point flat lie 
me seeing supporters different candidates come together twitter one wholesome things i've seen long time we really stronger 
because saw positives sanders nominees adopted best ideas clearly better candidates unity party importantly defeat trump 
would supported pretty much anyone hillary 
agreed without senate nothing get done mitch mcconnell even hold votes anything this problem focusing big policy promises ability expand electorate it matter president can't legislation passed especially someone calls socialist republicans gleefuly obstruct everything feel justified fighting takeover however would spin 
if want take senate one critical race montana after months urging steve bullock finally decided challenge daines he sitting term governor reelection day trump carried state points strong advocate getting dark money politics fighting climate change protecting obamacare keeping public lands hands worked across aisle bring real progressive building work predecessor brian schweitzer common sense values washington please consider donating campaign officially enters days 
you absolutely welcome seen anything like user describing 
they would lap switched bernie support man whose actions ideals encourage bullying others must corporate shill it's crazy write fluff pieces except hundreds sanders supporters posed pete try convince switch dropped lie get people candidate might something wrong 
there's difference senator president fear democracy world biden gets nomination he can't even keep track wife how's going handle mudslinging orange clown his record improve qol average joe abyssmal hope right beat trump doubt hold vicious attacks faux news he's inconsistent 
no joke kids campus like must rigged sanders losing buttigieg biden supporter took much willpower restrain telling outside echo chambers outright abusive campaigns dismissive narratives fit course people turned 
we really stronger together now that's phrase warms heart 
we saw integrity word candidates meant nothing endorsed biden stands change climate reform fixing anything 
it's like even posting politics sanders sub what motivation would lie joebiden for sweet karma got far oh well big deal some people want believe others there's nothing as long move one direction november i'll thrilled

understand congress would particularly board public healthcare easy electing candidate favour however find shocking american apprehensive system even something like obamacare 
you're right way approaching civil polite huge bernie supporter back hard see anything toxic inside the majority supporters good people everyone needs vote solidarity come november wish best 
most americans support obamacare even public healthcare option but many like ready trust government enough take control health care something go wrong especially early so think expanding reasonable path forward 
think mix fearing government controlling things obama care implemented public healthcare takes time cheaper better many jobs got rid could switch obamacare worse expensive 
one thing hear stated often private health insurance still allowed canada bernie plans eliminate make illegal how much healthcare think people would mind made sincere question

biden sweep super tuesday including kaine virginia only state sanders get vermont 
kaine good choice clinton think i've ever seen better running mate biden he complemented obama well decades experience federal government chaired senate foreign relations comitte could connect working class white voters way casual everyman persona compared obama's stoic professorial demeanor brilliant pick that election possibly significant vp picks tickets lord palin terrible undercut everything mccain knew lot democrats genuinely worried inexperienced president vps pretty much settled as jack cafferty said if john mccain wins woman one year old's heartbeat away united states hell 
sanders win california colorado without doubt unfortunately 
completely agree my hope biden picks someone like obama wins nomination people realize party open new blood future 
know someone considers republican can't stand trump he's voting biden primary 
that's sneaky way lining pelosi presidency i'm 
the rob reiner effect may help biden california widely respected film director endorsed year ago gets lot screen time real time bill maher news shows 
from understand vp obama could president limits technically elected 
do think arnold schwarzenegger might give endorsement 
obama would never he former constitutional law professor going try find loophole constitution allows potus the whole point amendment two limit presidency elected terms got third plus literally makes money giving single speech made year retire collect millions talking points rich bankers nothing better it pretty swell gig 
he republican endorsed john kasich 
he's probably bored though thinking might actually want vp ego would let 
he republican biden win republicans angle 
you full sh joe biden tells man accused actively trying end second amendment right 
hahahah go read comments politics desperate grosssssss ar lol lil oopsie 
the people putting pretending like going hurt must know absolutely nothing american politics 
watch trump bernie supporters try make next deplorable 
so new camp biden i'm starting get malarkey thing 
the guy full shit this idea democrats going send gestapo door confiscate guns like something cpac fever dream good biden making clear direct you cuts noise lot effectively nuanced argument founders actually meant 
as gun owner exchange solidly biden winning even though it'll look like loses he brought machine guns able one well you artillery just file appropriate paperwork pay fees etc how think big fun shoots those guys permits legally allowed things see government rarely takes away shit they make harder get more hoops this whole nra line democrats end america utter crap tbh done harm american demographic last years helped loathe local range bros women uncomfortable always something say politics responding enjoying membership paying russia dude want shoot used worst human garbage promote rights ownership they've someone hard i've gotta sit listen every liberal berate nuts never fucking member life voted republican federal election then fat pretending military talking chicks lesbians coming metaphorical cocks fml we need new permitting system training part everything else negotiable 
politics claiming told guy would slap because nbc article quotations listened video honestly seem saying am wrong did anyone else hear 
he probably thought betos endorsement 
can get people go trump way going biden 
this make people like america he surrounded group tough men talking guns stood ground anyone thinking lost mind edge needs see opposite reasons think 
while agree biden's sentiment think would criticized trump said 'you're full shit' someone disagreed although recognize difference honest disagreement misrepresenting position entirely president case presidential candidate calm face anger imo this really hurt biden though seen 'tell like is' moment primary no one remember general 
telling someone who's full shit good look saying slap bad fucking look c'mon joe keep mouth check man you see obama pulling 
as bernie supporter like think biden appeals average person when someone gets face falsely accuses order embarrass right thing call fuck dude 
the guy full shit count response agree kind talk actual policies but someone peddling false conspiracy theories deserve called this person clearly intent engage respectfully joe 
going able stand trump debate liked joe biden pumped right democratic president afraid call conservative lies fear mongering seriously think boost appeal people wants strong leader honest tells like 
this bad moment biden imo still support someone criticize needed 
mean seen bernie lecture crowd not sure bernie's base distraught 
as someone pro gun this reassuring definitely something using help sway friends away trump 
just donated another keep telling like joe 
pete biden supporter this really putting every time someone asks joe tough question challenges issue attacks insults 
love love gotta beat back lies mistruths world 
the fact guy understand joe point asking owned machine gun cringeworthy saying ar imo that great simple argument went right guys head 
how people think makes look bad hilarious especially crossover base suburban women 
planning voting warren still torn biden sanders i'm curious know solid supporters think repeat bad interactions voters agree guy full shit tells come back says work he also grabbed collar whole iq test push contest thing bizarre what's deal take 
anyone able find video saying would ban guns take away youtube search found videos owned shot gun supports common sense laws actually one parent magazine told person go buy double barrel shotgun needed home protection 
can someone explain support second amendment also supporting confiscation without due process or limiting firearm purchases one per month mandate owners either forfeit assault weapons register nfa literally entire purpose discourage tyrannical government doesn't giving list owns completely invalidate 
dont get guy full shit biden say 
joes one full shit an attack ar second amendment he going beto handle gun control issue blatantly said go door take guns how expect firearm enthusiast accept anyways opinion now left leaning people reddit ahead tell care dead kids 
someone tell rules road but lol 
studies show positive correlation amount cursing person honest 
my favorite thing biden exact opposite trump doesn result petty insults physical threats like rallies he incite violence instead hears people upset disagreeing that sign true leader perfectly contrasts represents oh wait sorry described bernie clearly resorts childish temper tantrums go tho 
he cant answer difficult question without personally attacking ppl what finger jabbing if hes nominee catch voting 
he shushed female aide threatened guy violence that react little questioning trump going destroy come november edit downvotes yet explanation defense this turn well sure 
biden bros like stable genius 
unsubscribe days ago also unsubscribed tyt youtube

george bush elected president twice he say nuclear find brazil map started two ground wars middle east 
auto workers delicate flowers positively faint presence crass language anyone thinks seriously hurt never worked hands life 
go bernie subs they're already 
if incident bad worse previous incidents please explain don't think terms right wrong you get real argument despite differences many democrats gun issue will vote joe wins nomination but messaging perspective it quotable sound bite condecension even directed person factory worker less we need win demographic group look trotted general election debates worst niether hillary romney ever threatened fight voter this another basket deplorables like baby plumber at least seems way 
people believed hrc kids basement pizza shop there really dumb voters 
this idea democrats going send gestapo door confiscate guns like something cpac fever dream what beto biden's new point man gun policy mean said hell yes he's coming take assumed that's proposed confiscation would work 
he'd full shit joe announced beto going charge gun control https www google com amp cnn politics beto orourke hell yes take ar ak index html that confiscation all guns see people care issue might much difference government coming rather if wanted frighten agitate announcement thing also yelling threatening slap convince calm they angry do math 
biden threatened take guy outside slap sticking finger dudes face told stop joe lost cool 
he said i'm going take ar what part require confiscation 
completely agree i'm sick nd amendment purity test really tests one must take part group country 
we need different word able run broadcast tv nominate feces 
i'm torn on one hand right decorum rising respect office etc he's talking familiar manner dont mean particular pejorative way thing job tbh im speaking ceo formal team subordinates wayyy casual anyway yea think still 
at point respectful the man raise voice clearly explained question concerns so previously seen incorrect it's candidates job clarify points answer questions instead joe rudely responded you're full shit gets aggressive guy asks finger pointed face if make mistake work think appropriate boss swear call 
show clip bernie threatens slap someone face disagreeing waiting have feeling tho 
mean hasnt threatened beat someone though joe literally pulled meet outside 
when trump behaves way opposers rallies donate he childish petty difference 
yeah i'm still behind joe but think good moment 
lol cant reason people he made right move 
yeah tell he's say something sets back goes wait starts why can't ignore 
hope wins real it good look 
calling prospective voter full shit threatening take outside whilst raising voice aggressively pointing yeah great stable leader look 
hilarious forget issues hand please explain any member office especially president right put voters face tell full shit and proceed threaten said voter violence am delusional seriously world rationalize 
honestly feel like calling sees after way majority country freakin idiotic whole trump debacle man patients idiots lol heck even felt listening workers phrase question done point completely empathize almost anger started speaking it blindly vote allow us wind someone whose legitimately dangerous seen stuff talking true probably good look biden better pretty blunt put bullshit maybe callous means getting back track undoing damage shit ton enabled presidency just thoughts what think edit realized much said idiot whoops and solid supporter liked warren but watching criticism unfold angering fucking joked assaulting women yr old girl got elected wtf tired hearing dumb none compares pulled sorry rant get chest right respect cutting political answer bullshitz 
listen gut look warren policies look bernie biden interactions voters trump opposers rallies do right thing 
https www youtube com watch uq vpgyrqy 
there maybe two supreme court cases regarding fairly limited restrictions government firearms the keep bear clause prohibit limiting firearm purchases limit weapons deprive anyone property without due process think confiscation would allowed sure mean specifically interested hearing discussing 
seeing guys defend guy behavior literally identical trumper antics the hypocrisy would quite hilarious painfully sad 
when cherrypick facts maybe it also describes biden though for example last night protestors rally detroit one threw ipad hit senior aide knocked and still yelling let stay like mins wanting hear say 
im tired let's get trump privilege picky little things 
bah recently discussion ar reason constantly saying corrected know time completely slipped mind 
the america gives enough shit biden got number wrong gun nuts voting gop anyways no one else cares 
what's ar googled rifle was supposed say 
he corrects later conversation it non story 
if gaffes come back bite ending like suuuuuuch easy slip 
if defense preferred candidate bush dumber maybe pick different person support also people say want 'fighter' think mean someone work hard deliver policy objectives somebody literally threatens to fight the voters 
can trumo find africa map 
people sick trump therefore want president resorts violent threats petty insults like 
literally used excuse trump supporters behavior dude 
pointing joe spent decades lying involvement desegregation 'shitty tactics' surely okay pissed question 
they care they're latching anything throw joe bernie always 'angry disgruntled' candidate that's baseline he wags finger people woman color conference last year kinda yells gets booed sc debate not forget yelling broad insinuations corruption candidates either 
effort post the comprehensive case joe biden 
this pinned cause sooo many people coming asking joe biden 
thanks reposting this one things actually got soften consider voting biden worth 
thank taking time write this incredible 
wow heart swells reading thank

as bernie voter considering voting november biden nominee appreciate think really washes weaknesses the bankruptcy bill huge red flag work consumer protection agencies actually hurting middle class families it's good there nothing say partisan usually experience nonpartisan sit examine second time decided moderates if wants beat trump want unsure i'll vote bc hes still going maintain bloated military budget results children around world dying may cut deals entitlements would horrify feel responsible voted needs things run obama's vp senator delaware his record questionable people change certainly but nevertheless ugly typical neoliberal many voters like saying bernies joes joe remember fondly changing foreign policy that's something even without congress strong message on fine wouldnt institute another iraq war again possible changed he must stop attacking young people progressives it makes look bad i'm sick dems win us pay lip service towards wise win suppress urge said write long paper end make decision seriousness gettable never moderate open idea getting unite country forgotten theres non democratic general election coming suppression issues need hands deck hes uniting base party registered african american women doesnt debate offputting kindly someone concerned i've always dem first might thinking despite loyal past that's sign i'd also add appeal larger audience dont leaves downvote away please ignore pretty fair balanced assessment whole 
the main thing disagree completely marijuana legalization his views stuck edit downvotes attempt explain biden might change still support voted bernie primary dem least give good reason proud 
biden seems like nice guy little goofy but make good candidate least sanders supporter does truly want help us my generation millennials so far really give chance trust tell pissed bad last years we need someone cares modern issues not another boomer offense older redditors guidance if bernie fails hope step provide hole that void economic future matter guys him understands two cents 
big hug last couple weeks warren mods 
think race really focused two issues that's progressive reformation getting celebrity playboy office understand sentiment wanting vote candidate believe biden nominee latter issue still relevant you could help get person rallies right wing extremists just cents it's also hard democratic voters bernie see supporters falling behind blue matter it may seem immature face value voting saying biden trump equally bad many others objectively false bernie first pick well forget big bad evil guy election we definitely need ranked system though
