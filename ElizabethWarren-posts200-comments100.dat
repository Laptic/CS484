Elizabeth Warren, Once a Front-Runner, Will Drop Out of Presidential Race
This is a sub for Elizabeth Warren supporters.  If you are not an Elizabeth Warren supporter, please do not come to this sub and particularly this thread to try to poach support.  Let us grieve in peace and decide in our own time who, if anyone, we will be supporting going forward.  There will be no tolerance for this.  If you are not a regular user on this sub and come here to convince people to support any other candidates, you will likely be banned.  This is your warning.  If anyone sees these comments, please report them for Promoting Other Candidates.  Thanks.
Ladies and Gentlemen,  its been an honor.  Liz will have a big role in cleaning up Washington corruption no matter who the Democratic nominee is.
Today is a sad day. Warren is amazing.
I salute you, Warren.  It was a damn honor fighting with you.
Ugh, my gut. Elizabeth is such an inspiration and her impact on this race will be felt for years to come. I'm looking forward to hearing from her and seeing what she does next. I've also been thinking about how great of a book she'll write about all this one day. I know there will be many of us still dreaming big and fighting hard alongside her.
Best candidate i've seen in my life.
Absolutely no shame in how it ended.  I am so **fucking proud** of Elizabeth.  No one can deny that she is the most qualified person to be President.   She fought with every ounce of strength she had and left the field with pride and dignity intact.  She is the President that America had always deserved.  I still believe in her. Always will be.
I dont regret my vote for her. I dont regret a cent donated to her campaign.   If she isnt a candidate for president again she should be an example for any future progressive running.
Mods, you‚Äôve done a great job with this sub.  Thank you!
Her trajectory from a college professor to a leader in policy for the Democratic party in 10 years has been awesome to watch and I know we will see more.
[Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a privilege](https://i.imgflip.com/3revv9.jpg)
She would have been an amazing President. I'm going to miss her candidacy and the incredible positive energy of this sub as well.
I‚Äôm sad. She would have made an excellent president.   The bright side is that she‚Äôll still keep kicking ass and taking names in the Senate, or wherever she might end up in the next administration.
I got in my little bit of yelling on r/politics, so I'll do the nicer bit here:  It's been incredible to see people from across the political spectrum be pulled together by Warren's campaign for the common good: for better healthcare for all, for a serious response to the climate crisis, for restitution and the lifting up of marginalized communities, and for the fundamental restructuring of the way we govern. I come from a conservative background, and Warren's path from apathetic Republican to progressive Democratic firebrand is part of what has shaped me into the political entity I am today. Seeing that this campaign has helped so many others with similar upbringings find the value in progressive ideas is what's given me hope after four terrible years.  I'm devastated that Warren won't be president. I stand by my belief that she is the perfect leader for this moment, even if enough voters haven't agreed. And I'm still hopeful, because Elizabeth Warren is not one to exit quietly when things don't go quite her way. Her loss against the 2005 bankruptcy bill spurred her to become one of the most beloved progressive politicians in a lifetime, and I imagine that this loss will also spur something greater. Warren is surrounded by brilliant people who can help carry her message ‚Äî Katie Porter and Ayanna Pressley, for example. I can't imagine that she won't capitalize on that to help bring about the big, structural change that we all believe in.  And I hope we all stick around to help her in that fight. Blood and teeth, and whatnot.
How privileged we are to exist at the same time in this vast history and universe as Elizabeth Warren.
Best presidential candidate in my lifetime. Things didn't line up all the way but I've never seen someone so committed not just to technical knowledge but also to understanding and pursuing equal justice for all people.   She's exactly the kind of person we need in a world that doesn't seen to have time for thoughtfulness or empathy.
Cried in my kitchen this morning making my little baby daughter breakfast. I truly believe Elizabeth Warren and her plans as president would have given her future the best possible chance.
The thing I'm still angry about is how she had a plan for everything that then got picked apart bit by bit. Meanwhile other (male) candidates don't have these detailed plans and they never get hammered for it.  Were those plans plans perfect? No, but she got a million times more attention than others. Imagine if a woman had said "what is Aleppo" they would have been made to resign the next day.  Edit: I'd like to take this moment to show you a great bit by 538: https://fivethirtyeight.com/audio-features/when-women-run/
She was the frontrunner for a few weeks until people asked her to explain how to pay for her plans, they didn‚Äôt like the answer. People ask Bernie the same question and he reiterates why we need the plan. I have a lot of respect for Warren for telling the truth.
Definitely saw this coming after Super Tuesday. But I was still rooting for her, when she stayed in for a bit. I was with her after Jay Inslee left because I felt like she could get stuff done against the rich and among other progressive ideals. Thank you Liz for being a voice for us regular folk.
As a woman in tech, Elizabeth's campaign has given voice to the war against misogyny all women must wage on a smaller scale every day. It‚Äôs been incredibly moving to watch her fight on a national stage, and heartbreaking to see it hamstring her. I‚Äôm so proud to support her, and I know that we will persist.
Let‚Äôs not lie here. She was the best candidate to sit in the Oval Office. The best.   Like if Americans actually choose the smart thoughtful savvy person to lead we would be so much better off, but no we have to have a bro you‚Äôd sit around your kitchen table with or a dad who tells you what to do.   In my entire lifetime I‚Äôve only ever seen Americans make the right choice for President once and I‚Äôm almost into my 40‚Äôs.
Was preparing for this, but it still hurts.  Thank you for all you've done, Elizabeth. Words cannot describe how much you've inspired me and how proud I am to have supported you.
Lots of ‚ÄúI love Warren, but...‚Äù comments on politics now.  Fuck that, I love Warren because she was the best candidate.  Great progressive, smart, well thought out plans, pragmatic, and has wit.    She doesn‚Äôt owe anyone an endorsement.  Do you, Liz.  ...also, give Bailey a nice pet.
This is a sad day, but plug for r/VoteBlue. Getting excited about taking back the Senate is making me more hopeful in the future. We have more progressives, and more of them vocal, now than we did in 2008. We can still positively impact the future!
I'm not going anywhere. This sub has been the best place to think about politics for me ever since r/politics turned into what it became.    I hope Warren is already thinking of her next steps. If Bernie can't complete what he set out to do, Warren can become the leader of the progressive movement. AOC is great, but still needs a few years to build political capital.
And America leaves another phenomenal female politician not only tragically underutilized, but also bullied and bloodied.
I understand why this had to happen and I'm so proud of her. I'm going to miss this sub. Hopefully we can stay open to give updates as to whatever work Elizabeth is doing in government at the moment? Obviously this is not the outcome we wanted, but Elizabeth Warren ran a real issues-oriented progressive campaign. I wish the American people can see that women are electable- IF YOU VOTE FOR THEM. In addition I'd like to thank all the callers/canvassers/employees/and volunteers for her campaign. You worked hard, and I'm also proud of you all. In time, I have a feeling the country will wish that we had selected her as our nominee. PERSIST.

I wish I could have done more for you Liz. I didn‚Äôt get on board until around December and I wish I had sooner. Damn it.  I wish you the best and loved everyone moment of your campaign.
[‚ÄúI might not be in this race anymore, but this fight goes on. I want you in this fight with me, we will *persist*‚Äù](https://twitter.com/alxthomp/status/1235599915016912896?s=21)   You heard her. Let‚Äôs keep on persisting Team Warren üíö.
This just goes on to show that when people ask "how are you going to pay for it?" they actually don't want an answer, just platitudes about how "the richest country should find a way" - which I agree with in theory, but laws don't get made on platitudes.  Liz's story is so inspirational - to go from a working class family in Oklahoma, to being a single mother whose goal was just to be a public school teacher, to a Harvard Law Professor who created CFPB out of thin air, and then become a United States Senator by running one of the most progressive campaigns of our time - is a story for the ages.  We lost the ability to nominate one of the smartest, most hard working policy geniuses, with a senate record to back it up because when Americans ask "how are you going to pay for it?" they actually don't want an answer.
I'm angry. And very sad.  Seeing America reject the most qualified Presidential candidate ever in Hillary had hurt quite a bit but I had hoped beyond hope that Warren would overcome in 2020. Turns out that glass ceiling with a million little cracks stays where it is. I'm mad. Mad at the old men who's hubris  kept it there.   But not mad enough to not want to get Trump tf out of office. I've cast my vote already on Super Tuesday so unfortunately I won't get to switch. But I'll be voting blue in November no matter what.  All I hope the rest of you do is the same and hammer down anyone who refuses to.  EDIT: I have also discovered r/voteblue which is for helping downballot Democrats. I'll moving the support I was giving Warren to downballot races exclusively.
Truly the candidate of my lifetime. This is totally devastating. Even though I was expecting the news and thought I was prepared, I‚Äôm sitting here typing this through tears.   Liz has inspired me and taught me so much, and every penny donated and hour spent volunteering was beyond worth it. Thanks to Liz I will never sit cynically on the sidelines ever again, no matter how difficult a fight looks.   And a big thank you to the mods and entire community here‚Äîyou‚Äôve been a bright spot, a safe space, and source of support amidst the condescension, derision, sexism, and fear that drives so much of our political narrative these days.   Feeling sad today, but also very grateful. When the dust settles, I know Liz will be out there fighting the good fight once again. And now she has us. :)
To the Bernie supporters trying to poach here, this is from another Bernie supporter, go the fuck home, they don‚Äôt want you here, any rational Bernie supporter doesn‚Äôt want you here. You‚Äôre not helping them, you‚Äôre not helping Bernie. I‚Äôm sorry for the trolls guys.
I knew it was coming but I‚Äôm still sad about it.  She‚Äôs a fantastic human being. I hope things go well for her in any of her future ambitions. As someone who plans to be a politician later in life she‚Äôs been a hero to me, I aspire to be someone who fights for the middle class like Warren has.
I‚Äôm pretty sad about this.
Damn that sucks. I went to Warren after Inslee dropped out for her aggressive and well thought out climate plan, as well as plans for seemingly everything else. I thought she was a great candidate and would have been a great POTUS. It sucked watching her slide in the polls after being a front runner. Still wish I had won that ‚Äúdrink a beer with Warren‚Äù fundraiser.
Ugh, I just feel demotivated. My state votes March 17th and both the candidates I love and I donated to are out. Neither Bernie or Biden inspire me or make me want to fight for them. I was hoping Warren would make it further but I understand why she is dropping.   I just feel like I don't have a horse in this race and I'm not confident either of the frontrunners can beat Trump. I'll be voting in November for whoever the nominee is but I have no idea who I'll vote for this primary.
This is disappointing to the extreme, of course. I think she would have been the best president. She is so smart and so empathetic.   It also honestly hurts because I felt a lot of misogyny with how everything shook out. In some respects, it was blatant. But also it was more subtle. Women have to be twice as good to get half the recognition. And of course I think after Hillary, people were afraid to back a woman again.   I can‚Äôt wait to see what she does next and I know she‚Äôll never stop fighting for everyday Americans.
I wish she could‚Äôve stayed in to the debate.  But she would‚Äôve seen her internal projections and being non viable in all the March 10 states would‚Äôve been a disaster.
I may have been idealistic thinking voters would choose pragmatism over populism or complacency, but I do not regret my support for Elizabeth Warren one bit.   Neither Bernie or Biden are great for unifying the party, let alone setting a tone for bringing the country forward and actually getting things accomplished successfully. But they are all Democrats have left.   Sometimes we get the politicians we deserve, not the ones we need. Maybe one day.
To the toxic misogynists on the far left trolling around, if not Warren then who?  Last time the answer was anyone but Hillary, "I would vote for a woman just not this one".  "I would vote for Warren in a heartbeat if she were running".   Well 2020 rolled around and now they're calling Warren of all people a corporatist shill in the pockets of wealthy donors.  If Warren, who cut her political teeth on taking on the banks wasn't good enough, then it's clear the purity test was really about purity of a certain gender and not about policy or ideas.  Anyway I'm proud of the campaign she ran.  Policy driven with realistic ideas for how to implement progressive policies instead of "we'll give everyone a pony because the government can afford it".  I'm still hoping she plays a large role in shaping our collective futures, because we'll all be better off with her in the fight.
Thank you for running Senator Warren. I guess America is not ready for a president who actually has plans instead of platitudes.
Knew it Was coming doesn't make me any less sad.
I‚Äôm happy to say that I‚Äôm not going to give a shit about anything regarding the race until November. Already voted for her in my state, my civil duty is done. I‚Äôm going to r/VoteBlue for anything regarding dems this point forward. Whoever wins the nominee, I‚Äôll be canvassing for since I‚Äôm genuinely just not a fan of either candidate.
I worked harder to volunteer for Warren‚Äôs campaign than I ever have for another candidate. It was an honor and I‚Äôll be inspired by her forever. It‚Äôs people like her that make me believe in politics.

I know what it‚Äôs like to see sexism play a part in your preferred candidate‚Äôs campaign. I saw it as a Hillary voter and I saw it as a Kamala voter (with a dash of racism). I didn‚Äôt agree with Warren on things, but I appreciate the fact that she was the one to at least try to do the homework.  I won‚Äôt tell you guys who to vote for, but I hope you take note on which campaigns that were toxic, the ones that align with you most along with the ones who‚Äôve treated you with respect.  Whoever that may be, let‚Äôs get 45 out in November.
Unlike when I supported HC and cried on election eve because I supported only by voting, I went all out for Warren so my regret is not personal. I did everything I could, donating, volunteering, lending my social media presence to our movement and talking to friends and family.  I am angry that the democratic base have bought into white male privilege so much so that we decided on our own be to sexist lazy motherfuckers.  Instead of fighting for what we believe in, we chose the perceived road with least resistance
It's been an honor supporting Warren from overseas. I came to support Warren as a progressive economic policy geek who very much admired her work and advocacy on bankruptcy law and financial consumer protection, and loved her policy-based approach and progressive policy proposals which were broaching the exact topics and problems I was worried about as well.   To be honest most of the other various candidates and politicians I have supported and campaigned for in the past were white males. Observing the debate and the treatment of Warren by media, pundits and her opponents (certainly the supporters of a certain candidate)  has given me a greater appreciation of the deep-rooted problem of misogyny in politics.   I never supported Warren because she was a woman and as a white heterosexual rather middle-class man I have always kept my distance from gender issues but I walk away from the campaign with the conviction that we need more women in politics and we need to change the way we talk about women candidates.   Still I hope to be part of the fight to have her different plans and policy proposals become reality. Her policy-based approach might not have paid out in her case but I take inspiration from it. Big thank you to this subreddit which has always had a friendly, welcoming and positive atmosphere. A very big thank you to the mod team who have made that possible and I know have had to spent lot's of time dealing with the different reports. You have done an awesome job.  Proud to call myself a Warren Democrat. #WePersist.
Hey guys, former Mayor Pete supporter here. I know how painful this moment can be. I'm so happy Elizabeth Warren ran for President, and I'm sad she didn't end up as our nominee. She's a patriot who has fought to make America work better for everyone. I can't wait to see what she continues to achieve in the future.
And now we're down to my #8 and #9 choices. Go #8, I guess!
The greatest President that never was. I'm still in the fight with Liz, I'll just have to find another way now.
I'm glad to see that she is not currently planning on endorsing anyone. I don't think her endorsement would move the needle for anyone enough to justify all the backlash she'd receive.
Well, damn.  I'm not giving anymore money to anyone this campaign season. I think my money might be poisonous.  I've literally donated to Kamala, Pete, Buttigieg, and Yang....   I also donated to Michael Muscato and Mark Kelly... Noooooooooooooo!
[removed]
:(
I hope she will still be in good health in 2024!
Liz was so valuable to this race. She eviscerated Bloomberg. She protected the whole party from the lure of selling out our integrity.
Just saw Juli√°n Castro's lovely tweet. This has to be a tough day for him as well.
Now let's work our asses off to flip the Senate so we can get Senate Majority Leader Warren.
It's been a ride guys. A frustrating one at times, and it's hard to see this day finally arrive. But I'm glad I got to fight with her.   And maybe one day this sub will get the chance to fight for her again.
So proud of her campaign and the energy that she brought to this race. I have never felt so excited by a candidate before, and I'm excited to know she will still be an incredibly strong leader in this country for years to come. Thanks for everything, Liz, I can't wait to continue supporting you in everything that you do.
This is not the news I needed on a Thursday morning.  Anyways what a campaign we dreamed about and fought hard for. We started off in this crowded primary in the back of the field and eventually against the likes of Inslee, Beto, Gillibrand, Harris, Booker and Klobuchar, we lasted the longest. We placed third in this primary that started off with 20+ people. At one point even we damn well led the race and looked like we were going to win the whole thing!   While the Super Tuesday results are not any of us expected nor wanted, its important to remember Warren‚Äôs ideology and her extremely long list of plans. We might be moving to other candidates but remember about Warren‚Äôs plans, let‚Äôs work with her to get her ex-opponents to adopt them.   Joe Biden is an outstanding man who has dedicated his life to public service. He has the tremendous experience, knowledge and virtue needed to be a great president. I will have no issue supporting him in the general.  However Joe Biden will not be the candidate I support for the remainder of this primary. While Warren may or may not endorse anyone, I personally endorse Bernie for the remainder of this race. While we have an ill relationship with some of his supporters, Bernie himself represents Warren and my ideological counterpart. He is far more anti-corruption, anti-wall street then Biden. Just like our candidate does, Bernie supporters Medicare for all among other platforms similar to Warren that starts to erode the largest amount of income inequality in our country since the Gilded Age.   Lastly it‚Äôs been amazing following the race with all of you. What a great community we had here. I like to think Elizabeth Warren was our inspiration in being respectful and researching our platforms and positions we take as her supporters. I am so fortunate she is my senator.  Nevertheless she persisted.
Farewell, Senator Warren. You were my first choice all the way through.
I didn‚Äôt like politics. I thought all the people with yard signs and bumper stickers were idiots. What happens if your candidate loses?  I voted for the first time in 2016. I was finally not in school and at a permanent address. I desperately wanted Warren to run then, but because she never did, I voted Sanders. Sanders didn‚Äôt get the nomination. I didn‚Äôt think Clinton would lose and I disliked her and her supporters calling me sexist for not liking her. I could not vote for Trump, so I voted third party.  Now in 2020, my ideal candidate has decided to run. Whereas in 2016, I thought political contributions were moronic, I donated as much as my budget allowed in at the end 2018. Even though I may have disagreed on some things with fellow Warren voters, I now know how it feels to be passionate about a candidate.  I hate how I have to compromise and vote for Sanders again. We had a chance at not just the best candidate but what I saw as the perfect candidate.  I now know why people would sticker their cars and buy merch. Even though it‚Äôs over, I am very tempted to purchase a sweatshirt or a tshirt to show that I was in this fight. I don‚Äôt know.  We had a chance.
By the way, I'm taking the donation I was going to make to Elizabeth this month and giving it to Ayanna Pressley's campaign as a thank you. She was so powerful and motivating and she worked her heart out for Liz.
Should have been Warren. Period.
I'm still drinking out of my Billionaires Tears coffee mug for the rest of my life.
Elizabeth Warren, "Slayer of Dragons" and the very definition of "True Grit"; this country may not deserve you, but it needs you, in whatever role you choose to play.  I will always have your back.  It's been a honor and a privilege to call myself an Elizabeth Warren supporter and to watch you fight for us and for justice for everyone.
I‚Äôm so sad üò≠
Warren ran a good campaign! Gave $5 to the national women law center in her honor. Can provide proof if you want. I‚Äôm sorry guys.
I'm just so disappointed she didnt do better. She is what we need.
Well I was already pretty grumpy pants because I was a hardcore Booker supporter, with Warren in second. So it felt like I was sitting in a corner this whole time watching the "adults" argue about silly things. Sigh....  &#x200B;  I'm hoping that if a Dem gets the presidency it will only be one term, and then we can get some much needed new blood into this thing.
I hope this sub stays active as we continue to follow the AMAZING Elizabeth Warren, to see where she leads this country in reform. Policy proposals, senate votes, interviews, campaign trail work...  I love the community we built here. Let‚Äôs keep it going!!
My heart hurts. She really was the best candidate.
I just got my Warren sticker in the mail last night, which was such a bittersweet moment considering how much has happened since I ordered it :( But anyways, it‚Äôs been an amazing past few months on this sub with you folks, and and even more amazing time fighting alongside Liz.   I was lucky enough to cast my proudest vote ever for Elizabeth Warren last week. I suppose I‚Äôm in the Bernie camp now, but idk what form that will take and I‚Äôll probably take a break from Reddit for a little while after this week. The fight for a Green New Deal, M4A, ending corruption, and all progressive policies, goes on.   LFG. Love you all.
Warren was amazing, it breaks my heart that smart, capable and experienced women have such a steep uphill climb in American politics.  She was by far the best choice, and possibly the only unity candidate left.
I still don‚Äôt get it but that‚Äôs life. I‚Äôll never regret voting for Elizabeth and I will tell this story next election and the next after that.   What an incredible woman. Heartbroken, but proud.
Senator Warren taught me that as a woman you can aspire to be anything you want. She also taught me that as a woman you can be the best qualified and work the hardest and still not make it. Both of these are lessons I am glad I learned in life. Thank you senator, for being the first campaign I volunteered for, donated to and believed in. Heartbroken today and will keep persisting tomorrow.
I'm absolutely devastated, and my heart is breaking for what Elizabeth must be going through.   This community has been amazing for those of us getting harrassed everywhere else. Thank you, mods, and all of you for the support and encouragement!
I am having a hard time accepting that we are not gonna have Elizabeth Warren as our next President. This timeline sucks.
Finally opping in after doing emotional triage with several fellow Warren supporters today:  Hey y'all? We are allowed to be sad. We are allowed to be angry. We are allowed to be unbearably upset that *yet another* accomplished, competent, eloquent woman has been pushed out of the race in favor of two 80-year-old mediocre white men with mixed records that should have passed the torch long ago. And we are allowed to express those feelings without the condescending "so you voted for her because she's a woman?" discussion happening. Call that out when you see it, because it's just as much nonsense now as it's ever been.  Regardless of how I feel about them individually or as candidates, Kirsten Gillibrand deserved better. Kamala Harris deserved better. Amy Klobuchar deserved better. And goddammit, Elizabeth Warren deserved *so* much better than she got. And that's the truth on that.
Loved Elizabeth with all my heart. She really made me think she was the only person to do the job for the people, and make this country work for everyone. But remember, we need to support the Democratic nominee regardless of who it is. There‚Äôs too much at stake. 2 SCOTUS seats could change our country for decades. And the Democratic cabinet will be so qualified, think of all the amazing candidates we‚Äôve seen in the last year. Take a minute to be upset, but Liz will keep fighting for us in whatever role she has.
We knew it was coming like Liz we understand Math. Disappointed that i never got to actually vote for her. I guess maybe she'll still be on the ballot in 5 days so i probably will.   Proud supporter forever, it was an honor to be a volunteer and actually be part of something important, helping her fight was a very positive and rewarding experience.   Now our mission is clear.   And in 2024? who knows right?
Well, that‚Äôs it. Good season everybody....see you in ‚Äò24?
Oh Liz.... ): Thank you for fighting the good fight. We didn't deserve youüíî
It has been a privilege supporting the best candidate I have ever seen. I let myself hope that we could do better this time around. I was wrong, but do not regret letting myself fully believe in her and have hope for that brief window of time. I'm so glad I got to attend her town hall in VA and be fully inspired by something political instead of ashamed or frustrated.   I am sad for our broken country today but we have to keep going. I know she will be campaigning for whoever the nominee is and I hope that person gives her a large voice in their administration.
I'm so so sad. Thank you so much to everyone who worked so hard to volunteer, donate and do their best in this campaign. Thank you Elizabeth Warren for running a great campaign and for promoting thoughtful, planned out progressivism. I feel extremely privileged to have been able to vote for her in this primary, someone I genuinely believe could have done some amazing things with her presidency.   Let's keep persisting in the general.
I'm gonna live in denial until she issues her own statement.   DEBATE ON THE 15TH GUYS, RIGHT?
This really hurts like she had so many detailed plans for how to help improve our country. Meanwhile most of the other candidates where just shitting out slogans .  She was blocked out by the media . Constantly attacked over every little thing . If half the people who said they liked her ,but " she isn't electable" actually voted for her we wouldn't be in this mess . Fuck I just can't .
Best candidate ever. By far the most accomplished and intelligent candidate and someone always empathetic, enthusiastic, and willing to listen.   I‚Äôm so frustrated that America couldn‚Äôt see a near perfect candidate right in front of them. I‚Äôm so saddened by all the hate she has gotten throughout her entire campaign after dedicating her life to improving this country. But I‚Äôm so happy to have been a part of this campaign and for once feel passionately about a presidential candidate.  Thank you Liz! Hope to see you again in 2024
Liz, I am so sorry we couldn‚Äôt yet again choose the best fucking candidate available. We‚Äôll continue to deal in mediocrity I guess. You were noticed and as a woman I appreciate the bravery you exhibited in actually running and putting forth your vision, which isn‚Äôt just great and shared, but the actual best available.
I love you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è  I am so grateful that I could be part of this with Liz. I really really hope we see more of her in 2024.
I think it's pretty clear she would have made the best president in this field. Shame the US wasn't ready for her. Can't wait until that glass ceiling is broken so we elect the best candidate, regardless of their gender.
This is so incredibly depressing.
Ugh. This was a gut punch. Elizabeth was the best of the best. I'm incredibly sad this happened. Warren inspired me and I'll keep fighting for her vision of a more equitable, accountable America.
Very proud of the campaign Warren ran. So happy that she pulled no punches and obliterated Bloomberg.
Warren was the candidate we needed, but clearly not the one we deserve. This is a sad day for the Democratic party and for America.  It's been an honor to meet so many of you, text, donate and enjoy my time with one of the greatest groups of people I've ever been a part of.  Thank you so much for everything you guys have done, and never stop fighting. Never.
AOC: "Warren was not mean, nor angry. She was effective. And by the way, we are allowed to be angry about racial profiling. You‚Äôre allowed to be angry about sexual harassment. Or at big banks committing fraud against single parents. Anger at injustice is quite appropriate."
I always appreciate it when AOC works to promote progressive wing unity and mutual respect üôå
This is cool. Even though she endorsed Bernie I appreciate that she‚Äôs not Bernie or bust and is really smart about trying to make the progressive tent bigger, not smaller.  I like Hillary Clinton, and early on I watched a series of interviews with AOC (maybe from vice?). The interviewer kept saying anti-Hillary stuff, and AOC was not piling on. She very carefully steered away from it, and I was super impressed by that.  Bernie is super lucky to have her in her camp, but I‚Äôll take this nod to Warren!
I've had my issues with Bernie Sanders, but never for one second with AOC. She's able to push the conversation leftward but pragmatically and reasonably and inclusively.
Jennifer Rubin is so awful. I often find myself wondering how these mediocre white people get these cushy jobs at large newspapers spewing out their shitty hot takes as ‚Äúexpert opinions.‚Äù
It's so refreshing to hear AOC talk... It's so weird to hear an elected official not talk complete bullshit all the time.
Pramila Jayapal also tweeted something similar last night. Good to see the progressive wing is finally in agreement about something!
The time is 2020 to make history with Elizabeth Warren as the 1st woman POTUS.
AOC is the future!!!
I just came here to say this:  I have fallen in love with Liz Warren again last night. That opening against the Bloom was just a masterpiece. honestly respect!  Loved her since I first heard her speak on I think it was Jon Stewart, felt hurt a bit (sry Sandes man here) but this was just wow.
AOC just annoys me. Guess it‚Äôs a good endorsement though
AOC is arguably a major factor Bernie is doing well. After his heart attack in October, AOC endorsed and actively started campaigning with Bernie.
Warren was a straight up beast last night. It‚Äôs nice to see her fired up. I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter, but goddamn was it amazing to see someone on the stage just cut to the heart of the issue and call a spade a spade. Bloomberg, mayor pete, Klobuchar and Biden have no business on that stage. This race should be between Bernie and warren and it‚Äôd be amazing if they were on the same ticket at the end of the line.   Keep fighting the good fight ladies and gents. Real change to our insanely unbalanced system is in sight.
I‚Äôm looking forward to AOC running for president.
I'm not American. What would AOC's political career look like? Congresswoman for a few years and the on to the Senate?
I'm sure supporters of the other candidate are giving her a hard time for tweeting this, she deserves better.  Also, if she ever considers switching side, I'm all for it. üòõ
I hate her politics but Warren is not mean or angry she is a strong passionate leader. She is the best chance against Trump and Dems not backing her idk what you are doing tbh. Shes a killer that goes for the throat every time. A strong and decisive leader like that is something even Republicans will respect her for.
Aoc will be the bridge that brings the progressives together. It is the way.

Bernie supporter, but I‚Äôve also loved her this whole time. If my horse doesn‚Äôt make it past the line she‚Äôs the only other candidate I can back with any kind of moral fortitude.
Sounds like something emperor palpitine would say ngl
AOC is so inspiring.
Whether we support Warren or Sanders in the primary, we‚Äôre all future AOC voters. We need her to lead the charge of the next generation of progressives!
Really wished AOC had backed Warren, but this is nice to see.
Bernie supporter. I donated to Warren yesterday after that debate performance. I think she may very well have saved the Democratic party by destroying Bloombergs campaign. She has always been my #2 but I got chills watching her press Bloomberg. Her criticism of his 'apology' for stop and frisk was perfect. Would not be disappointed with her in the WH. Ok I'd be a teeny bit disappointed my boy Bernie didn't get it but I'd be happy a progressive fighter won.
DOUBLE NEGATIVE
Damn. I'm from Ohio, and have my mail-in ballot in my hand. I really thought this was going to be the year my vote would matter. Glad I didn't mark it yesterday.
It's a good statement on "fragility."  It is moderate and healthy to call a racist a racist, and a sexist a sexist.
I honestly am not a fan of the anger is justified take.  I'm not at all saying people can't be upset.  I am saying pretending that anger should be work with pride and wielded as a weapon leads to people being easily manipulated and pure zealotry.  It also undermines people who don't wear their anger on their sleeve as ' simply not caring enough' which is simply untrue.  Nothing against AOC. It concerns me when anyone does it.
Warren should have Yelled loudly, turned Red faced and flail her arms around while screaming "Whatabout the people trolling my campaign staff?"
[removed]
I saw her interview yesterday on The View. Thought she handled herself extremely well and I‚Äôm always amazed at her ability to communicate progressive values and be a ‚Äúhappy warrior.‚Äù  Once Warren gets the nomination (üòâ)she will be a fantastic advocate when it comes time to win over Sanders voters.
AOC is Bernies best surrogate, the best for unity of the progressive wing , I really hope the best for her
>progressive wing unity   Shouldn't it be more important to have *democratic* unity? Not just one wing?  Because AOC sure does go after fellow democrats quite a bit, even if this one time she defended Warren.
I think that's because, at the end of the day, she's a Democrat. She might disagree with more centrist or center-left Dems, and identify as a democratic socialist, but AOC is an actual member of the party.
I wish some of Bernie‚Äôs other surrogates were as good as AOC is here. One of my biggest issues with Bernie is he has some real grifters as surrogates that I wish he would cut loose.
Same here. I feel like AOC is my holy grail president down the line. Or even not, she's just an amazing treasure to have in congress.
AOC was the shot in the arm Sanders needed to reinvigorate his campaign. She's such a great organizer.
It's impressive how effortlessly good she is at this
What are your issues with Bernie?
The thing about Rubin is that she has no long-term experience with Democratic voters or our priorities. She tears down our progressive wing while building up the moderates because she wants to vote for a Democrat that she's comfortable with, period. That's true of most of the never-Trumpers.
THANK YOU. This. I wondered the exact same thing.
As a mediocre white person I also would like a cushy job.
These news organizations all want to have their token conservative.
Yet another Never Trump Republican trying to reshape our party instead of reflecting on how their own party became so abhorrent in the first place.
Rubin is anti-Trump and that's all she's good for.  The minute a Democratic President is sworn in, she'll go back to her liberal bashing nature and won't touch a GOP politician again, she's just smart enough to realize that hating on Trump right now gives her WaPo column eyeballs when before it wasn't.
Because there are so few Republicans left who haven't completely lost their faculties and publications are desperate to display "diversity in voices", so disingenuous hacks like Rubin get kept on the payroll.  Her "hot take" was that Buttigieg was the clear winner last night (spoiler: that's been her take this entire time and has praised him multiple times). Honestly, if I were a Buttigieg supporter one of my main concerns would be wondering why Republicans repeatedly push him as the best candidate.   Her shot at Warren's justified take-down of people last night was pathetic and openly sexist.
She has been peddling this crap for ages. Only worth ignoring and occasionally dunking on.
I told people not to trust her when she was praising Warren. She's the slimiest of snakes.
I love her, and really hope she runs for the presidency in 2028 -- after 8 years of President Warren, of course!
Well said!
The progressive wing (and supporters) champions progressives who show their fire and fight for what. Warren did that last night - something she hasn't done in a very long time to the same degree (not since Occupy imo).  This is why the Bernie supporters are drawn to Bernie - his fire and passion that makes you believe he means what he says. Warren did the same last night.
>1st woman POTUS.  so long overdue and her being the first would be something for the history-books!
I mean, I'd say that the rest of the candidates, excluding Bloomberg represent the Democratic party in various ways. They may not be the *future* of the party, but I think that they belong there.  I just hope they lose.
>Warren was a straight up beast last night.  More pls!  That start was just glorious!
She has the ability to go in any number of directions moving forwards. She could likely stay a representative for quite some time if she so chose, but if she has her sights set higher (i.e. if she saw herself running for president someday) then a position in the Senate would generally be considered a step upwards career-wise.   However, to do so she would need to wait for one of the two current New York Democratic senator to retire or primary them (to take their seat from them). The latter would probably be controversial, but she did get her current seat from kicking a long-time incumbent Democrat out, so who knows?
Removed. Please don‚Äôt use that phrase to refer to Bernie supporters. It‚Äôs just unnecessarily divisive. Feel free to edit your comment, reply to this, and I‚Äôll reapprove it. Thanks.
Fuck this. I've been on the Bernie bandwagon since 2015 and I love AOC. What Bernie supporter doesn't like AOC? I thought those two things went together like chocolate and peanut butter.  She's endorsed Bernie for fucks sake.
Bernie bro here. I commend Warren for last night's debate performance, and I also appreciate the way AOC speaks. AOC is easily one of my favorite politicians, with her grassroots campaign and her work on the committees she sits on. She is incredible.  I think the Bernie bro narrative is out of control. I might speak out against your opinion because my opinion is different, but I won't be rude about it. I'll just show you why I think in such a way. There might be a loud minority of people who get angry because a lot of individuals are misrepresenting what Senator Sanders stands for, and the reasons he stands for an issue. It's going to happen when you have the most diverse coalition of people.
[deleted]
I agree with your point that anger is weaponizable and not intrinsically positive -- and that politicians shouldn't have to regularly exude anger to avoid being accused of being "complacent" or whatever.  **I would point out that in this tweet AOC does say that we** ***are allowed to be*** **angry, not that we** ***should*** **or** ***must*** **be angry, which I think is an important distinction for everyone to keep in mind.**
I think part of it comes down to the different ways men and women's anger are treated by our society. Men are encouraged to be angry and aggressive all the time and are punished for showing any other feelings, whereas women are punished for showing even the slightest bit of anger.   Neither of these extremes are healthy. All humans, regardless of their gender, should be allowed to feel and express anger, but not to a destructive, fanatical degree.
I didn't get that impression from AOC's tweet. Like, at all.  She was saying genuine anger about real, impactful issues is an understandable reaction. It was a response to a very reductive and insulting comment from Rubin. She wasn't dismissing "speak softly, carry a big stick" or commanding people to get angry.  I do agree that OTT, performative anger is often unhelpful, if not counterproductive. But, I don't believe AOC was really promoting that concept.
I really hope Bernie reads your comments. His angry rehtoric is very concerning and divisive.
This is not a Republican talking point. She's highlighting the difference between their funding plans. Please don't try this disinformation BS
Sanders voter here. You don‚Äôt have to win me over. If Warren wins the nomination, voting for her over Trump (or anyone else save Bloomberg) is a no-brainer.
I don't think you need to win over the Sanders voters. I'm Sanders 1 Warren 2, then a bunch of equally unexciting, but better than Trump people. And the Gap between Warren and the others is huge.
Hell I‚Äôd be over on warrens side if she surges in the polls and seems the most likely to win. The whole reason I‚Äôm a sanders supporter is mostly due to his polling at present. I don‚Äôt want to risk a centrist nominee. Let‚Äôs see what happens in the next couple races.
Sigh. I'm so longing for ranked choice voting. While Warren is my #1, I get the feeling she is a LOT of people's #2s. Again, part of her push for unity while staying the progressive course.
Either is fine with me. They both seem like intelligent people who want to make life better for regular people.
I hate that the reality is that Sanders voters will have to be "won over."
Don‚Äôt worry, as a sanders voter I will vote for warren without hesitation if she gets the nom
Sanders supporter here, but I come in peace. Why do you think Warren will get the nomination over Sanders?
As many have already said, she won‚Äôt need to win over Sanders voters. Let‚Äôs not forget that something like 80% of Sanders voters voted for Hillary in 2016. Warren is an even easier sell to all of us.
She dropped
Warren last night being pro-superdelegates at the convention polarized all of the Bernie supporters I know even further - Warren is doing herself no favors by making such statements and constantly defending/allying with Klobuchar over Sanders  &#x200B;  The perpetual dig at Sanders voters is also a questionable 'unity' approach given that she is going to need Sanders supporters to win the nomination..
[removed]
Most Sanders voters would gladly vote for Warren if she was leading in delegates. It's basically every other candidate that a lot of them would say "or bust" to.
>Once Warren gets the nomination (üòâ)she will be a fantastic advocate when it comes time to win over Sanders voters.  Sanders voter here.   I held my nose and voted for Hillary. I listened to all of the more moderate people - like you guys - and did what was "best for the country" even after Clinton and her cronies stole the primary from the most popular candidate with the best chance to defeat Trump.   I'm not voting for any Democrat other than Sanders, and I won't vote for another Democrat in my life if they steal this nomination from him. I'm not alone.   If you want Trump to lose, you either get behind the right guy or fight that battle alone.
> Because AOC sure does go after fellow democrats quite a bit  As she should. As she says in her tweet, anger at injustice is appropriate   She's never "gone after democrats" based on their personality, looks, race, gender etc. etc. She has called them out on *policy*, as she should, as we all should.
Yeah. Team player. I dig it.
Exactly. I've seen some Bernie people wonder why a lot of more mainstream Dems like AOC but not Bernie and a large part of her appeal is that she's proud to be a Democrat and is working to improve the party.
His press secretary compared asking for his health records to *birtherism*. His campaign is full of people like that.
Same. One of the big reasons I prefer Warren is the high quality of her surrogates. Shows good judgment, and I think she would build an amazing cabinet.
[removed]
I can't wait to canvas for Presidential nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She's like if Sanders and Warren did the fusion dance from Dragon Ball Z.
I genuinely feel that wouldn't be a good idea any time soon and I love AOC. But I think she's more valuable as a GOP boogieman in congress. Maybe senate down the road, but for now just stay in the house. She has a TON of power right where she's at. She's shifting the HELL out of the overton window. I'd rather she be a Ted Kennedy than a Barack Obama.
This is absolutely true, and I admit I was gutted when she first announced she was joining Bernie's team for this reason haha. I wanted her with Warren. Either way she is a fighter for progressive values and we are #blessed to have her.
AOC deserves credit for keeping Bernie's campaign afloat after his heart attack. Huge endorsement at exactly the right time.
Her success is the opposite of effortless
I think he's a great communicator and is the only person in my lifetime to really really substantially move the Overton window leftward, but I think he'd be an awful president. He's the perfect outside agitator to move the power in the right direction, not as the center of power himself. I could get more into it.
This has always been an annoyance of mine with Never Trumpers. They like to say that the Democratic Party needs to move to the center to beat Trump because they are thinking of what **they** want to vote for. The problem is there aren‚Äôt enough Never Trumpers to make a difference.   Most conservatives will vote for Trump regardless of which Democrat wins the nomination. They seem to think there‚Äôs a massive army of conservatives out there who don‚Äôt like Trump and are looking for a moderate Democrat to vote for. I don‚Äôt see it.
I think literally anybody but Trump would still have people like Rubin on their side.
Because a moderate democrat worked so well in 2016.  2004.  2000.
Yeah.  You helped to fuck up the republican party.  Maybe you aren't the best person to come up with the solution to the Democratic party?
snake talk don't help no one
My personal dream is 8 years of Warren, then 8 years of Castro then 8 years of AOC. It‚Äôs a pipe dream but it‚Äôs my pipe dream and I‚Äôm sticking to it!
Yea that would be awesome.  100% honesty: I want 8 years of Sander/Warren and AOC 2028 to continue the New new deal.  Remember the 2 term limit was put in place because off FDR being so enormously popular with the New Deal and yea war-time pres is a great plus too, especially if u won against the f\*\*\*\*ng nazis, but yea.
That‚Äôs fair. I think Pete, Klobuchar, and Biden are all kind of the same side of an old Democratic Party with stale ideas and a mindset of incremental growth. We simply don‚Äôt have time to try to play nice with Republicans. They don‚Äôt care about working class values and families why should we care about them?  That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt in good conscience vote for any candidate who‚Äôs platform includes ‚Äúlet‚Äôs reach across the aisle‚Äù platitudes. No. It‚Äôs time to straight up victimize Republicans and their donors. If our planet is going to be saved for future generations we have to eat the rich and make sure that everyone in America regardless of any mitigating factors gets a living wage, healthcare, freedom from crippling student loan debt and access to educational opportunities on an unprecedented scale.
Okay, edited. Will watch out next time.
Eh, I saw in a political discussion thread upvoted comments from Bernie supporters suggesting that if Bernie picks the wrong VP, they won't vote for him in the general.   Stuff like that is why the narrative has legs, not saying you think that way.
Congresswoman Katie Porter Is a National Hero, Gets CDC to Commit to Free Coronavirus Testing
From what I've heard/seen, Katie Porter seems like a Warren Democrat right?
Katie Porter not only took Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs class at Harvard, but also became her research assistant, co-wrote one of her textbooks, became a law professor herself because of Elizabeth, asked Warren about running for office herself, became one of the few progressives to flip a seat red to blue, and named her daughter Elizabeth!
That was a beautiful line of questioning. It also makes me very thankful that modern medical school curricula touch on out-of-pocket expenses for these very common labs/procedures so that we can have a better handle on cost-effective medicine (because heaven forbid we go to single payer :/ )
She's great. I did just receive mail from her: Polls are showing her reelection is in jeopardy, and "Now *MSNBC* is reporting that Trump wants revenge against me. He flew to California last month to raise millions to defeat me and other House Democrats."   For those inclined, here's the [triple match donation link from the email](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_ecu_fr_2020_porter-surrogate?akid=30623.3740793.62pc3w&amount=50&amounts=100%2C350%2C650%2C900&rd=1&recurring=auto&refcode=MS_EM_FR_2020.03.12_B6_EndCitizensUnited-Porter_X__F1_S1_C1__7-ac_RS&refcode2=30623_3740793_62pc3w&t=3).
she's my rep and has been kicking ass since she took office. Proud, especially considering Orange County is notoriously republican
That's good news. Congresswoman Katie Porter deserves everyone's gratitude.  But, I can't help thinking that Trump et al will renege on their promise
Good on her for persisting. Shame that it takes such efforts for the smallest and most sensible concessions.
Yay Katie Porter, but The CDC will never keep their end of the deal unfortunately. I have such little faith in government right now.
Women win, and not just elections.
This is the kind of leadership I can get behind!
She really is. If Warren decides not to run for President again -- if she decides she's too old by 2024 (or 2028) -- I very much hope Katie Porter can pick up her reigns and continue the charge. I'm sure nothing would make Elizabeth more proud.
I love her!
Absolute legend. She is so inspiring
Katie Porter is one of my favorite people in Congress right now.
Just cause he said it on camera does not mean Trump will let it happen.
Please donate to her campaign so she can continue to do good work for the American People.    &#x200B;  [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/pccc\_bp\_porter](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/pccc_bp_porter)
Are we sure that this commitment is real? I love what she did but I worry that this is potentially another layer of false information.
I'm so glad I volunteered for her campaign last cycle.
Their word doesn't matter.
100%
Sounds like it just proves we need healthcare for all.
Bra-vo!
I hope that‚Äôs true.  If so that‚Äôs awesome
#Congresswoman Katie Porter for President!
[removed]
She is Warren‚Äôs former student and explicitly endorsed her for president
She's [one of three co-chairs](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1197930289827385344) on Warren's campaign. That's about as Warren Democrat as they come.
Porter even named her daughter after Warren! üò≠  ‚ÄúShe's a wonderful, wonderful teacher, a wonderful mentor. I mean, my daughter is named Elizabeth, I mean, we're close.‚Äù https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/holding-washington-accountable-rep-katie-porter-podcast-transcript-ncna1042541
Smart and effective? Probably a Warren Democrat.
She's one of the few (maybe only?) people to flip a Republican seat in 2018 while running on a progressive agenda.
Yes, she was a surrogate for Warren campaign. She also took one of Warren's classes at Harvard I think
She was a student of Liz at Harvard, so yeah.
Porter 2028?
She was her campaign co-chair too! She's pretty amazing, I live in CA, really hope she runs for senate when Feinstein retires in a few years.
So great.   As a woman demonstrating the leadership she was *elected* for, she‚Äôs probably being described as ‚Äúshrill‚Äù and ‚Äúalarmist‚Äù by Fox and the right.
She was also a surrogate for Warren's campaign.  Warren Democrats get sh\*t done!
God damn. Hopefully in the time to come more progressive people (particularly women) like AOC and Porter make waves and finally get this country to a decent place with a woman president. Either way Warren has clearly made impacts in younger generations. Very proud to have caucused for her.
Current medical student here - I‚Äôm not going to say that it‚Äôs the #1 priority, but healthcare disparities, out of pocket expenses, and the systematic problems in our healthcare system are certainly emphasized in our curriculum and are not taken lightly. A majority of my class supports MFA (though I am in a very liberal and diverse city). I‚Äôd like to think that my generation of physicians have a different perspective on these issues, and that going to med school knowing that you will be 300,000 dollars in student loan debt before you turn 30 is attracting a slightly different pool of applicants. I guess time will tell, but I really hope that I‚Äôm right.
From what I heard, the government official walked back his promise shortly afterwards.
That direct link goes half to her and half to something called End Citizens United. The split can be changed though to give it all to her.  Edit: and after I donated it thanked me for a monthly recurring donation. Gave me ten seconds to change it to one time, but that's shady as hell.
I'm from a nearby district (hi neighbor) and I've been extremely impressed with her. I'm also pleasantly surprised how much her district seems to like her! I figured she'd be in deep trouble with reelection, given the history and makeup of the district, but current primary results have her over 50%.
From what I heard, the government official walked back his promise shortly afterwards.
Why stop at one Warren Democrat? Hell, let‚Äôs get a ticket with both Ayanna Pressley and Katie Porter‚Äî don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs on top. Can‚Äôt think of anything better! :))
The Hero we need right now.
Removed for Rule 7.  Unless you have proof that hospitals will not be able to perform tests (in which case, provide proof), do not provide statements about their ability to respond to a public health crisis.
[removed]
Yeah that tracks haha
Makes me so sad Warren is not the nominee. She was the best candidate by miles. Not by electability, but with smarts and policies.
And named her daughter after her professor and mentor, Elizabeth Warren.
She supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Warren in this Primary. Unclear who she supports now.
[removed]
This is actually what happened all over Orange County, my rep is a neighbor a district or two away from her and ran on a similarly progressive platform in a historically more red district
Yes, she said Elizabeth Warren was [terrifying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP3pEwwdXpE) to have as a professor.
I love me some Porters. And stouts.  The memes write themselves here
I wonder what emoji misogynists will choose that year üôÑ
Porter 2024.
Sorry about that. Yeah, you have to be careful about the donation links. I have been successful changing monthly donations to single days afterwards though.
hi neighbor :) yes, I think beyond her work, people here love her because she has regular town halls with us. The last one I tried to go to filled up really quickly!
Removed for Rule 2.  Please do not use "retarded" as an insult.  Also, please don't make personal attacks (Rule 3).
[removed]
if this is serious, it's because they're much better at policy and work on the floor than they are at campaigning. they're very different things, but the great campaigners are obviously rewarded much more. one of many faults in our system. george w. bush for example was a brilliant campaigner who played up faux cluelessness to appeal to the american majority, and is remembered (fairly) as a poor president by most on both sides. but he won twice, and deserves credit for running his campaign so well.  warren marketed herself as a planner, and that appeals to pragmatic americans, which are not the majority. it was her only option though, because this is what she's good at, and why she got into the senate in the first place and has been re-elected. her history involves an epiphany that led her to switch sides, whereas most americans prefer someone who has held the same opinions for their entire lives. she has made some pretty questionable moves throughout her campaign, i think even the most biased warren supporters would say (some of her discussions about medicare, the quarrel with bernie, a few select interviews, etc.). but there are no questions about her track record in the senate, and really very little about how effective her policies would be either.
No harm done. Just hoping to help others pay closer attention than I did when I went through the process.
I'm not a fan of Sanders. And while Biden is definitely not my number one choice he has a much better chance of winning the presidency. Bernie can't even win Washington.
Well based on the current results, what makes you think we wouldn‚Äôt get 4 more years of Trump if Bernie was elected as the nom?
We should choose the nominee with less support? Really? The candidate with a mountain of baggage, who Trump and the GOP are openly rooting for? The candidate being propped up by Russia for the second election in a row? The 78 year-old man who refused to drop out after having a heart attack? And reneged on his promise to release full medical records?  You've got to be completely delusional to believe Sanders is more electable than Biden, considering the latter is driving high turnout and the former can't even get his base to show up.
Disagree.  Her policies were too left facing for the average voter, as evidenced by her exit.  The Chief Executive has to be more than a planner.  S/he needs to be a leader who can inspire others to action.
Warren couldn't win her home state tho....
You phrase that like "Washington" and "the presidency" are different stages in the same contest. They're not.
Polling which suggests Bernie would beat Trump in a head-to-head matchup.
I never said Warren was electable, just that shes smart and would make a great president.
He's losing swing states too. How's he going to win the presidency if he cant beat Biden in Michigan?
General election polling this far out is worthless. Almost no correlation to reality
I mean the polling said Hillary would beat Trump, and yet here we are...
You are ignoring the polling that also had Bernie ahead of Biden until he wasn't.  There is no certainty that those head to head where he polls ahead of Trump won't turn on its head like it did with Biden
So why is Biden winning exactly? Does it not make more sense to coalesce around the guy that has the majority of the democratic party‚Äôs support?
The main reason people cited voting for Biden over Sanders is "electability." If, be magically won the primary, the "electability" argument would be invalid because it doesn't matter in the general.
What???? As a Warren supporter, I had *NO IDEA* that this was true!!
Elizabeth Warren: "It‚Äôs a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate. But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire."
LMAO  Tomorrow better be an absolute roast.
Ask him how he feels about:  1. Pregnant women at his work  2. Blacks and latinos at work.  3. What nationality is most prone to being a criminal.   Lol.  He will be done by 10pm.
Oh boy, I better get some popcorn for tomorrow.
Warren needs a singular, surgical, memorable strike against Bloomberg, early in the debate.   After that, she needs to focus on her message- why she's the best person for the job. Leave all subsequent mudslinging to Amy, her campaign is built on hot takes right now. And Bernie, he too is campaigning specifically against the billionaires like Bloomberg and Trump.   Warren doesn't need to be the heavy hitter. She needs to position as the most trustworthy to heal a divided party, and lead a fractured country away from the brink. That's her unique strength, she just needs to lean into it and get her message across.   We are very likely going to a brokered convention. If it comes to that, Bernie supporters are going to swing hard for him to lead without compromise. The moderate establishment is going to do the same for someone like Amy or Pete. Warren is where I think the party actually ends up agreeing: Bernie without the vitriol. Professional. Presidential.
I think Bloomberg is ready for Sanders primarily. It'd be political malpractice not to know that he's going to literally face a circular firing squad, and so I have to assume he's prepared. (I may not think much of him as a pol, but he has literally paid for the best managers he can buy.) Because of that, I'm curious how Warren will handle her progressive flank.  I do want Warren to continue showing her acerbic wit and continuing to have an edge, however the unity message might resonate a lot if she's the only one out there fighting for it. The problem is, how much airtime will she get? She destroyed Pete last debate with one word, but the words before and after were few and far between, and you can't get that message out if you don't get called.  But Warren knows this debate could change the trajectory of her entire campaign moving into Super Tuesday. I'm excited to see what her gameplan is and how much she's going to fucking body Bloomberg.
Spicy Warren is the Best Warren.
The gloves are off, now it‚Äôs time for a knockout
Bloomberg is going after Bernie, Warren is going after Bloomberg. Question is, will Bernie go on the offensive and dig at Bloomberg and Pete or will he stay on his same message. I also think the other moderates will go after Bernie. Either way it‚Äôs going to be messy.
Bernie supporter here, and I absolutely love this. Let's keep up the good fight against the real enemies- Trump, Bloomberg, and their billionaire cabal.
Perfect!
I can‚Äôt wait to watch Liz knock him down quite a few pegs.
I think a lot of people will tune in to see Bloomberg debate, and that it‚Äôs imperative for Warren to have an amazing night tomorrow. I‚Äôd love to see her come with the perfect mixture of a) staying on brand with her core message b) showing that she can take on and take down the giant ego billionaires, i.e. Donald Trump and c) OUTRIGHT SAYING (no more subtly implying) that she is THE unity candidate to connect the bridge between the center and the left of the party.
As messed up as it was to change the rules for debates so Bloomberg could participate... I do think that Warren going after Bloomberg will make him regret getting up on the stage in the first place. Too many people only know him for his ads and not his history right now. It might be too much to ask but I really want another memeable moment like Warren had with Delaney.   Plus I think that all the other candidates will go after him hard too. Bernie will almost definitely go for his throat. Biden, Klobuchar and Pete will be able to simultaneously go for Bloomberg's throat while demonstrating the difference between them as moderate dems and Bloomberg who has only held office as a Republican (and an independent) and has a history of ***very*** not Democrat friendly policies. I honestly can't imagine Bloomberg not being the main target for everyone on stage.
Stuff like this is why I love Warren.  I just REALLY hope they don't make this debate about him.  Only answer his questions or his falsehoods, but otherwise ignore him like the non-contender he should be.
Hell yes! LFG!
This should be a real thriller. Warren is at her best with a foil and Bloomberg is.... well, the perfect one.

Given all the other people on stage have been in debates for the past 6 months means Bloomberg is the underdog, I hope he falls hard otherwise the media will give him the benefit of the doubt.  I'm mostly curious if Bloomberg will attack the progressives, moderates, or try and stay focused on Trump and defending his own policies rather than attacking others....should be an interesting debate.
She needs to make a point that she's the only one on the stage unafraid to Lock Them Up.  Even Bernie won't commit to investigations and prosecutions of the Trump administration its agents, donors and co-conspirators.
I know the Biden /Pete/Amy moderates and the Bernie/Warren teams love to hate on each other's ideologies sometimes, especially on Reddit. But god I hope all the candidates team up to slaughter his reputation. Billionaires shouldn't exist. It's ridiculous. And especially not as a president.
Sick burn, Madame President.

The replies to this tweet are very entertaining!
She needs to be careful though. Not that she won‚Äôt be prepared, but I remember his NYC mayoral campaigns. He‚Äôs an uninspiring public speaker, but a vicious debater with absolutely no qualms about punching low. She needs to try and avoid the counterpunch. Methodical shredding might be a better approach than Amy‚Äôs takedown style.  Also I really believe she needs to draw contrast with Bernie and fast. Point out his M4A plan is garbage, point out his platform is fantasy if he doesn‚Äôt intend on nuking the filibuster or packing the courts, point out that she‚Äôs got real progressive stuff done against fierce opposition...literally anything
Hoping for a simple couple minutes where the 5 (Steyer didn't make it?) lay off each other for a bit and just lay into Bloomberg. Not for the whole debate ..but you know.  In general I like and respect the 5 who will be on the stage, even if I have a myriad of issues with them. Bloomberg has not earned that respect.  And yes, to be clear, if he wins the nom- I will vote for him.
Stop and frisk Bloomberg.
I did want her to go after Bernie too, at least a little, but if she‚Äôs going to have to drop after ST, which polling indicates looks likely now Bloomberg has surged to 20% literally everywhere, even in freaking Massachusetts, then I guess she‚Äôs going to be the heroic team player she‚Äôs always been and go all out trying to crater this motherfucker
I have a feeling tomorrow‚Äôs debate will consist mostly of all the candidates ganging up on Bloomberg. Him being in the race is favorable to absolutely no one.
Holy fuck she is awesome.
Bernie supporter here, this is amazing! Can't wait to see two progressives tag-teaming dunks on Bloomberg LMAO
Warren should stay focus on her  message. If there is anyone she want to fight against, she should target  Trump. This is what really unite democrats. I think anti-corruption is a  good message. All these can be tied to a winning message [research found](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21116867/ian-haney-lopez-merge-left-race-class-project-trump-racism-dog-whistles-2020-democrats):  >No  matter where we come from or what our color is, most of us work hard   for our families, but today, certain politicians and their greedy   lobbyists hurt everyone by handing kickbacks to the rich, defunding our   schools, and threatening seniors with cutting Medicare and Social   Security. Then they turn around and point the finger for hard times at   poor families, black people, and new immigrants. We need to join   together with people from all walks of life to fight for our future,   just like we won better wages, safer workspaces, and civil rights in our   past. By joining together, we can elect new leaders who work for all  of  us, not just the wealthy few.  This  message attacks Trump and implicitly attacks some candidates already,  but the focus is on helping voters rather than criticizing other  candidates. This style of attack also seems to work better for women  politicians as [Amy Klobuchar demonstrated](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21136816/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-endorse-amy-klobuchar):  >And  I will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy  in the White House right now.And I will bring that to you. If you have  trouble  stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent, I know you, and I  will  fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if you‚Äôre going pay  for your  child care or your long-term care, I know you, and I will  fight for  you. If you have trouble figuring out if you‚Äôre going to fill  your  refrigerator or fill your prescription drug, I know you, and I  will  fight for you.  If Warren attacks like some male candidates do or like she did previously, she will likely be [dinged](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/14/21136816/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-endorse-amy-klobuchar):  >Palmieri [wrote](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/02/13/amy-klobuchar-sexism-jennifer-palmieri-225026) for Politico magazine how the qualities that are celebrated in male politicians are liabilities for women:   Stories  about intimidating male bosses are  typically not presented as  disqualifying, but as evidence of these men  as formidable leaders.  These are men who should not be underestimated.  These are men who  should be respected.
That is Savage!
It does feel like he has bought his way into the election. It feels like he is trying to buy the election. This is after he said he **wouldn't** be running. What made him change his mind?  He was our mayor for 12 years and a lot of people here- don't like him. Stop and frisk is one of those reasons. And he has been showing a lot more reasons for people to not trust him than him throwing money around to get into an election late.  [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/17/michael-bloomberg-more-past-controversial-remarks](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/17/michael-bloomberg-more-past-controversial-remarks)  [https://www.gq.com/story/bloomberg-sexism](https://www.gq.com/story/bloomberg-sexism)
o snap
I for one think it's good to get him on stage for this very reason. Everyone else has been grilling each other for months, he shouldn't get a free ride.
We need all the candidates to call out the hypocracy of the DNC allowing Bloomberg to debate after not allowing Castro and Booker and gravel in the very first debate.  A billionaire shouldn't be able to buy his way in.    I can see Bernie and Elizabeth taking the gloves off and going after Bloomberg
This is awesome.
Hey, Bernie supporter here. I got caught up in stupid internet politics and started to dislike Warren because of the whole ‚Äúsexist Bernie‚Äù debacle.  This tweet reminded me how much we have in common. Kick ass in this next debate. Love y‚Äôall.
[removed]
Mods will remove this post for splitting Democrats in 3... 2... 1...
It can only be a roast if the debate moderators let it. If they give Mike all the speaking time it won't be.  Someone needs to utterly emasculate Bloomberg on stage though. Tons of his supporters think he's some "tough guy" who Trump can't bully because they've internalized a bunch of Fox News bullshit about how Democrats are sissies.   Warren and Sanders are a given for tearing into him, but I'm really hoping for Klobuchar, and her palpable disdain for everyone around her, to bring some aerodynamic throwing binders to the party.
The roast of mike Bloomberg hosted by Elizabeth warren and I can‚Äôt wait
I‚Äôm expecting roasts of Bloomberg and Bernie honestly, there‚Äôs been a lot of push back against both of them this week. This should be the messiest debate yet.
They all want him on the stage because everyone currently just gets his "Obama endorsed" commercials.... I really wish Obama would speak out about that.
I'm a little concerned that everyone will pile on Bloomberg and no one (except Bloomberg himself, of course) will criticize Bernie and he will once again skate through a debate without having to face any real criticism despite the fact that he's the front-runner.
God I hope it's an absolute massacre.
Wish granted.
Narrator: It was.
Can hardly wait for the long knives to come out - thank you Mike for giving just about everybody on the debate stage a common enemy!
Man did Warren ever deliver the goods. God tier debate domination.
Warren's best lane to attack Bloomberg is that he pretends to be a numbers guy but his stop-and-frisk racist fascism numbers never added up. It wasn't "reasonable suspicion", it was "racist suspicion."
[removed]
The best part is that **all** of the other 5 candidates have essentially promised/telegraphed that they will go after Bloomberg at the debate:  [Warren](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1229850791562956801): "It‚Äôs a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate. But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire."  [Klobuchar](https://twitter.com/cnnsotu/status/1229052435378974725): "I don‚Äôt think you should be able to hide behind airwaves and huge ad buys. I know I‚Äôm not going to be able to beat \[Bloomberg\] on the airwaves but I can beat him on the debate stage."  [Sanders](https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/1229515194226925578): "Mr. Bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president. He does not have a right to buy the presidency."  [Buttigieg](https://twitter.com/nbcnewspr/status/1229905414726266880): "\[Bloomberg\] has to answer for his treatment of others, for his language, and above all for an attitude that seems to have dismissed the humanity of a lot of people."  [Biden's campaign adviser Symone Sanders](https://twitter.com/meetthepress/status/1229901649151451136): "In my opinion, \[Bloomberg\] is unvetted. And he has spent the bulk of this week weathering headlines on everything from his ... expansion of stop-and-frisk to sexual harassment in his company to today what he has said about transgender people in America."  Honestly looking forward to this weird unity moment where every single other candidate tells bloomy to GTFO.
She needs to hammer on how she has the best anti-corruption plan and how that‚Äôs her first priority. ‚ÄúUnity candidate‚Äù positioning can come later ‚Äî she doesn‚Äôt have to be viciously attack others, but she needs to get back into fighting mode first. Have her corruption plan be the focus and position it as ‚Äúwithout returning power to the people, nothing else said on this stage will matter‚Äù. Then use her actual achievement with the Consumers Finance Protection Bureau of actually having recovered money for citizens, and her previous positions on prosecuting and jailing bankers.
she needs soundbites, which is the unfortunate but true aspect of modern media.   She lost much of the college educated base in NH to Amy, so she could team with Pete to attack her on her fumble regarding the president of Mexico.   She needs some of the progressive vote, so she could continue to say that she represents everyone, and not defend Bernie by the inevitable attacks from Bloomberg and maybe Pete. Attacking Bernie may be opportune, but is also a risk. An effective attack could cripple Sanders chances, but a flub would kill any chance some progressives from considering her in the primary.   She has to make inroads with the working class and minority voters particularly for the next two contests, so she should highlight her plans regarding the future of work and how it‚Äôs better than Trump‚Äôs plan   Overall, she could take a page from Pete‚Äôs book - Do not attack on stage unless instigated, but shame anyone who attacks. She should lean on her experience, where she has more significant legislative experience in comparison to anyone else on stage minus maybe Biden. That is one possible implicit Sanders jab. She should also mention being the third in delegate count, which would make her appear more of a front-runner and could serve as a tie-breaker for many
Liz and Bernie tag team! LFG!
I too am a Bernie supporter and I too fucking loved this.
Literally all she has to do is ask why he fund-raised for the Republican instead of the Democrat in the 2012 MA Senate election, and why anyone should take him seriously when he'd rather see a Republican in office then a Democrat.  Then she can pull a Harris and say... "That democratic candidate... was me! And I won that election, by the way."
Honestly I'm surprised he is even going on a debate, he seems to be doing well just throwing money at tv ads
If they ignore him, he will continue to be a contender. Everyone else on that stage needs to rip his mask off Scooby Doo style and let everyone see the fascist he is
Will it convince you to back her first?
I don‚Äôt understand how in the same thread of people saying Warren is a ‚Äúunity candidate‚Äù there are comments saying Sanders‚Äô M4A plan is ‚Äúgarbage.‚Äù Like lol cmon, how do you even expect  Bernie supporters to play nice when you say things like that.
Yeah, Bernie being sexist really made me dislike Warren too. Thanks for stopping by.
Removed for rule 11. I suggest you review the rules prior to participating in this sub.
I expect Klobuchar to lash out fiercely. Her campaign already saw major results from that in NH when she attacked Pete.  It will actually be pretty telling if the centrist candidates go easy on him though.
> It can only be a roast if the debate moderators let it. If they give Mike all the speaking time it won't be.  If every response is addressed at him, he will be allotted the time to have a rebuttal. Which is why her "attack" should be brief and to the point, and hopefully pretty much singular. He's also not the front runner. She needs to get HER points in.
[deleted]
I hope Bloomberg gets the full Michael Bennet treatment!
So not to be that person but...let‚Äôs temper our expectations just a bit. While I do think that Liz and other Democrats will land some good points on Bloomberg, I would also suspect Bloomberg will have quite a few things to punch back with.  After all, a few million dollars will get you a long way and probably a pretty decent debate prep team.  After 2016, we need to take everyone seriously, no matter how much we disagree with their campaign and them as people. Underestimating Bloomberg is a bad idea.
Yes, especially since his Obama "endorsement" is a blatant lie. Bloomberg endorsed Obama in 2012, a week before the election and with a statement that read like he was endorsing Romney.
Amy has said in an interview she hopes he makes it. Bloomberg is taking voters from others in the moderate lane (her, Pete, Biden), according to polling.
I could see Bernie leaving most of this work to Warren, then sit by with vague comments as his supporters continue to lie about her M4A plan and call her a snake just like Warren took all the heat on M4A a few months back. Warren should lash out at everyone about policy in strong and fair ways. She's been too gentle while being accused of being too harsh.
I agree with this. Bernie‚Äôs been coasting through these debates because nobody‚Äôs taking him on. Compare to when Liz was the frontrunner and spent two hours having to knock back 7 people at once.
Kind of hoping for that outcome, if I'm 100% honest.
That is what will happen, but sadly Bernie is the lesser of two evils.
bernie is not the front runner.
Yep lol  Warren is not giving him an ***inch***
Hey. This hurts my soul but I have to remove for rule four. Please refrain from calling him a far-right republican. Link to the proposals you disagree with or criticize them using facts.
I 100% think that this is the move, imo. Steal some thunder from the moderate wing who wants to do exactly what Bloomberg wants to do without being a plutocrat, and show that an academic with a working class background who isn't disgustingly corrupt can fight back for working people instead of pushing the status quo.  Unity can come later, after we agree that corruption needs to be rooted out. A party that tolerates Bloomberg isn't a party that ought to represent the Democratic coalition -- and it won't win against Trump.
Yes good point. Hammer the anti-corruption point home, stick to that message. Stick to the Plans.   She should pitch herself as the best candidate for president based on her plans and accomplishments.   She cannot market herself as a 'unity' candidate, because that doesn't mean anything - it's just a relative property of where the division in a brokered convention may fall.
I think there was a similar dynamic in the July debate and if it‚Äôs anything like that then sign me up !
The "he's too much of a coward to debate" narrative would be as deadly as whiffing a debate.
the more you attack him, the more time he gets to attack others, which if they mention him again, gives him more time to attack others. This is what Trump did, and what Bloomberg could do to create a scourched earth where all criticisms from all candidates are lessened by the sheer amount of them being juggled around. I‚Äôm more than willing to bet this is the game plan, since his ads so far are mainly attacks on Trump or other Candidates (mainly Bernie).    This strategy also may work because of the fact that some of the more loud-spoken Bernie camp have been actively criticizing candidates (some which are valid) above promoting Bernie‚Äôs platform. This may create a ‚Äúboy who cried wolf‚Äù scenario, where any new attempts to call and other D candidate ‚Äúnot progressive enough‚Äù or a ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù will land on mostly deaf ears   I worry about Bloomberg, and with his ability to buy ads, and everyone should be. He will greatly impact Super Tuesday, and the only way to stop him would be to stop his personal ad buys, which I can‚Äôt think of a way of stopping. Calling him a billionaire, a republican, a racist, and any other simple label will likely not work despite evidence of those things. The best way in the debate to handle him would probably be to amplify his few positive messages (which he will buy ads for and maybe give free advertising ), and only attack him when his attacks can be thrown directly against him. Do not give him more speaking time than necessary, but call him out when a simple sound bite could invalidate any attack or statement he makes
[deleted]
‚ÄòUnity‚Äô doesn‚Äôt mean not vetting the candidates or pointing out their flaws  I criticized the plan, not the person. I‚Äôm playing far nicer than Sanders people swarming Twitter with snakes.
[removed]
I think Amy's going to concentrate on Pete. She needs to sink him by Super Tuesday and  thinks she has a real shot at doing so (and I don't think she's wrong in that). Plus, she seems to genuinely loathe the man.
My predictions: Obviously the centrist candidates will use Bloomberg as an opportunity to attack from the cultural left. But more importantly, Amy and Pete will try to attack him on his history of economic policies, since it gives them a rare opportunity to portray themselves aligning with economic populism (even though they aren't). These attacks should fall flat, but wont, because the media will pick up soundbites and amplify them to a degree. Biden's attacks will be the weakest (he's never been able to launch a successful attack, and he is the candidate most similar to Bloomberg in terms of message, policy history)  Warren will also attack from both angles, but she will focus on his economic policies and political unaccountability as a billionaire. If you ask me, she should focus on the economic policies like redlining, austerity, etc. This is the best way for her to draw direct comparison to her strength as a protector of the working people. Everybody and their Aunt will be talking about stop and frisk, she doesn't need to cover this. For her to be designated the winner of the debate by the media, she needs to be the most vocal but also draw the most important distinction between her and Bloomberg.  Sanders will of course bring attention to Bloomberg's status as an oligarch, republican billionaire. This is par for the course and the media won't really give it much attention.  I think Bloomberg will respond by pay lip service to having changed since 2012, and that all the attacks from the other candidates show they're divisive. He'll then repeat his stump speech about "Mike can do it". This won't land with the audience (we've been hearing variations of this from Biden and Buttigieg for months), but again gives more unneeded exposure to his one and only campaign message when the next day media cycle shows these clips.
>I can easily see Biden attacking him for trying to buy his way into the election as well as trying to use Obama's legacy to get his foot in the door.  It's just depressingly hilarious to imagine the dripping irony of a situation where Biden is indignantly attacking Bloomberg for falsely claiming Obama's support to get his foot in the door when that has been the essence of Biden's entire 2020 run. Especially as Obama hasn't even endorsed Biden.
A few mil and a team of talented/smart people who actually believed in him didn‚Äôt help magically make Biden‚Äôs debate performances any good. If you don‚Äôt got it, you don‚Äôt got it. And if his campaign trail is anything to go by, Bloomer don‚Äôt got it.
How did your expectations go haha
The couple of debates I watched had the moderators asking Warren questions about M4A and Bernie WANTED to be asked the questions and jumped at the opportunity when asked.   I didn't watch thd NH debate because I was at work but from what I heard, the media said she was too restrained. NPR said that, maybe they are the only ones.  Honestly seeing Warren and Bernie supporters attack each other constantly is incredibly dumb.
I don't know why you would hope for that outcome unless you were a Sanders supporter.
I mean, I agree with that, but if we want Warren to win, we have to get people to switch from Bernie to her. I don't know how we do that if we never get to a place where Bernie has to face any substantive criticism from a trustworthy presidential contender in a debate.
I guess murdering everyone on stage is one path to the nomination
uh...I mean...Far-right republican isn't an attack or an insult, its a label. the label is based on his very recent history as a republican and his support of far right republican politicians. I also didn't even say that "He" is a republican... I said his economic politics were aligned with republican economic politics. If i were to say Bernie isn't a democrat, he's an independent, I don't think that would be removed
She needs to get back to ‚ÄúI Have A Plan For That‚Äù. That was an insanely good message. And then it disappeared. Even her most recent ad featuring anti-corruption was ‚ÄúI have a *bill* for that‚Äù. Back to plans and policy and fighting for them.
[removed]
I‚Äôm in the same position. I really really hope it‚Äôs Liz because she‚Äôs better, but I‚Äôll happily pull the lever for Bernie here in Wyoming if that looks more pragmatic.
Last time I checked ‚ÄúGarbage‚Äù isn‚Äôt an actual critique.   Secondly, if emojis bother you, dare I say life has been pretty good to you then.
Not about Warren so it‚Äôll probably get removed but I just wanna say as Warren supporters, we have a duty to call out lies surrounding Bernie‚Äôs health when we see them.
100% in support of this.  As an aside, I am quite fucking pleased with this subreddit.  Everything about Bernie's health has been well wishes and optimism that he'll be back out on the trail in no time.  I'm not seeing anyone making this into anything more than it is. (or its being downvoted to the negatives)
Agreed. Democrats (Liz, Bernie, or others) are a lot more likely to win if we are a united party of decency that cares about each other. When a family member has a routine surgery and a good prognosis, a decent family doesn't dive into arguing about who gets their stuff. The 24 hour news cycle encourages us all to speculate about who "wins" from new developments in elections. In moments like these, it's not a good habit.
I guess it's technically off topic but it's an important message so I think we can give it a pass. Thank you for spreading positivity!
I haven't seen any rumors being spread in this small sub and I object to the claim that rumors are coming from here, but I'll keep an eye out in the deafening forest that is /r/politics. In this sub, everyone has been supportive of Bernie. Warren even sent his team dinner and cookies.
Visitor from the Sanders camp here; I can only speak for myself but the sentiment is appreciated!
Bernie is my #1, and Warren is my #2. I like them both quite a lot and would be thrilled with either as president. So, on behalf of the Bernie camp, thank you for being awesome.  A lot of people really want our camps to hate each other, as if preferring one is incompatible with liking the other. But if either of our candidates are to win, then we'll probably need to all be *constantly* extending olive branches and offering little kindnesses to each other to compensate for the people in our respective camps who struggle with walking the line between amiable comparison and tribal hostility. For my part, I'll be sure to speak up within my camp for Warren when there's an opportunity to repay the favor.  But apart from being thankful for speaking up for my candidate as you've done, I also just want to thank you for demonstrating a more positive way of politicking. *This* is what unity feels like. Thank you.
Agreed, and I certainly have been when I see them. Now if we could just reciprocate and quash lies about Warren being a corporate backed politician coming from the Sanders camp, that would be great.
Damn straight.
I hope for a speedy and full recovery, so he can get back to campaigning. He is too valuable as a voice and force for good to see him down, albeit temporarily.   Signed,   A full-blown L-Dubber
Thanks OP for the good vibes.
Agree, and that's one of the things I love about Warren and Bernie.  They are 2 sides to the same coin. I love them both.
>none of this calls into question his viability.  Unpopular opinion, but it does. I agree we should wish him well and support him and his campaign and I really hope he gets back on his feet soon and continues to help the progressive movement. That said, it's perfectly reasonable to be a little worried about this going forward. I don't think it's a deciding factor. I don't think this alone changes minds, but it it's a perfectly valid concern.   We can support Bernie and his campaign without spreading disinformation.
I don't know man, my father is Bernie's age and if this happened to him I would want him to rest and take the advice of his doctors. Flying is hard on the heart. Keeping long hours and running around is hard on the heart. Getting fired up about politics is hard on the heart. So you're saying "call out lies" but one lie is that everything is fine and there's nothing to see here. That is not true. This is a serious problem and if the drs hadn't caught it in time, he probably would have had a heart attack. I'm really pleased that didn't happen, and I wish the best for him and his family. That doesn't mean waving it away and acting like it's nothing, that means being respectful of whatever decision he makes.
I hope the guy gets better and everything but the Bernie Bros swarmed all over Hillary when she had pneumonia, so I don't feel duty-bound to go out of my way to educate people about his heart condition, about which I don't know that much. I'm not going to speculate, but neither am I going to go to bat for him.
I've seen a few posts attacking Bernie's health scare as some sort of ploy to get more media attention or sympathy with the hashtag #Warren2020. They're so tone-deaf, but I can't help but get the feeling that among these people are those trying to sow bad blood between the Warren and Sanders campaigns.
As a Bernie supporter, I really appreciate this sub for not making Bernie's ailments a political pawn move. Shows that we all still have some humility in this political climate. Hopefully, we can urge further collaboration between the two front running progressives!
It should not become standard politics to celebrate illness in any of our fellow Americans. While Bernie may have gone about it in a way we disagree with, he has still spent his entire life in service to THIS COUNTRY. In this day and age that can‚Äôt be taken for granted in our elected officials. Bernie Sanders deserves to love a long life surrounded by grateful fellow citizens.
This was very nice of u guys! I appreciate it. I am a Bernie supporter first and I really don‚Äôt like it when the Bernie guys treat Warren like she‚Äôs the next Hillary. But tbf, they also have some fair criticisms of her. They just over-exaggerate it. The only people who do post fake news about Warren are Marxists and Communists. Bernie is their knight in shining armour. And honestly, even if Warren was an angel, they would find something to smear her with. It‚Äôs disgusting but they are not affiliated with Bernie‚Äôs campaign or represent his supporters. Most of his supporters are low income working class people who just want to fight for economic and social change. They‚Äôre good people. Yes, u are going to get the bad eggs too. Bernie‚Äôs hardcore following is easily bigger than Donald Trump‚Äôs. Bernie was the fastest candidate to 1 million individual donors and beat his own record by more than 2 months. So naturally some people are going to get carried away.
Bernie supporter here, thanks for this. This is how politics should be conducted. Not the post truth sensationalism thats all too prevalent today. Warren is probably my second choice btw.
Berner here, thank you üëç
Misinformation should absolutely be corrected and I am relieved that he is recovering and will be back on the trail soon.  But at the same time, I hate to see people downplay the seriousness of it. That it is a procedure needing to be done so often says more about the sorry state of heart health in this country than anything. I'm glad it's been perfected and helps so many people, but at the end of the day,  he *did* have a blockage.
Absolutely!  I've been a little out of the loop--has this been happening, or is this just a friendly reminder?
I‚Äôm not a bernie supporter, pretty far from it. Now, like you said, I want things to be right. No one, Warren or any other candidate, is gonna get more sympathy out of saying hurtful things about Bernie or his health. I have a lot of grievances around his policies, but I want him to be well and I hope he can be back on the campaign if that is what he chooses to do as soon as possible. Above all he is a human being who is probably pretty scared right now after that health scare‚Äîroutine procedure or not these things scare you as a person, i‚Äôd be more concerned if he wasn‚Äôt scared after it‚Äîand I hope he can recover from this, both physically and mentally.
Here here!
We now know it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúroutine procedure‚Äù. Bernie has a heart attack.
This sub is awesome in that it is extremely positive and specifically tries to stop negative misinformation.   With that said, I'd consider being too positive or glossing over negative news to be misinformation too. A heart attack for a 78 year old is not 'routine' and is extremely serious. It's not the same as Biden's eye or Hillary's dizzy spell. Statistically, this significantly decreased Bernie's life expectancy and that's simply a fact. The median survival time for a person over 75, who has a heart attack is [3.1 years](https://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/acute-coronary-syndrome/study-65-older-mi-patients-die-within-8-years).   It's not fair to him after he single handedly brought the progressive movement back to the spotlight in 2016 but that's just the cards he's been dealt.   I wish him the best of luck and hope he continues to push the progressive movement!
Except it wasn‚Äôt routine, it means he has coronary heart disease which is chronic and can‚Äôt simply be cured. It was, at best, one step short of a heart attack that was caught early. At worst it was an actual heart attack which was described as an ‚Äúartery blockage‚Äù as a euphemism.  It absolutely DOES call into question his viability. Not that it wasn‚Äôt in question already, but this really should drive the point home that a man pushing 80 really probably shouldn‚Äôt be running for President. (Goes for Biden too.) He SHOULD drop out because if he doesn‚Äôt it WILL continue to harm his health and shorten his lifespan, for a race it‚Äôs already become increasingly clear he cannot win.  I wish him the best, but the best for him frankly is to retire to his home, relax, and enjoy his remaining years with his family. He will most likely die earlier than necessary if he tries to keep up the pace he was going. That is no joke or exaggeration. Sugarcoating things in a well-meaning attempt to be nice is not productive. The man will literally die if he continues to campaign as vigorously as he has been. He really oughta take this as a wake-up call. I suspected something was wrong with him health-wise in the last debate, and this actually exceeded my worst fears of what it could be. He needs to stop for his own sake.
I absolutely agree. The progressive movement as it stands today owes its very existence to Bernie Sanders and his performance in the last primary. He's absolutely someone we want, no *need*, around.  I wish him a speedy recovery, and all the best on the campaign trail. Remember: a healthy debate is **good** for the cause!
I think Sanders will be back, I predict in a few weeks he will be back on the trail.  And I think he will be in the debates on the 15th.
Agreed. Bernie and his supporters are our allies and Bernie's procedure was not super serious but of course the media and whoever else thinks they'll benefit from it will make a big deal out of what happened.
Bernie is my number one, but Warren is a close second. Just joined the sub today and this was the first post I saw. Thank you. Solidarity!!
Thank you all, solidarity!
I'm a Bernie bro came here looking for Warren's Q3 numbers but this makes me happy solidarity comrades
Thanks OP - Bernie supporter here and I appreciate that. I know most of us are just really jaded and cynical at this point because decent media coverage in general is always such an uphill battle with Bernie's campaign, so this is actually really nice to see.
We need him in this fight, whether he wins or not. He's so important for popularising the progressive agenda.
I support Bernie but I also rank Warren as my second choice. Seeing the outpouring of support from you guys is wonderful. Thank you.
I think Warren and Sanders have a lot of overlap. Honestly I really like both of them and would be pleased if either ended up on the ticket. I flip flop between the two quite a bit. They‚Äôre both just awesome.
i really hope Bernie Sanders is fine, and i think people making electoral math on who benefits if Bernie drops out the race is disgusting. That being said, I think it's fair to be worried, in good faith, about his health. A heart operation is a serious problem no matter how you put it. If Bernie is capable of continuing the campaign without pushing himself, that's great, but he shouldn't if he can't. Not saying this as a political thing, but as a personal thing.

ROLL TIDE
100% Bernie is such a wonderful person. I wish him the absolute best and the quickest recovery
A heart attack is a heart attack
All Warren supporters need to watch this video  https://youtu.be/-5KZcQ5BRuM
I'm a nurse who's worked in healthcare for 12 years... It wasn't exactly a routine procedure. It was caught quickly before myocardial damage/ischemia, which is good, but Bernie may likely have coronary artery disease and hypertension; he will likely be on blood thinners the rest of his life (which puts him at risk for gastrointestinal hemorrhage), and he runs the risk of having another heart attack or stroke, especially when under stress. I imagine the stress of actually campaigning against Trump would be really bad for senator Sanders.   Anecdotal, but a neighbor who's quite vigorous and active has suffered three myocardial infarctions in three years and gotten stents each time. It's not really a light thing to have happen. Common, maybe (unfortunately), but still quite serious.
As a Bernie/Yang supporter (currently), I'm sad to say that I had two posts here removed by mods for asking legitimate questions trying to clarify some of Liz's positions. Kind of surprising to me just based on how awesome this community appears to be sometimes. I had my questions removed for "trolling"  If anyone here cares to chat with me, just let me know. I'd really appreciate it
Totally disagree with this post. Bernie had health issues that put him in the hospital. He is already past the median lifespan of American men. These are disqualifying facts ahead of a run for the most important job in the world.

While I absolutely do love Bernie (voted for him in 2016) and I don't think this changes too much about his viability, it does draw attention to one of my major problems with him as a candidate. I feel a lot safer that Warren can hold office for 8 years than Bernie. I don't think any progressives are actually lying about his health.
> Bernie is not dropping out  You don't know this.  He has not made an announcement either way.  He has cancelled his campaign events indefinitely.  That's a fact.  > it was a relatively routine procedure  Open heart surgery is never routine.  It may not be an exotic procedure, but it is certainly indicative of heart disease.  > Doctors say he‚Äôs just fine and none of this calls into question his viability.  Interesting you put those two statements together.  Doctors say he is recovering well.  I think it is very likely his discharge paperwork says to take it easy and avoid stress.  > Doctors say ... none of this calls into question his viability.  I need to see a source for this.  If you didn't mean to indicate that doctors made this assessment, be more careful with your sentence structure.  Also, if this isn't a quote from the doctors, then who is it a quote from?  You want to defend Bernie from lies, but you have yet to produce a lie to defend him from.  Yes, there is a lot of speculation out there, but those aren't lies.  Just because people are saying things you don't want to hear doesn't make them lies.    We don't know what Bernie's plans are for his campaign at this point, probably because he hasn't made up his mind yet.  He did just stop a huge ad buy in Iowa.  Why would he do that?    There is a lot we don't know, and there are a lot of questions to be answered.  Pretending like you know those answers is every bit as much propaganda as those pretending that he's on his death bed.

I hope Warren selects Bernie as her VP.
Even if they are competitors at the moment, Bernie is crucial to the progressive left, to democrats, and specifically to Warren's overall chance of success were she to get the nomination. For the time being it's a 1v1 matchup but in the grand scheme they are absolutely in this together.
Agreed. I really doubt it‚Äôs us making a big deal of it out in the other subs. But we shouldn‚Äôt let it slide either imho.
Even Warren herself wished him well and hoped to see him back on the campaign trail soon. While I am a Bernie supporter,  I will have no issue casting my vote for Warren if she wins the primary.
I subscribe to a lot of the candidate subs to get a good overall idea of their viewpoints and all that, and y'all are super wholesome.
Support progressives. It shouldn't be as difficult as it's felt. Good to see most Warren supporters having some intellectual consistency with Bernie even when we haven't always been shown that from his supporters lately
Well I don't know how this sub is but as a Bernie supporter it feels like they're similar enough that both Warren and sanders supporters would still be perfectly pleased no matter which one, so we want both to have the best chance of winning.
I mean, a lot of us probably supported sanders in 2016. Warren and him have similar positions, its just that Warren can explain them better and is younger.
Even just beyond the long-game of conspiracy theories and rumours hurting the Democrats at-large, no matter who the nominee is, it's just the decent thing to do and even small adherence to that can have a huge impact.   I have great respect for Sen. Sanders but have admittedly been miffed by some of his more extreme online following before (understanding Twitter is not real life). During the She the People Forum, when there were a lot of rumours that Mayor Pete was skipping out to avoid having to discuss race (when in fact he was missing it for his father's memorial service) there was one of the Bernie stan accounts responding to a bunch of those Twitter rumours basically saying, "This is not appropriate nor how this campaign should be represented.  There's a time for discussing differences between the candidates and making our case, but this is not it. The man lost his father and his family needs time."
Thanks for allowing it! Hope Bernie can continue to fight for us.
I don‚Äôt know if anyone claimed it was coming from here. I don‚Äôt think it is and I don‚Äôt think anyone really thinks it is. Maybe a tiny bit, inevitably, but mostly positivity.
Also here as a Berner- I second u/Chumstick's sentiment.
We'll all need to come together in the end, one way or another (or even a third way, ugh, reference intentional) to stop the evil clown, and then after it, to repair the nightmare world he's created.  The only way we lose is if we beat ourselves. I don't plan on contributing to that. :-)

Agreed.
Thank you for speaking up on behalf of EW!     I realize that a lot of the anti-Warren hate on Bernie subs is just trolls, but they do it to try and influence real people, so the more people who call them out to prevent them from doing that, the better.
I've learned a lot about stents these past few days. Lots of people saying they felt like a teenager again after the procedure.
> So you're saying "call out lies" but one lie is that everything is fine and there's nothing to see here. That is not true. This is a serious problem and if the drs hadn't caught it in time, he probably would have had a heart attack.  This. Exactly this.   Our only duty is to be factual and grounded in reality. When we see news that is obviously false we should call it out but going too far in the other direction is a problem as well.   This obviously is not good news for the Sanders campaign. We don't have to gloat over it; it would be highly inappropriate to do so. Nevertheless, we can acknowledge that simple fact.
You‚Äôre 100% right. People don‚Äôt go from having chest pains at an event to being rushed to the hospital for immediate emergency heart surgery on a ‚Äúroutine‚Äù basis. That means you either are having a heart attack or are on the brink of one and will probably die if you don‚Äôt get the operation, which they don‚Äôt do on a lark. This is serious business and should not be handwaved away by any means.
I don‚Äôt know if everything is fine. I can‚Äôt know that. I know the doctors say he‚Äôs doing well and I know that we don‚Äôt know his exact medical condition and shouldn‚Äôt speculate in that informational vacuum.
Honestly anyone who has a blockage dislodged and a stent placed  is going to be told by their doctors to avoid long flights or to be getting up frequently during the flight. That was one of my first thoughts worrying for him because his campaign, put him at direct risk .    I'm hoping he continues to do well but it's definitely a concern. While the actual procedure is simple and recovery is simple, the underlying issue that caused the need for a stent is still a risk.
Folks are definitely underplaying it. Frankly, both the health and political impact of it. While it's true that he'll probably be fine after a short recovery, it will (rightfully IMO) reignite the age debate, and the best predictor of future heart problems is past heart problems.  There's absolutely no way a near-80-year-old man who had emergent cardiac catheterization on the campaign trail is going to be the nominee. I say that with all respect to Sanders and I hope he retains his place in the Senate for a long, long time. But he was already polling a distant third and I rate his chance of winning now as less-than-Tulsi.
Bernie is on a mission. He is still going because he cares. It shows in everything he does--he is not in it for himself, and he's even willing to sacrifice his own well being to keep fighting.
I'm not a doctor but I've read from doctors it's entirely possible he did have a heart attack.
[deleted]
Don‚Äôt speculate and don‚Äôt abide by others speculating. You don‚Äôt have to go to bat for him to call out a lie.   No one knows right now, so to claim to know is a lie. To claim his campaign is over is a lie. Even if that turned out to be true, it‚Äôs a lie at the moment and we shouldn‚Äôt participate in or abide that sort of attack.
[deleted]
I agree on both points:  1. There's every reason to correct misinformation. It's not like he had emergency open-heart surgery, and portraying this as such is unfair 2. However, I also think that the Sanders campaign is downplaying this.  The fact is a stent being implanted on short notice either suggests Sanders had a heart attack or unstable angina. I think [this article](https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-diagnosis-stents-chest-pain.html) in Slate explains it well:  >even the scant [information we have](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-78-canceled-events-notice-hospitalized/story?id=66003850)‚Äîthat he had stents inserted overnight following an acute cardiac episode‚Äîis enough to be able to say: **This was very likely a heart attack**. ‚Ä¶¬†unstable angina \[is\] the only alternative to a heart attack. While patients with unstable angina who receive stents often feel better afterward and heart attacks are prevented in a small number of them, the [risks of the procedure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20238333) are considered so **dangerous**‚Äîincluding bleeding, and even the possibility of *inducing* a heart attack‚Äîthat only patients with severe risks and/or severe symptoms should undergo cardiac catheterization.  Moreover, tests could be performed to be determined if it was a heart attack, but either they weren't performed or his campaign isn't reporting the results. The latter seems likely:  >the [Wall Street Journal ran a story](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-cancels-events-until-further-notice-due-to-health-issues-11570027592) that originally stated a spokesperson for Sanders said the senator ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt suffer a heart attack,‚Äù but that story was **later updated to remove that assertion**. The story now states that the spokesperson said ‚Äúmore tests would be run to determine that diagnosis.‚Äù  The article continues to discuss how the tests would take hours and not days to determine if he had a heart attack, so suggesting that they don't know yet doesn't seem realistic.
It‚Äôs one of the most common issues and procedures and he‚Äôs fine now. So, let‚Äôs not turn it into a talking point. You wouldn‚Äôt want that done to Warren if she had a sudden issue. It can happen to anyone and it‚Äôs really not more alarming than anything else. Anyone could have medical issues at any moment but you can‚Äôt factor that into your decision unless they‚Äôre, like, terminal.
I haven‚Äôt seen it here. I‚Äôve seen it on subs like r/politics (from idk which supporters) and on Twitter from all sorts of people including EW supporters (which best I can tell were genuine accounts and not just trolls).  So it‚Äôs a little column A, little column B.
That‚Äôs new information.   It still was a routine procedure, meaning quite common and high rate of survival. My grandfather lived 15 years after his heart attack.   ~ Edit‚Äîfrom the BBC article on this event:   >Receiving stents is "a minimally invasive procedure", typically with a short recovery time, the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute says.‚Äù   Don‚Äôt use someone‚Äôs medical situation to attack them, is the point. It‚Äôs bad faith because we don‚Äôt know who will live and who will die.  If it‚Äôs something voters personally are concerned by, that‚Äôs fine. But we shouldn‚Äôt be participating in rumors and it‚Äôs extremely rude to gossip about someone‚Äôs health and whether you think they will live or die. Keep it to yourself if you have morbid thoughts about him.
nah this ain‚Äôt it. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre genuinely concerned for him, and he is a big boy who can make his own decisions like if he‚Äôs healthy enough to run. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be happy retiring anyhow.
‚ÄúThe progressive movement as it stands today owes its very existence to Bernie Sanders and his performance in the last primary.‚Äù  No. Just no. I like Bernie. I voted for Bernie in the 2016 primary. I just donated to Bernie‚Äôs 2020 campaign just hours before the news about his stent procedure. By all means, please support Bernie and progressive candidates across the board this election. But don‚Äôt buy into a cult of personality for Bernie or anyone else. Bernie is undoubtedly a prominent figure in the American left. But so is AOC, so is Elizabeth Warren, and so are many others in the Democratic Party. We‚Äôve also had decades of far left candidates from the various socialist parties and the Green Party. Attributing EVERYTHING to Bernie is disingenuous and dangerous IMO.  Whether Bernie wins the primary or loses the primary, we need progressive voters and progressive voices engaged in this election. I don‚Äôt want to see any excuses or disengagement if Bernie doesn‚Äôt move forward for whatever reason. That‚Äôs a big part of how we ended up with Trump in the first place.
I don‚Äôt know but I just saw a running total and Bernie has raised like 2x any other candidate overall.   Love that you self identify as a Bernie bro rather than getting uptight about it haha
It's just not how I--or Warren, clearly--want to win. Attacking someone's health when you can't possibly know who will live or who will die is just such a rude and shitty tactic. There's plenty of other reasons I find Warren to be a superior candidate and we should debate THOSE, not low-blow stuff like holding someone's involuntary heart attack against them!
A) this post was before we knew it was a heart attack  B) my grandfather who had a heart attack lived 15 years after it. My grandfather who didn‚Äôt died earlier. You cannot know when someone will die and pretending to know on an individual basis so you can promote your candidate is shitty.
!WarrenPlanBot is down right now, but you should be able to ask it questions about her positions on various things by typing its name, then a topic.
That‚Äôs fine, but Bernie is a great guy and we all wish him well. We‚Äôre ALL upset about 2016, but be cautious against fanning the flames of division, especially since we don‚Äôt always know who‚Äôs starting them.
You don't have to go out and fight for him, no. As your example illustrates, though, when we fight each other, we lose. If you'd rather not call out smears against him for his sake, that's fine. I think most Democrats look back to 2016 with pain and frustration, including the primary, and it's ok to still feel that. But when there's a call to quell disinformation and remain civil, you also don't have to say "but they didn't do that for us in 2016." You've rightly called out people who behaved badly in 2016. For the future of our party and country, let's focus on being better than they were in 2019 and 2020.
I just don‚Äôt think you can fight fire with fire. I‚Äôm frustrated by bad attacks from them as well but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should do the same back. It‚Äôll only drive people alway anyways. It‚Äôs what drove me away from Bernie‚Äôs camp and I don‚Äôt wanna recreate that in our own camp.
Stop trying to relitigate 2016 with Warren as a surrogate for Hillary and you'd probably be a lot happier in life.
This comment has been removed for violating Rule 4 (Dividing Democrats)
It wasn‚Äôt open heart surgery, it was a couple of stents. I had one and instantly felt better. The staff had to order me to stay in bed, I felt so good.
Yeah don't defend Bernie. Just rely on the facts
This is bullshit. I‚Äôm not pretending to have medical answers. The lies I‚Äôm defending him from are   A) he‚Äôs cancelling his campaign.  We can assume not cancelling his campaign until he says he is. It‚Äôs not a lie to say he hasn‚Äôt announced he is cancelling and we haven‚Äôt seen any indication he will. As of now, he‚Äôs not cancelling his campaign. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that‚Äù is the dumbest argument ever. You also don‚Äôt know that Warren isn‚Äôt cancelling her campaign because you can‚Äôt prove a negative. But we can safely assume she isn‚Äôt unless we hear otherwise.  B‚Äã) it was a serious, ‚Äúopen-heart‚Äù surgery.  The sensationalism happening around the procedure is out of hand. It was a quick procedure and minimally invasive. We don‚Äôt have Bernie‚Äôs medical records and that‚Äôs ok. But what we do know about the procedure is that it‚Äôs not such a huge deal and he made it through just fine.  C) he isn‚Äôt okay. Again we have no indication or reason not to believe the doctors who say he is okay. It‚Äôs not a lie to say there‚Äôs no reason to believe he isn‚Äôt okay now that the surgery is complete. He‚Äôs recovering from it, but there isn‚Äôt any reason to assume he will have further complications. Besides maybe if you wanted there to be.
Okay, so we can't say anything negative about Sanders, can't even wonder about his health when he has a health scare ... but fuck Biden is okay?  Hypocrisy
Biden sucks and also I‚Äôll vote for him if he‚Äôs the nominee.
While that would be nice, we‚Äôd also lose 2 seats in the senate...
I honestly can‚Äôt imagine either would be doing so well without the other. The message would get drowned out.
LOL, I was proven wrong in about a minute
The intention here isn‚Äôt to disparage Pete, but instead to talk about the way the media and people online talk about Warren:

She's literally earned every "elite" thing about her.    * She got teaching jobs at progressively more and more prestigious schools because she was considered a fantastic teacher.   * She was a world renowned bankruptcy law professor because she put out research that people recognized as excellent. * She chaired the TARP oversight committee because she'd demonstrated a keen eye for recognizing the banks' misdeeds. * She created a federal agency because she fought for it until the President of the United States was convinced it was a good and worthwhile idea. * She became a Senator because she inspired the people of Massachusetts to have her voice represent them. * And now she's a front-runner in the Democratic primary because she does her homework, puts out good detailed plans people want to see implemented, and puts in the work to listen to and connect with average people.  She didn't have a wealthy family or a fancy degree.  She didn't spend her entire career in politics.  She doesn't spend her time with wealthy donors.  She's an extremely smart woman who worked hard, overcame adversity, and then turned around to try to help fix the system that made her ascent such an uphill battle and continues to push down on working class families.
We need to stress her background as one that demonstrates the American Dream and how for many that is unattainable now.
Warren is the embodiment of the American Dream. This is why she polls so well with highly educated and financially successful demographics, they‚Äôre people who also ‚Äúmade it‚Äù...they‚Äôre people for whom the American Dream is still alive.
More accurate comparison is Joe Biden vs Warren coverage.  He's seen as  "of the people" when he's worked in politics and white collar all his life.
It's not just Warren. Booker is a Rhodes scholar, but no one talks about it, whereas it is the first thing that's mentioned in any article about Buttigieg.  Let him enjoy the media honeymoon. The inevitable breakup and divorce will be ugly.
Even better, let's stop obsessing over the biographical details of the candidates (e.g., whether they're "elites" or native American) and judge candidates on their policy commitments and theories of political change.
I see the point, but Buttigieg represents a midwestern city while Warren represents a state in New England. Buttigieg‚Äôs candidacy is also much more about appealing to moderates and the sorts of people who live in Indiana. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about background really, at least not that far back, but what kind of image a politician cultivates and who they tailor their message too.  I was talking to someone who is not conservative but comes from a fairly conservative and religious background. She likes Pete because she feels like he talks to her and her family in a way that seems to ‚Äúget‚Äù them and avoid coming across as condescending or a know-it-all while still disagreeing with them. That‚Äôs his whole schtick, which he developed as a liberal gay guy trying to be a politician in a place like Indiana. Warren‚Äôs thing is being a passionate proponent of her policy proposals. That‚Äôs pretty different from the folksy attitude that people are talking about. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better or worse, just different styles by different politicians who have focused on different constituencies.
As a Pete supporter first, I approve this message.
This is so accurate.
Because female.
I know Buttigieg has definitely marketed himself as the Midwesterner, whereas Warren hasn‚Äôt so much (to my knowledge) but I don‚Äôt see ‚Äúarea a candidate is from‚Äù as a reason to vote for or against them so long as they‚Äôre a decent person. It‚Äôs a crazy litmus test if people are trying to say one candidate is better than the other based on the geography of their childhood.   At this point I‚Äôll vote for anything that is breathing. Warren and Buttigieg are both my current top picks even though they‚Äôre vastly different candidates. I feel like they both have different strengths.
I‚Äôve got a different perspective as a Beto supporter. Welcome to our life. We do need to stay positive but this has to be pushed back on hard. The media has really started anointing Pete and they‚Äôll pound that narrative into the ground. Just look at Joe and Mika fawning over him.
I‚Äôm literally a supporter to both. I‚Äôve donated to both.   Both get pretty bad takes, especially from Bernie supporters.   We‚Äôd do fantastic with either Warren or Pete in the White House.
Unrelated to the substance of either candidates‚Äô policies, but ‚Äúwomen‚Äù is plural and ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is singular. If we‚Äôre talking about all women from Oklahoma who went to public school as single moms then it should be ‚Äúare‚Äù not ‚Äúis,‚Äù but if we‚Äôre talking about just Liz Warren it should be ‚Äúwoman‚Äù not ‚Äúwomen.‚Äù  I‚Äôll show myself out
woman*
Pete is called a mid-westerner, simply because he CURRENTLY lives in the Midwest. Warren has not lived in the Midwest for DECADES
When did "women" become a singular noun? I see this a lot online. What is the plural of "a women"?
Also, Pete is worth around $100k, Warren is worth around $14,000,000.
Of course he gets more Midwest cred. On the most basic level (where I suspect most voters still are and may stay), Liz is known as an East coast senator who talks about policies and money a lot and had something to do with "that CFPB thing". Pete is a mayor of a smallish town in Indiana. Doesn't get much more Midwestern than that.   Warren's Midwest ties are mostly in her past, Pete's are literally baked into his title - I'm not convinced it's really a media bias thing so much as an oversimplification.   On another note - how is this not an attack on Pete? "Upper middle class academic" makes college professor sound so menacing. Warren was a college professor, let's not pretend it's some strike against Pete for having a father with the same job as Liz.   I wish this sub would focus more on policy - where Warren excels - than on petty attacks on other candidates. A lot of people are undecided and it doesn't help if we disparage their #2s.
ehhh... she is running her campaign out of Boston with a lot of Harvard types while he's staying in Indiana.  I get the point- she's my candidate- but I wouldn't slag on Pete for that perception.
How could you claim this isn't meant to disparage Pete.
I think Warren is an incredible academic and I admire her very much as a legislator.   That said, I think when we rip other candidates apart, all we are doing is handing the Republicans their talking points.   That‚Äôs a quick route to losing the election.   Stay positive about all the candidates‚Äî-almost any of them would be really fine leaders!
And let's not forget Pete dines with the real elites while Warren is out answering questions and shaking hands.   And Biden takes their money while getting to be 'the working-class moderate.'  And Bernie takes their money while getting to be 'the progressive.' He also gets to be the economic policy candidate, despite the fact that he only has a BA in poli-sci and a lifelong political career, while she was a tenured professor teaching and researching law and economics for years before ever entering politics.   It's hard to tell if this is because of the lobby against her or just because this country hates women, but the truth is she's better at everything people like the other candidates for.
Nah let‚Äôs disparage Pete
I don't think OK really counts as midwest, more like Texas Minor
I'll be happy to disparage Buttigieg. Not for his upbringing but for his about face on Medicare for All as soon as the checks from Big Pharma & Big Insurance cashed. He's corrupt. A made man. Bought and paid for. Why would \_anyone\_ vote for him knowing that?
they will go to incredible lengths to argue that it isn't because she is a woman.
What is her point? Pete gets the exact same accusations of being elite and uppity as a gay man. How convenient of the user to completely erase the incredibleness of it.     Personal attacks are disgusting and beneath Democrats.

Ugh, you‚Äôre not going to win anyone over with these grievances.
Most of Pete‚Äôs popularity is thanks to the fact that he‚Äôs been able to convince people that he‚Äôs a small town everyday American just because he‚Äôs a formerly unknown mayor of a small midwestern city who‚Äôs open about his christianity. Everyday Americans didn‚Äôt go to Harvard.
I mean, to be fair, Pete is currently from the Midwest. Elizabeth Warren is not.
I dont think "Pete is the son of an academic"  considering Warren is an former professor.
I just watched a media clip of someone saying ‚Äúyou better prepare your attacks because he [Buttigieg] will turn them right back on you.‚Äù  First of all, this is a Warren characteristic way more than it‚Äôs a Buttigieg one - he still hasn‚Äôt answered for some of his actions in South Bend.  Secondly along those same lines, the quote makes it sound like there are no *possible* valid criticisms of Buttigieg to be made when there clearly are.
Not that Warren's tale isn't heroic enough but was she really a single mom?  According to her wikipedia entry she graduated law school in 1976 and divorced in 1978.

They are both elite pmcs
Wow. All janitors are assumed to be dirt poor, and their children cripplingly disadvantaged? Bit of a leap here...
people call her elite, but she leans into her background everytime on the stump. I feel like media coverage isn't accurate to what people see from her. She signals her background and how hard she fought for it.
The whole point of this country is that you're supposed to work hard and become successful and then when you do you're an 'elitist'
Exactly. Liz Warren embodies the things that this country should be rewarding.
She's also had 30 more years to accomplish these things. If 37 year old Liz was running for president they would laugh at her for having no experience.
You know, I'm very much Team Warren and I didn't realized she chaired the TARP oversight committee. Cool!
I'm a rabid Warren supporter. That said, let's walk back that "wealthy donor" statement. An inevitability of campaigning nationally is meeting with wealthy donors, which her campaign has. Her personally? Maybe not so much. But she directs her campaign to do this and I'm sure communicates with these donors. There's nothing wrong with that. It takes a billion dollars to win the Office. We have to be real about this.
Some people resent financial success on the left. Nothing about their attitude is sustainable nor will it appeal to general election voters.

I think it definitely works. I explained her background to my mom and she is still undecided but she said that she is considering voting for Warren because she thinks it‚Äôs amazing that she was a professor/teacher.
One person I talked to really opened up to Elizabeth Warren after I mentioned that she'd dropped out of college at one point, because she got married. Warren wasn't this perfect robot. She's a human being who figured her way through growing up like all of us have to.
That‚Äôs basically the premise of A Fighting Chance
the American Dream died with Nixon, as Hunter Thompson describes. And as George Carlin quips, the reason it's called The American Dream is because you only believe it when you're asleep. The whole point of Warren's ascendancy is to make a new American Dream that isn't hollow like the old one.
It wasn't available then either, for large swathes of the population
Yeah but at least Biden has the resume to deserve to be on the same stage
Yep -- [In 2019, there were 596 mentions of Pete's Rhodes scholarship compared to 79 for Booker.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/buttigieg-booker-rhodes-scholar_n_5dcf18ebe4b0d2e79f8cb305)
Yes.  It's also funny to hear Buttigieg fans say that executive experience is more important, when Booker has the same amount of experience as mayor, he just went on and gained experience as a Senator after.  I have a dark view that inexperience is actually a positive because you can claim whatever you want, and if you have a touch of charisma people only look positively on your potential.  The debate hosts should be grilling the candidates in a way that really makes people like Buttigieg, Yang, and Steyer sweat about the effect of their inexperience while also holding more experienced candidates to their records, but I guess that left when the League of Women Voters was kicked out of hosting.
When you dive into Mayor Pete's resume, outside his military experience, you find you can get the same or better with a lot of other candidates, including Warren.   You think it is great that Mayor Pete went to Harvard? It is impressive, then again, Warren taught there.   Being a Mayor is more executive experience than being a Senator? Okay, Booker, Castro, De Blassio, Bernie, and Bloomberg were mayors. Newark, San Antonio, and New York are much harder to manage than South Bend. In fact, Castro has actually worked in the US executive branch. So has Biden, if you were politically conscious during the Obama administration.   In the end, bringing up Mayor Pete's experience only serves to show that he might be ready. It is a thinly veiled justification that has little to do with why they actually support him.
I thought that was true the first wave we saw of him. Was proud how quickly we got over it‚Äîuntil it happened again.
I get your point but the media did the same thing for Trump and he got loads of eyeballs watching his stump speeches (such as they are) for free.
Because Pete is relatively new in national politics & still introducing himself, hence why he gets introduced as a Rhodes Scholar. Booker has been around for years & is a US Senator. This is a ridiculous point.
It truly is representative of the legacy of white patriarchal supremacy that Buttigieg is taken so seriously and being boosted by the media when he is the least qualified person running. He absolutely must have some close friends high up at NBC/CNN/ect as it makes zero sense that he was given so much media attention to begin with.  Maybe it's possible that certain threads of party/media leadership wanted to nock progressives down a peg and the only way to do so was to find a candidate with a completely blank slate, but either way, it's honestly disgusting to watch so many incredibly qualified candidates be pushed aside to boost Pete's media time.
[removed]
>I see the point, but Buttigieg represents a midwestern city while Warren represents a state in New England.   This is a bit of a tangent, but as a New Englander, it pisses me off that no matter what we can never considered "real Americans". We have great universities and Boston's a well-off city, yes, but we also have rural areas, hardscrabble postindustrial towns, plenty of working class people. We aren't all Ivy Tower elites, but the media insists we are.
Indiana isn't moderate, though. It's by far the reddest state in the Midwest (I count the Plains as a separate region, since they have little in common geographically, economically, culturally, or historically). Obama winning it by just barely 1% in 2008 was a political upset on par with the Civil War in terms of how unprecedented it was, and how unlikely it is to ever happen again. Alaska and South Carolina, by partisan lean, will turn blue long before Indiana does. Due to the ongoing brain drain from the Midwest to the South, Indiana is only getting redder and redder, while Georgia, Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina are turning into swing states due to the influx of former residents of Indiana and states like it. A blue Indiana means Democrats already had a Reagan-like Electoral College blowout anyway. Pete will almost certainly win Iowa where Clinton couldn't, and he might run up the popular vote score in the Indianapolis suburbs without actually carrying Indiana, but so will most of the other candidates.
i'm having a hard time w/ the premise of the OP's post, though i see some of the points as well. The pete campaign hasn't been signaling the midwest thing that hard (he points it out sure but as a consensus candidate thing). They did a lot more of his elite pedigree as to add to his credibility at the beginning though. Part of the reason why I think (besides racism) Booker isn't as associated with Rhodes scholar thing is that Buttigieg campaign signaled it a lot more to media.   To you last point, I think Warren connects, the issue is most people don't pay attention directly to her and the coverage on her is sexist in the tone. I think Iowans are keyed into politics more, and her rise is there was b/c those keyed in people see her relatability to people's everyday needs.
Literally it.
The point here wasn‚Äôt that Warren needs a ‚ÄúMidwestern‚Äù label.
If you just google Pete, there‚Äôs about 5-7 puff pieces even though he is now a frontrunner. But if you google Liz, almost all pieces are negative because she‚Äôs a frontrunner.  Edit: Let‚Äôs also focus that it is the white MSM that is anointing Pete even though he is polling at ZERO % with black voters in S.C.
The media and Zuckerberg, who seems to have introduced Pete to all the people with money in the valley at private fundraisers.
I came here to say this, so, please - let yourself back in.
ok elitist       ^^/s
It‚Äôs not about why Warren isn‚Äôt called a Midwesterner. It‚Äôs about why he gets called folksy and gets softballs from the media while Warren gets reamed and called elitist because she currently is doing well and lives in the east.
The Warrens' (as a couple) are worth $12M. Your point is...?
Elitism is the opposite of populism. It has little to do with net worth and more to do with how you think the country should operate: Run by the wealthy and academics or run more democratically. Warren is not an elitist, and this is precisely because she didn‚Äôt grow up in wealth or academia or elitist subgroups.
This isn‚Äôt attacking either of their attributes which can be considered high-brow. There‚Äôs no malice in the words ‚Äúupper middle class academic.‚Äù It‚Äôs just pointing out the disingenuous approach in the MSM that‚Äôs adopted towards Pete relative to Warren. No one here hates college professors, our candidate is a former one herself and we love it. If people take it as an attack on Pete, that‚Äôs just ridiculous.
There are no ‚Äúupper middle class academics‚Äù who don‚Äôt teach in professional schools.   Buttigieg‚Äôs parents were professors of English.   The pay is shit‚Äî-middle class, but barely.   (Source: am professor)
Disparage? It‚Äôs like you didn‚Äôt read it at all. Nobody said it was a strike against Pete to have educated parents.
Also, Oklahoma isn't a Midwest state either. I don't recall Liz's full bio, but she didn't grow up in a Midwest state and doesn't represent one in government.  Side note, part of what Pete says as well, is that there is a brain drain from the Midwest states, to the coasts. That part of our problem is that people are abandoning Midwest states for the coast.
I don‚Äôt know how many times I gotta say it: Neither this tweet nor my post is slagging on Pete. Where do you see that?
As explained in the title, it's a discussion of media coverage.
Because it‚Äôs not? Lmao. This doesn‚Äôt remotely insult Pete or his candidacy in any way (though there‚Äôs disparity with Warren in that too). It just points out the disingenuous portrayal of the two in MSM.
How could you claim it disparages Pete?
How is it remotely disparaging?
i'm gonna agree, most media coverage i've seen on him doesn't do much to higlight he's salt of the earth blahblahblah. I actually think he should lean into that more.
it‚Äôs like you didn‚Äôt read the title at all or even the tweet. nobody said anything negative about Pete.
Okay but what if you think (1) it will be easy for the right to come at Biden or Buttiegeg in the general anyway and (2) neither of those guys would be in any way a fine leader, except they happen to not be Trump?
Agreed. Can't they both be inspirational people with engaging life stories?
Ok Arkansas
Show me the attack? Quote the exact words you think are an attack on any candidate.
Removed: Rule 8
Don't know why you're down voted. You're spot on.
Yup.
Do you stop being a mother when you get a law degree?  Her son was 2 when her and her first husband got divorced.
There is a singular ‚Äúmedia‚Äù that shares a common opinion?  Every single journalist and editor?   This is a ridiculous oversimplification.
It seems as if warren supports forgot about the MONTHS of glowing coverage. Come on, wake up
"Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services"?
who‚Äôs making a leap? oh, right, you are! bye troll
What she is trying to show in her campaign is that she is a deserving member of the elite, without having become an elitist. Every candidate on that stage is an elite, just by virtue of being deemed important enough to be considered for the nomination. Many are millionaires, many have wrote best selling books, most live in wealthy cities. I don't think voters hold that against them.  Voters *do* hold elitism against candidates, however. That's why almost every candidate emphasizes their everyman/everywoman appeal ie being from a small town, coming from a poor family, etc. It's the "do I want to have a beer with them" factor.   Warren emphasizing her upbringing, her young adult life, and how hard she had to work to get where she is demonstrates her everywoman quality. Warren taking selfies with every person who wants one shows that she cares about the things normal people care about (which is, sadly, the likes they get on Instagram). But Warren highlighting her work in law, her books, the CFBP, her work in the Senate, etc gives credibility to her elite stature, and presumes that voters want an elite to run the country (we do).
We didn't win, but Liz delivered on fighting corruption.
What‚Äôs the original picture about?   Also lol Bloomberg
I guess if I can take anything positive from yesterday it's this. Fucking Bloomberg.
Bloomberg is eating the most expensive *crow for dinner* in history.
If nothing else, Warren single-handedly saved us from a new normal where billionaires routinely buy elections and democracy grows ever further from the people. Even if this is the end, she's already saved America once.
I'm not thrilled about the idea of Biden winning the nomination, but I would have been absolutely devastated if Bloomberg won it. I really think it would have started a new era of people literally buying their way into government.  Fortunately, it looks like all the money in the world can't make up for a complete lack of political skill.
At least I don‚Äôt have to see annoying ads on TV & YouTube about Mike Bloomberg again
Liz is one of the best political athletes in the game.   She has done a public service for dems and progressives everywhere.
She was the one that went hardest against him. So much respect to Warren. If he would have surged past Biden that would have been terrifying and Warren did so much to reveal who he is.
Not trying to brigade but just wanted to say she did amazing at destroying him! It was a public service from a true public servant.   Anyone Not On The Epstein Flight Logs 2020
Best part of yesterday!  So disappointed she didn‚Äôt do better, I was holding a sliver of hope. If Biden wins the nom, he needs to pick a strong progressive VP, given how split the party is.
Yeah she fucking bodied him.  It was glorious.
She's the only one who knows how to take these people down.
She went after him for his mistreatment of women specifically, more than for corruption. It's interesting to me that those attacks were so effective, but we're still unlikely to elect a woman president any time soon.
I can‚Äôt believe she got Bloomberg to drop out and America repays her by not voting for her. üò° Thanks America, you proved tonight that you always want the choice for president to be down to 2 old men.
And that's how you  slay the dragon!  Elizabeth Warren, the very definition of True Grit!
Hate that the Bernie supporters on social media are blaming Warren for Biden when this idiot Bloomberg was trying to buy his way into the election.
I love it
Bloomberg dropping out is bad news for Liz.  Now the progressive vote is split and the moderate vote is united behind Biden.    And there‚Äôs like zero chance Bernie will drop out.   This fucking sucks. My heart is hurting for Liz now. I‚Äôve wanted her to be president for so long.
honestly, i'm super proud of liz. it was a historic campaign! she wasn't a fake corporate candidate just using identity politics, she was a genuine real hard progressive (still is of course)  honestly, i was hoping and thinking she was going to win for a long time. i 100% blame the advisors she was surrounded with who tried to push her in a direction she wasn't comfortable with :\ look at the polls, as soon as she started listening to their advice, she dropped real quick  all in all, you did great lizzie, super proud! i'm 100% sure you'll be president some day!
Hahaha yaaaaas
Murdered a man live on the air
I'm glad this is the narrative, but really, Mike Bloomberg won.  He got exactly what he wanted, and he got exactly what he paid for: Warren gone.  We giggle about the money he "spent" but he doesn't care about that money.  I really hope this cost him some reputation too.  More Americans know that he's an evil man now.  But he will spend the rest of his life surrounded by fellow billionaires who will call him a hero.
itt bernie folks brigading being toxic. good outreach! much praxis.
Democrats have got to make up their minds if they want their candidate to be Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Once they have done that then they can work on defeating the real corrupt criminal Trump.
It was an AMAZING take-down. Unfortunately, I think she also had caught some negative effects from it as well. Many people in this country do not like it when they see a woman embarrass a man like that. Even if they agree with her. Assertive women cannot win with an old electorate.
I see only one and I mean only one chance at Biden not winning and that's Warren and Bernie double teaming Biden in the debates until he looks like a joke and people switch votes.
[removed]
I will bleed for Bernie but I have to give Liz major props, her taking out Mike was by far the best thing that could've happened to our country. That piece of shit was nothing but a more intelligent version of Donald Trump and now he will never ever be president.
I am a Bernie supporter, but the Naysayers in here I have a question? Did you not watch the debates? She consistently put Bloomberg in a hurt locker period end of story.
Hell  yeah she did! Nevada debate was the thing that broke his campaign (not money wise, obviously).
It was over the first time she called him out in Nevada. Instant 20 point drop. Beautiful stuff. I wonder if she will manage to eat Biden at the next debate.
Bloomberg got exactly what he wanted, in contributing to knocking two progressives out of the race via Super Tuesday. It‚Äôs nice we won‚Äôt have to see him on the debate stage anymore, but he isn‚Äôt going anywhere, unfortunately. He will continue donating to and having a corrupt influence on the DNC.
It's 1 am and I laughed really loud at this. Love it! Disappointed that Liz is doing poorly in the primary, but at least she took Bloomberg out with her? I'm fine with Biden even if he isn't my first choice, but I don't even know what I would've done if Bloomberg became the nominee.
Elizabeth Warren is the only effective public servant running in the race. Her real-time routing of corruption should've propelled her into a big victory yesterday, and yet...
I don't think anyone else in the world ever brutally savaged a billionaire so bad
He's with ridin' with biden now, remember that.
   Warren needs to stay in. It's now 2v1 versus Biden. I think the establishment made a big mistake by going all in right now. Warren can continue to rack up some delegates to go with Bernie, who can probably get 40% going forward. If Liz can get 11%, then they can pool them together.  They can 2v1 Biden at the debate on March 15 . Also looking like Tulsi will be in the next debate. They can take the progressive movement together. That's the only path forward for the progressive wing of the party.
She really got there in a flash like an arrow!
Yessss I love this!
Her taking down bloomberg was great, no doubt. But when the chips were down she took the super pac money.

Its a behind the scenes shot from the last episode of Arrow. Its Grant Gustin goofing around in front of Oliver Queen (DC character "Arrow")'s grave. Definitely not from a real funeral.
Here's another silver lining from yesterday: Voter turnout surged! It was way higher than 2016 in most states. This bodes well for Democrats in November!  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/4/21164518/super-tuesday-results-voter-turnout
The fact that yesterday I got to vote for the woman who would make the best president in a generation was a huge positive.  When I went into the voting booth I looked at all the names and took a second to really soak it in (candidates who dropped out a long time ago still had their names on the ballot). Not that long ago, around the time when I cast my very first vote, the idea of seeing this calibre and diversity of a roster would've been unthinkable. It felt like a really important moment in our history. Voting for Warren knowing that she was the best person on that very well qualified list made me so happy.  Of course I wish other people saw things the way I did. I wish people paid less attention to polls, stopped trying to guess who was electable, and were less skeptical of people who are experts at what they do. But, regardless of what Warren decides to do in this race, she'll play a huge role in shaping the platform. That alone is worth feeling positive about.
Not relative to his net worth, unfortunately.
look up the difference between a million seconds and a billion seconds, and then recognize he has 55 of those billions.  The money he spent to wave his dick around literally amounts to pocket change for you and I.
Probably Ortolan Bunting to wash it down.
I still can't believe the SC debate audience booed her.
As usual a woman does the hard background work to open a path for the men to succeed. Classic.
Dude shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to bend the rules and run . Smh he took a lot of the vote count
Hopefully Bezos, Zuck, Jack and all those tech bros are scared away.
It's unfortunate that Bloomberg turned right around and gave his endorsement(And likely a sizable check) to Biden. Which should come as no surprise, seeing as Biden is massively against any sort of wealth tax or attempt to go after the wealthy the same way that Senator Warren is. If liz throws in the towel and leaves us with either the toxicity of the Sanders campaign or the most middle of the road candidate that the DNC could find, I'll probably stay home.
[removed]
What if he spent all of the rest of his money on ads just to annoy everyone?
She also went after his racist record as well.
She may win the nomination in 2024 or 2028. She has plenty of time left to run for pres, whereas Sanders will likely retire.
I'm really disappointed that my state, Colorado, only got her one delegate while Bloomberg got 9. He only had a few percent more voters than she did. I think a lot of otherwise Warren voters ended up voting for Bernie instead.
They never see the forest, just the trees.
She'll have another chance, she's not that old.
What does John Delaney have to do with this?
He wanted Bernie gone. That‚Äôs why he ran. He only succeeded in wasting damn near 600m
Last night people there were calling Elizabeth Warren a bitch for staying in through Super Tuesday. Definitely one of the worst places on Reddit.
Their subreddit is vocally saying the problem was they weren't angry and aggressive enough with other candidates and supporters and they need to be even more combative to win the election.   It's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see how it plays out.
They're fresh out of the Ben Mora School of Political Persuasion.
[removed]
So...she stays in until at least March 15th, eviscerates Biden, and then mic drops/peace outs? That‚Äôd be epic.
Sanders doesn‚Äôt deserve her support
[removed]
I think one of the best take-aways from super Tuesday was that Bloomberg spent nearly $600 million to get 4 delegates from American Samoa.
I'm just afraid that the 3 most progressive candidates are forced to share votes while Biden stands alone. Biden just feels like Hillary 2. Poised to lose the general election
She should stay in until the next debate, where she can do to Biden what she did to Bloomberg.  Her fight's not done yet, even if she's not fighting for her own nomination any longer.
I hope Sanders and Warren team up. That would be beautiful. Oh, but no way the DNC let's Tulsi in any more debates.
Our Revolution won't be disclosing its donors until the end of the year, if ever.      Say what you want about PACs and I think they shouldn't exist, but neither should dark money 501 groups, even for candidates and causes I like.
Pro tip: putting down your opponents' candidates is a horrible way to persuade them to support your favorite.
Pro tip: putting down your opponents' candidates and insulting them personally is a horrible way to persuade them to support your favorite.
Bernie had PAC and SuperPAC support for months before Warren accepted PersistPAC.  Super Tuesday just shows that money can‚Äôt buy elections, not even for progressives.
Sure, but this meme is about her single-handedly destroying him when no one else could or did.
I donated a larger percentage of my net worth to Warren than he spent on his campaign and that's goddamn infuriating.   Though if we count student debt my net worth is negative so...
It was $1700-3500 to attend the debate. There wasn‚Äôt a single Warren or Bernie supporter in that audience. I‚Äôm sure Bloomberg paid the way in for more than a few of his team.
Audience of almost entirely Biden and Boomerberg supports if you ignore the campaign staff seats. Maybe some of Steyer's friends too.
:(  Warren never got a fair shot. I really wonder what the race would look like if Bernie didn't run again and decided to get behind her from the beginning. (And I'm a Pete supporter, so I'm not just saying that because I like Senator Warren, which I do.)
Yeah, unless something radically changes I'll be sitting out the rest of the primary too. But everyone needs to vote blue no matter who in the general election.
Yeah that's why I chose Warren over Bernie. The movement Bernie has created has just become too toxic for me to even consider it. He has had opportunities to disavow some of his supporters and what he's said during those opportunities was sub par for me.      I would never dream of staying home, but it'll take a lot of convincing for me to not just leave the top of the ticket blank. So far Bernie supporters and Biden supporters have not even been going about it in the right way.
Biden isn't even middle of the road. He is farther right than Hillary ever was. His voting record is horrible. He would lose in a catastrophic landslide to Donald Trump if it were 2016 instead of the softer loss Hillary gave us. The DNC almost may as well give the nomination to Mitt Romney.
Pro tip: being combative and putting down your opponents' candidates is a horrible way to persuade them to support your favorite.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple.
Fellow Coloradan and totally agree
A Biden versus Trump general could mean another four years of Trump.
Warren should‚Äôve been more aggressive with Bernie in that last debate. Bloomberg wasn‚Äôt her competition, sanders was.
What‚Äôs done?
[removed]
[removed]
You would rather nominate someone who voted for everything the Bush era Republicans did to fuck this country? And someone who will fall apart like wet paper in the general to give us Trump?
Why are people saying she is going to endorse Biden and has taken super pac money and is going to trash Sanders? Im confused.
OK, lemme get this straight. If @ewarren 's wealth tax had been in place from 1982, Bezos would still have $49B, Gates $14B, Bloomberg $12B And we'd ALL have child care & health care. Student debt relief. 4X more Fed $ for public schools. Can we vote now?
I don't know how I'd get by with $12B. That's not even enough to buy an African country!
It's been said before but I'll say it again...  If someone with $1 million were to spend $100,000 a day, they'd run out of money in 10 days.  If someone with $1 billion were to spend $100,000 a day, they'd run out of money in 27 years.  If Jeff Bezos, with ~$100 billion, were to spend $100,000 a day, he'd run out of money in 2739 years. Since the Neo-Assyrian Empire was the largest empire in the world, Jeff Bezos could have spent $100,000 **every single day** and just run out now.  This analogy seems like the best way to convince people of just how crazy that amount of money is.
And Trump would still be bankrupt.
I tend to be on the side of the entrepreneurial spirit and letting people who come up with great ideas and/or build great companies enjoy the best things that we are able to make...yachts, supercars, mansions, whatever.    I guess I'm not really a Socialist. Much.    That said. A billion dollars is an absurd amount of money for one person to have. Nobody needs that much money. If a company or person, or whatever is generating that kind of wealth, it needs to be taxed for the greater good. A progressive tax.     And, I'm sorry, if Warren's plan would leave them with that much wealth, it's not enough.      Just imagine what kind of society we could have if all of those resources were put into science, R&D, medicine, infrastructure, whatever, instead of sitting in banks. Just imagine.    Edit- couple words
This is an excellent that needs to get a bigger microphone.
even if we had taxed bill gates at the misleading rate that interview via tweet suggested, he'd still have billions!  jdsal;fkjsadl;fjdaslfjsadklfjsklf
We'd also be well on our way to Single-Payer if we are talking the 6% rate.   That also ignores the fact that none of these people have their money managed by idiots and would have investments that would keep their wealth well above these numbers.   The Wealth Tax is not meant to be punitive to the wealthy. It is just a way for them to give back to the system that made their success possible.
No more Billionaires.
Holy fuck the sowing doubt trolls in that twitter thread.
I'm a very progressive liberal and I'm on the fence when it comes to the wealth tax. Can anyone please explain how you prevent expatriation of wealth?
Isn't Warren taking the stance that billionaires should not exist? Or is that just Bernie? Surely we can't just tax it away, but does she have any plans to keep Bezos at least under $5 Billion if she could start in 1982?
But even though I‚Äôm making $35k a year, I might win the lottery some day. I don‚Äôt want to be taxed like that, so I‚Äôm voting Republican. /s
but if i might be a billionaire one day I better make sure that the money I forget I have and could never spend doesn't go to a \*checks notes\* family in need
And all of those numbers are still unnecessary amounts of money.
It's not like Warren's plan taxes 95 percent of the Billionaires' wealth. They're still left with a sizable amount of change. I don't feel bad for them.
ü§£And if Sanders plans had been approved back in the day imagine how much better things would be.  Never too late to right a wrong!
just wait till you hear what a VAT tax would do
Lol.. Every billionaire in the country together would pay for the current US budget for about 3 years and these morons think an unconstitutional wealth tax of a few percent will pay for all that? I despair of low IQ voters.
Wealth taxes wouldn‚Äôt generate much at all from the wealthy. It‚Äôs way to easy to route money around so that the federal government can‚Äôt see it making it impossible for the feds to calculate a proper tax rate.  Also, most of those billions that you talk about aren‚Äôt just sitting around doing nothing. Rich people didn‚Äôt get that rich by being stupid and doing nothing with their money. Plenty of it gets invested into stocks in small businesses which helps fund people having trouble getting their own companies started up, and in the case of Bill gates much of his wealth goes into the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation which is dedicated to spending money in order to solve world crisis such as clean water in developing countries, research into carbon free energy, and a crazy amount of education grants to try and help combat how student loans have hyper-inflated the price of college.   It‚Äôs easy to see that much money in one place and immediately think it‚Äôs wrong and to take most of it all. The problem is that once you actually think about it, that money is far better in the hands of someone who can smartly spend it all to effectively better the world than the government. The government can‚Äôt agree on much of anything so most of that money will likely go into funding the military. Furthermore they spend billions of dollars on small programs and research that have no real world impact or importance: like having shrimp running on treadmills for science that was actually funded with millions of taxpayer dollars.   I also noticed that in your post you claimed we would ALL have student debt relief. So I‚Äôm going to make some counter arguments to that.   1) That may be true at the current rate, however college tuition has been getting more expensive due to student loans paying the college up-front. There is no incentive whatsoever for the college to charge less money because the government will immediately pay for it all in its entirety. Taking a wealth tax (let‚Äôs propose this does in fact work) would also take money out of the pocket of school faculty and people on the board, which will only incentivize them to charge even higher tuition rates in order to get back to the same level of returns, and because once again the government pays it all up-front student debt would actually skyrocket.   2) If students put no money on the table at all,   college graduation rates would plummet, and the requirements to get in would be unreasonably high. As a college student myself it‚Äôs very easy to fall into the same lazy pattern that accompanied me and millions of other Americans in HighSchool. However with actual money in the table for me (its about 1K a semester for me since I‚Äôm doing CC) theres more of a reason for me not to fail. Because I know I can‚Äôt get that money back and I need to make the most of it. I agree that tuition needs to get cheaper but a wealth tax would inevitably do the opposite once you take in market factors and not just numerical data.  3) The heavy focus on college in the modern age  has been incredibly unhealthy, most of the        degrees that colleges offer have no use in the real world at all. It‚Äôs becoming even more sad that trade school are getting thrown under the bus. We need jobs like HVAC repair, plumbers, pilots and the list goes on. Plenty of these trade jobs also pay far better than most college degree careers so that‚Äôs a huge plus. However, since college is so heavily focused on, were looking at leas than %1 of HS grads actually going to trade school. This is bad because college is not for everyone and it‚Äôs only made apparent with the enormous amounts of students that fail and drop before making it to graduation.
Delusion!
Her debt relief plan doesn't adequately take professional degrees (high debt, high salary) into account

I got bored and googled the gdp of small countries.   The GDP of Nicaragua is apparently 13.8 billion.   So Bill Gates commands enough money to rival *the entire economic activity of a small country*. So I suspect they do actually have enough to buy a small country.
I think everyone voting for any of the democratic nominees see people like Lee Cooperman the whole banking insiders as the ultimate "OK Boomers". We all agree they need to be the taxed more. The issue within the Dem candidates is the logistics of the wealth tax. Compliance is simply too big a problem.  &#x200B;  >Back in 1990, around a dozen European countries had a wealth tax, [according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV).

Now, now, before we feel too bad for your $1 billionaire: If she invests her $1 billion in the stock market and achieves the historical average 7% return on investment, she can up her spending to a cool $190,000/day and never lose a dime...
Like... morally?
Exactly, I have no problem with people being rich, that is going to happen.  But the money needs to flow through the system, not be hoarded at the top.  Look at every revolution in history, the stage is always set by circumstances of inequality that we are seeing now.  Either the upper class learns to give up something back to society or they might end up losing it all to some socialist/communist takeover.

Babysteps. Let's introduce an 80% tax rate or whatever before we're introducing a 99% or 100% tax rate.  There's also the aspect where if it was impossible to be a billionaire then companies would grow a certain amount and then just kind of stop growing once someone got their money. Or some incredibly intelligent person and great businessman that made a billion dollars at a young age would just retire. Would Bill Gates retiring at 31 in 87 be a good thing? Or Steve Jobs retiring in 95?   Not to mention that if they do retire at that point then they don't ever get that money so that it can be taxed. So you're not actually bringing in any more money and instead just styming economic growth. I don't buy the Republican idea of small increases in tax would make them not want to make money, but if you do a 99% or 100% tax then they obviously would have no reason to want to make that money anymore.  I agree that the tax could be a bit higher but it should be done in a way that is best for society and with economic studies done to determine the best rate.   Warren's a capitalist for a reason and so am I. We need big structural change, not to burn the whole system down.
If it didn‚Äôt leave them with that much they‚Äôd make sure it never happened. *Edited a typo
Another way to look at it, it‚Äôs a tax for not paying your employees enough. If your making that much money your clearly taking advantage of the thousands of employees it took to earn that money.
I‚Äôm with you‚Äîa hard cap is a poor incentive. I just think 99% of wealth over $1B should be taxed away.
Dave Chappelle explained in pretty well with his anecdote:  >There‚Äôs not too many people that don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm crazy. So I look at it like this: I‚Äôm at a restaurant with my wife. It‚Äôs a nice restaurant. We‚Äôre eating dinner. I look across the room and I say, ‚ÄòYou see this guy over here across the room? He has $100 million. And we‚Äôre eating the same entree. So, OK, fine, I don‚Äôt have $50 million or whatever it was, but say I have $10 million in the bank. The difference in lifestyle is minuscule. The only difference between having $10 million and $50 million is an astounding $40 million ‚Ä¶Of course I would like to have that money.‚Äù

Well, America has more leverage for enforcement than the European countries where wealth taxes failed. It‚Äôs easier to move from Italy to Switzerland than it is to move from America to anywhere.   That‚Äôs really all I‚Äôve got. Warren proposed an exit tax on assets of people trying to their wealth get out of the country, but they‚Äôd just do it before the bill passed. Especially since it is dubious whether or not it‚Äôs constitutional, that would tie things up in court.
Especially since these numbers are tied up in corporate stocks. Forcing Bezos to sell stocks to pay the tax puts Russia, China, etc in control of Amazon
Only Bernie has said that.
When we are talking about literal wealth distribution, saying we are only doing it to take 90% of Bezos's wealth, and not 99%,and that isn't good enough, is, I think, a foolish stance.   A wealth tax is already a very big step. Enormous. Tempering it, a little, to make it palatable, is very reasonable.
Bezos' wealth came pretty recently with the explosive growth of Amazon, which is why he would still be so wealthy. The one weird thing that I don't know how to work out is taxing those who are just billionaires on paper, especially if the company isn't even profitable yet. Although maybe a wealth tax would also keep a lid on such absurd valuations in the first place.
Warren's plan is to break up Amazon and that's for the benefit of society. I don't care about Jeff Bezos and don't think she should waste her time on formulating some plan to stop him from crossing an arbitrary line you made.
What would a VAT tax do?
Warren's wealth tax is predicted to generate $2.75T over 10 years or **$275B/year.** This is assuming full compliance by the wealthy. Europe has found compliance is a huge issue because the wealthy aren't interested in reporting every dollar they have just so they can pay a fee for it. Hence why European countries cancelled the tax.  A VAT at 5% applied broadly would generate $2.97T over 9 years or $330B/yr. Yang is proposing a 10% VAT. So assuming around a **$660B/yr** revenue, Yang's VAT tax would generate 2.5x Warren's wealth tax a year. And that's assuming full compliance on the wealth tax.

>I don't need . . . healthcare  Have fun dying painfully along with your children then, I guess?  Everyone needs it at some point, and it's not all about you anyway.  You and your children are more likely to need healthcare than they are to need a billionaire is all I'm saying.
Hey, Larry Ellison bought the sixth largest Hawaiian island of Lanai for only $300 million, so totally doable.
You can't compare market cap to GDP. That's like comparing meters to seconds. Doesn't make any sense at all. Completely different units.
That's not how GDP works
["Warren argues her proposal learns from the failures in Europe. She told us in an email, quote, "I specifically designed this proposal to account for lessons learned from wealth taxes in other countries," unquote. Unlike in the European Union, it's hard for Americans to freely move to another country or state and escape national taxes. On top of that, the Warren plan imposes an exit tax, which would confiscate 40 percent of a person's wealth over $50 million if they renounce their citizenship.... It's only for people who have more than $50 million in wealth - ultra-wealthy individuals..... In Europe, the tax affected a much bigger percentage of the population. Zucman believes that helped the rich lobby for all sorts of exemptions on business assets and pensions and artwork. It made for a leaky bucket.](https://www.npr.org/2019/03/01/699261950/why-a-wealth-tax-didnt-work-in-europe)
Why is it that anytime here someone claims the wealth tax isn't feasible, they're always Yang people?   Why is it that Yang is so opposed to even trying a wealth tax? Worried it hurts his Silicon Valley buddies too much because it is possible to implement even though you claim it isn't?  And seriously? Citing Cato? The people opposed to any tax is your argument for fighting liberal policy? Cato wouldn't admit a liberal tax idea worked no matter the evidence because they are full on trickle down bullshit artists.  How the fuck do you make a supposed argument for liberal policy using the source of worst of destructive conservative fiscal policy?   And what is with refusing to try? Why should your argument be better when you refuse to even try? Why is that good?

Man I was just on r/unpopularopinion arguing if you have more than what you need you should give, and literally every single comment was saying I was arguing that everyone should have the same wealth and didn't want rich people. Even when I specifically specified qualifications and caveats in the description.
I can't think of any examples where they learned to give back
There was an economic study recently (I can‚Äôt remember where I saw it). Basically, billionaires on average got 2/3 of their wealth through something of value, and 1/3 through rent seeking.
I think we mostly agree in the premise of what can be afforded, but I totally disagree on some of the points and assumptions you make here.  > Babysteps. Let's introduce an 80% tax rate or whatever before we're introducing a 99% or 100% tax rate.  I've never heard about a 99% tax rate.  You're talking a marginal income rate?  Anything that high is easily avoided with investment and capital gains.  That's why a wealth tax is perfect.  It prevents resource stagnancy by the wealthy, since a 2-4% wealth tax is *nothing* to anyone who is properly investing their wealth back into the economy.  Let's put a capital gains cap of 40%... a 4% wealth tax on someone making the "typical aggressive" 11% per year is an 80% effective income tax rate, lower than their tax rate was in the 1950's where they did just fine.  > There's also the aspect where if it was impossible to be a billionaire then companies would grow a certain amount and then just kind of stop growing once someone got their money  I don't believe this.  At some point, well before the owner/CEO having $1b, the company gets a life of its own.  If a near-billionaire starts strangling his company, there are probably other stakeholders who have a say that would complain.  Billionaires are generally not sole proprietors.  The are board members, stock owners, etc.  Even being a CEO alone doesn't ever make you a billionaire.    To remind you of perspective.  My local town has a builder who owns a dozen apartment complexes, is constantly building/selling 10+ houses at a massive margin, and owns several bars and restaurants.  The rapid way he's growing, he'll still probably never be a billionaire.    > Would Bill Gates retiring at 31 in 87 be a good thing? Or Steve Jobs retiring in 95?  This is the anti-communist argument too... But it's unreasonable to say that the richest people in the world are still *just doing it for money*.  People innovate for the sake of innovation.  Do you think Bill Gates didn't retire because he needed a job?  He could've retired on his stock alone and ended up as rich as he is now.  Any billionaire could.  It's about *control*.  > Not to mention that if they do retire at that point then they don't ever get that money so that it can be taxed  They're not printing money.  They're making it.  Other people would have gotten it.  I'm not one to believe the economy and value of the dollar are truly driven by a dozen people.  Nor should you be.  The economy is not a closed system, but it's also not an entirely open one.  > Warren's a capitalist for a reason and so am I. We need big structural change, not to burn the whole system down.  I agree we don't want to burn the whole system down, but that's different from pretending the system isn't broken.  We need a lot more welfare and cash distribution.  As much as I oppose his plans, we need to take a lesson from Yang about automation and preparing to build a state where you can be middle-class without working much (or at all).  Besides, she's a SocDem calling herself a capitalist to keep the moderates from getting scared, just like Bernie is a SocDem calling himself a socialist to rally the Left.  Neither one is really planning to destroy capitalism.  They're just looking to add a lot more welfare and worker control.
In one go? That‚Äôs how you get capital flight.
Did they get that money by:      Crushing or absorbing competition ‚úì   Lobbying the government to pass laws that favor their business ‚úì    Paying workers an unfair wage ‚úì   Suppressing labor unions ‚úì   Suppressing wage growth or hoarding it among execs ‚úì       Then is they money really theirs? Or are they stealing it from the working class via laws they produced with their $$?
ok boomer
Use the wrong word much? The word you were searching for is "envious". And, it has absolutely nothing to do with this conversation. That said, my daily-wear watch probably cost more than you make in 2 months. I'm doing OK.
We already have an exit tax.  Warren is just raising it.
I‚Äôm not sure the numbers, but a wealth tax only hurts like 0.0000001% of the population, while helping the other 99.999999%. Rarely do you get a policy which so explicitly helps practically everyone. Tempering is not necessary. With those numbers, grab as much as you can.
My issue is not with how much Bezos pays, but whether Warren's plan will prevent anyone from crossing $5 Billion in the future. To me, $5 Billion is the line where someone has more than more than enough and can afford every luxury they could ever want, so it's a reasonable cap. And it sounds like she would not have prevented Bezos from stealing all of his wealth anyway. And it's not 90 and 99%, right? Before he got divorced he had about $225 Billion, meaning leaving him 50 billion is almost 25%. And even if you only have 50 billion, you still stole 49 of it from your employees, almost as a rule and certainly in bezos' case (Zuckerberg more likely stole most of it from his user base by unlawfully stealing our data, although he certainly stole a lot of it from employees too.)
A VAT would raise three times the amount as a wealth tax. All the European nations who tried a wealth tax repealed them in favor of a VAT because the rich exploited the wealth tax by hiding their wealth. A VAT tax is on what the rich purchase which is easier to identify, instead of what they already own.
4 European countries still have it and Switzerland actually makes money on it. One issue with the Wealth Taxes in Europe is that it is much easier to avoid European taxes than American Taxes. It is an apple and oranges comparison given you can't just move to Ireland and say, "I live in Ireland now so I pay Irish taxes, not French."  Warren's healthcare plan includes methods of sureing up the IRS so it can go after the ultra-wealthy.

The point isn't that you could buy a country by purchasing it's GDP. That's ridiculous. The point is that, by analogy, if you have a pipe pushing water through it at 1000gallons/day, and you instantaneously dump 30,000 gallons through that pipe (1 month), you're going to completely break things and can twist that in your favor.   Similarly, if a billionaire were to dump $1billion into Nicaragua with the express purpose of becoming de-facto ruler, say through creating abject corruption, or mercenary groups, or similar, the sheer driving force of that much money with respect to what the country is used to is basically going to guarantee a success.
The fact that the guy peddling $1,000 per month in UBI is also the one who REALLY doesn't want to talk about wealth taxes should give you an idea of just how much money they're hoarding in that top percent.  Like, Jeff Bezos going to $15/hour minimum was obviously about that. "Hey let's just give them these crumbs so they don't come looking for my bag of cookies." But Christ, they've gotta have a whole factory back there if $1k/month to everyone is chump change.
The best best case scenario is Switzerland who generates 3.6% of their tax revenue from the wealth tax. The US tax revenue is $3.64T. 3.6% of that is $131B. Less than half of Warren's $275B/yr projection.   [Switzerland is also considered an international tax haven.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060716/why-switzerland-considered-tax-haven.asp) So the wealth tax is offset by the plethora of other tax benefits Switzerland has. That means the rich tolerate the wealth tax there to benefit from the other tax laws. In the US, corporations and the rich will be much less compliant. That means it will generate less tax revenue and increase the cost of administration to enforce compliance.
Billionaires are known of their fairly aggressive investing strategies though. They have enough assets to put a considerable number into more risky portfolios.
Isn't 4% a rule of thumb for the safe rate of withdrawal? I.e. how much of the principal you can spend each year without needing to worry about running dry?  This is distinct from the average rate of return, if, for no other reason than that the safe withdrawal rate needs to account for recessions and the average rate of return explicitly smooths the bumps out.  So a billionaire, who can live a middle/upperclass lifestyle forever on just the principal and interest of, like, half a percent of their wealth, doesn't give a flying flip about the safe rate of withdrawal.
It's a strawman, but one that we haven't worked hard to oppose.  "There should be no such thing as a billionaire" is not the same as "there should be no such thing as a millionaire"... and "There should be no such thing as a billionaire" is definitely not the same as "get out the guillotines".  Billionaires are not naturally evil, they're just naturally too rich... and it's our job, not theirs, to come up with a system that fixes that *fairly*.  There are billionaires who even agree that they have too much.  Both Bernie and Warren have billionaire supporters, who are *FOR* the wealth tax.
JK Rowling maybe
[I can](https://givingpledge.org/Pledger.aspx?id=177).  204 billionaires have signed the pledge to give away >99% of their wealth.  Rich people aren't automatically bad.  Some are.  Some are just people with a lot of money.  It's our job to create a system where their money is recycled efficiently to the rest of us.  Some of them even agree that's our job and are looking forward to a wealth tax.
I admit that I'm not an economist or anything so my knowledge of what exactly would happen if we make it impossible to be a billionaire is limited but I guess my main point is that our taxes should be in place to cause the maximum good for society. I got the whole 99% tax thing because that's essentially what it would mean if you made it impossible (not just hard) to be a billionaire.  Some people just seem to be angry at people for being billionaires or they think it would bring in a lot more taxes. If the optimal tax plan means that no billionaires exist that's fine with me. There also might be other reasons why billionaires shouldn't exist (equality for example).   I think we just have to step carefully or risk driving rich business owners and businesses out of America. And yes we shouldn't have to base our tax policy on that but we do. If the person moves out of America then the revenue we get from them is $0.   That any tax plan should be based on careful research and planning not some arbitrary limit that people set based off of platitudes.
What good is the capital doing in this country if it's not being spent on this country?
We do?  I am not aware of this, can you give me more info please
There is no difference between Warren and Sanders' wealth taxes below $5B, and over it it's only 1-2%.  While 1-2% more does have an effect on the growth or shrinkage of wealth, neither has a plan to prevent someone from crossing or staying above that threshold, particularly with the fast growth of Bezos' and Zuckerberg's fortunes.
And disproportionally hurt the average person over the rich. VATs are insanely regressive and terrible policy.
That wont have the intended effect in the near term because the rich don't spend their money.
States are already desperately exploiting that path.
Because people want to improve those things and care about other people who have less money. And all the candidates poll well against Trump but yeah, if he‚Äôs gonna cheat again there‚Äôs probably no chance you‚Äôre right. Your trolling isn‚Äôt gonna change anything though so stick to what you know. Are you talking about the San Gabriel valley? I used to live there actually
Also the whole line about it being difficult for people who‚Äôs net worth is tied up in assets instead of cash.  Who cares?  Lack of liquidity isn‚Äôt a justification for poor people to not pay their taxes.  I don‚Äôt really give a hoot if you have to sell your 3rd Malibu mansion to pay your taxes this year.  You know when the money is due, and you already have a personal accountant if you have that kind of dough.  There is literally 0 excuse for not being able to pay it.
How is the ‚Äúbest best case scenario‚Äù a number based on a country where the wealthiest person ‚Äúonly‚Äù has $8 billion dollars?  Wealth in America makes Switzerland‚Äôs richest people look like peasants.
I was using the scenario that the person I responded to laid out, which was their best guess at safe market returns. My point is you can't take it the average and maintain your wealth, let alone increase it.  But, to your point, look up Warren Buffet's thoughts on this. It's incredibly hard to continually beat the market. He even bet a hedge fund director that the S&P would outgain the fund if his choice and won. Buffett has famously been able to fairly consistently beat the market by reading 80 hours per week. But, if all you needed was capital to beat the market, then people polling their money together in a fund would be able to beat the market and that would be the best investment strategy.
Yes, and I agree with what you said. I'm merely trying to point that out to OP, who was suggesting that Billionaires could live off 7%, that that isn't really the case.
Billionaires are absolutely naturally evil
It's our job to decide how the money gets put back into the system for the benefit of the society writ large. The billionaires pledge is a fine idea but it should hardly be left up to them, or their notions of charity, to decide how and where to use that money.
I know.  I'm getting attacked by someone in this very thread because I will not agree that merely having a billion dollars makes you a terrible human being.  He even told me I don't belong on the Left and should go become a moderate.  The idea of it being impossible to be a billionaire should not, IMO, be so heavy handed as "every penny over $1b you make should be taken away", since it fails to account for the fact that a LOT of things are wrong in a lot of parts of society/business if a person is capable of approaching that $1b mark.  It should be more like crossing the speed of light, not slamming into a brick wall... And it should be more organic than just upping taxes toward 100% as a person gets close to $1b... because *WHY* is someone able to bring that kind of money in in the first place?  At some point, as much value as you provide to the world, you're not single-handedly worth more to the world than over a thousand doctors.  > That any tax plan should be based on careful research and planning not some arbitrary limit that people set based off of platitudes.  The problem with *this* concept is that... how?  It's pretty hard to research a tax without adding it.  We *do* already have the ability to estimate how much money will be brought in by use the tax.  We can even estimate how much an individual will pay.  We cannot, however, calculate whether it'll lead to billionaires criminally avoiding our exit tax and illegally living in a non-extradition country.  We can plan all we want, but we cannot predict what tax loopholes the wealthy will find... but we make it simple, we make it target the ultra-rich, and we minimize loopholes, and things might go ok.
It does do good. It‚Äôs being invested.
Yeah, if you leave with a lot of money the government acts like you sold all your stuff and sends a tax bill.  It's not as aggressive because right now "selling all your stuff" only taxes you on profit, so some may still think it's worth taking the penalty, but it's not a no-cost transaction to leave the country just in case.  https://americansoverseas.org/en/knowledge-centre/us-taxes-and-liability/exit-tax-us/
according to what data
You‚Äôve never seen a yacht? Entire industries rely on wealthy people.
exactly
Percent is a measure of proportion. Not absolute value.
And I greatly appreciate your correction -- I have been duly corrected. Of course, I'm pretty sure even a billionaire couldn't find $69 million a year worth of depreciating or non-recoverable assets to spend money on, so this entire scenario is inherently absurd and irreverent  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
So let's say the Powerball got REALLY high one day, like $1.4b.  And you didn't even buy a ticket, your aunt bought it for you.  But holy shit.  You won!  How long are you evil?  How quickly do you have to divest of your money not to be going to "political Hell"?   Since philanthropy is a tax write off (especially if you do it right, you'll never have to pay taxes again), do you have to actually take out all the money in a bag and burn it to become good again?  Is there no way you'd be able to use that $1b+ to improve society that wouldn't keep you Evil naturally?  How long do you have to bathe to get the evil off you?  And why are you even voting?  For anyone? EVERY single candidate on both sides of the presidential election has at least a couple "Evil" billionaire backers who fully support their agenda.  Clearly no agenda, not even a wealth tax or redistribution, is OK if a billionaire supports it, right?  I accuse the idea that billionaires are naturally evil of being divisive, and isn't originating from any major Left camp at all.
The person I responded to said "I can't think of any examples where they learned to give back".  I provided a counter-example.  I think you're not really responding to the thread, so your reply doesn't really make much sense in context.  FWIW, I agree with you.  Doesn't mean that Steve Markoff (a Bernie-supporting billionaire) is literally the same as Jobs (who publicly ridiculed philanthropy and made fun of Bill Gates for trying to help the world)
Sometimes memes make themselves
At least he only blew .4% of his networth on his campaign.  That's like if a Median household spent $389.20.  My car repair hurt me 2 times harder than Bloomberg trying to buy the Primary.
I am really hoping that this momentum leads to Warren being included in all polls, punditry, analysis, etc. There has been too much ignoring the current third place delegate count in favor of those candidates with none.
I wouldn't count him out just yet. Not trying to stir shit just being totally realistic, here.  It's not that warren didn't rip into him... it's that the people backing him may well not care.   I suspect this will either hurt him badly, or do nothing to him at all. (by nothing at all I don't mean this blunts his growith - I mean it'll either hurt him badly or simply have no impact at all, meaning he could keep rising in the future)
I made a meme for this too.       [https://i.redd.it/9t9e9ixnd3i41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/9t9e9ixnd3i41.jpg)
This is great
I'm a Pete fan but I wanted to stop by and say that it was excellent to watch Liz smashing Bloomberg yesterday. Huge fan.
You go girl!!!!
Bernie supporter here. Liz dragging Bloomberg was the most satisfying moment of any of the debates so far.
This is the best
This is perfect <3
I'm so happy Warren did this. What a statement!
It was nice to see her old fire back.
What happened?
One hopes.
Boooooooom!!! The sound of his supporters dropping him like a bad habit!
I really hope this happens.
[removed]
Yeah. But millions of people are not making memes about your car repairs.  Have you ever paid hundreds of dollars to willingly get shamed by a Harvard law professor in public?
Yeah if Warren doesn‚Äôt win Bloomie and I will have spent about the same portion of our wealth on a losing campaign.
Something something percent of people can‚Äôt afford a $400 emergency expense something something.
I keep thinking about how much that money could have helped new voter registration and GOTV infrastructure and down ticket candidates.
And, let's be frank, too much emphasis put on two very white states that don't look like the  actual democratic base.  Thus Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's numbers get inflated.  I don't believe that they can withstand a more diverse voting electorate.

True, I never say never in politics after Trump won. But she probably dented any growth in support he might've got to overtake Sanders
>I wouldn't count him out just yet. Not trying to stir shit just being totally realistic, here.  Fair point.  I remember when Trump's campaign "ended" after the Access Hollywood tape came out.
I feel like a lot of his support in the polls came from the low information voter who just saw the 1000's of ads he put out joining him at the hip to Obama.  Now that he's been exposed; I think that number deflates.  Some of it was Biden support moving over to Bloomberg, who might go back to Biden or another candidate.
I love the increase in memes on this sub over the last few weeks. These are so much fun.
What don't you do a separate post with the meme so that more people can enjoy it?!
You guys are always so polite. thanks
Pete's best line of the night, imo, was that if we aren't careful, we will end up with the two most polarizing candidates, neither of which are democrats.  That's not verbatim, but you get the point.  He made a very good point.  Let's nominate a democrat!
Ah, thanks!
Actually she's not been burning bridges with actual democrats, and her supporters are very high on the list as far as percentage planning to support blue, no matter who.  Your extreme claims suggest that you are a bad troll.
Removed: Trolling
Maybe Bloomberg has some weird findom kink and this was all part of the plan?
He was spending it to try to make sure he doesn‚Äôt have to pay 2% of it in a wealth tax. It‚Äôs an investment for him.
"Smashed" ins't the word I would have personally used, but yes I have. Money well spent.
Ha! I‚Äôm sure you know, but yours is, by far, the more commendable investment.
I don't hang around your sub trashing your candidate, stop doing it here. And why would you self-identify as a bernie bro?
I'm a middle-aged Bernie/Warren/Harris guy--Knock it off, you teenage edgelord dipshit, this is serious business. Let the electoral process play out a bit and resist the urge to stick your dick into it where it's not welcome.
Bernie supporter to Bernie supporter: Fuckin stop
> But she probably dented any growth in support he might've got to overtake Sanders  I'm not certain about that, either.   The kind of person who likes bloomberg isn't likely to like warren or Bernie, anyway.  That said, personally I'd be okay if bloomberg overtook sanders. Neither of them are my preference but I think sanders represents a significantly bigger electoral risk than bloomberg.
>I feel like a lot of his support in the polls came from the low information voter who just saw the 1000's of ads he put out  So, I'm gonna just go ahead and quote myself from another thread since I said almost the same thing:  Nate Silver has been tweeting about this incessantly, explaining that this isn't the case and that people who assume that he's solely doing well because of ads/money are totally misunderstanding how money in politics and the influence of advertising actually works.  And to add to that, I work in advertising. You can't make people like a bad product by just blanketing the world with ads. Even good ads.  People like bloomberg because he's a moderate with experience who isn't Joe Biden.   (OK copied bit over - back to me talking again)  I know that pretty much everyone in this sub will not think that last sentence is a good reason to support Bloomberg, but it's important to understand that not all voters think the way we do.  We wouldn't be in a 5 way race with no clear majority if that was the case.
[removed]
Findom? Is that like femdom?  If so I wouldn't be surprised what so ever. Plus the way Warren towers over him only makes it more believable.
Precisely.
Lol sometimes you can invest purely. Fortunately he's not smart enough to invest in Trump.
> "Smashed" ins't the word I would have used  Cool; neither did they. ;)    (They wrote "shamed")
This is probably a troll or someone saying in a poor way that both progressive candidates get ignored or disparaged by the main news channels.
Glad to see someone from Bernie‚Äôs camp call out their own camp! We all need to be conscious of negativity regardless of the source
I think Biden will see a bump because he is no longer the most conservative candidate option. Basically everyone from Liz to Joe seemed more moderate with Bernie and Mike on the stage.
Life is about taking risks and Trump isn't as strong as people want to think. The demographics of america have shifted a lot since 2016 and 1 in 10 Sanders voters in 2016 voted for Trump. That's automatically voter loss from Trump
"People like Bloomberg because he's a moderate with experience who isn't Joe Biden" Because he painted himself as such in his ads.  But then last night they found out that he isn't really a moderate, but more a centrist or even center right former republican who endorsed Bush; and that he has a whole host of skeletons in his closet. He definitely got Biden's support; but he also set his message, unchallenged by his carpet bombing ads.   Now that he's been vetted, I expect his support to drop.  And those voters to go back to Biden or pick another candidate altogether.

LOL I was wondering...
Yeah, I‚Äôm not buying your line of reasoning. ‚ÄúLife is about taking risks‚Äù would be a hilarious campaign slogan for Sanders though.
>Life is about taking risks  That's really not related to anything I was saying. All I'm trying to say is don't draw big conclusions about bloomberg from this debate.   >and Trump isn't as strong as people want to think.  And that just isn't something you can know more than anyone else. It's what you *think* but you it's not the objective truth, which no one knows for sure.   That said, the smart money - people like nate silver - do not agree with you on that. He's not automatically right, either, but I trust him more than you, no offense.   >The demographics of america have shifted a lot since 2016  Not really, no. The demographics are still pretty similar to 2016.   >and 1 in 10 Sanders voters in 2016 voted for Trump. That's automatically voter loss from Trump.   What? No it's not.   Just because they went bernie-trump in 2016 doesn't mean they're gonna go back to bernie automatically this time.
> "People like Bloomberg because he's a moderate with experience who isn't Joe Biden" Because he painted himself as such in his ads.  I am sorry to be blunt but no.   If you just look at his record - which is publically available on places other than his website - it's generally moderate, if not leaning left in fact.  I'm not saying there aren't reasons someone could have to not like him. Heck, I'm not saying *anything* about how you or anyone else should feel about him. If you don't wanna like him, don't like him.  But if you're gonna suggest he's not a moderate or that the only reason he has any support is because of the ads... then you're just gonna be incorrect.   But don't take it up with me, take it up with Nate Silver.   >Now that he's been vetted, I expect his support to drop. And those voters to go back to Biden or pick another candidate altogether.  This entire conversation stems from me saying to not count him out because we just don't know whether this will have an impact on the voters who like him.   But if you want to do that anyway, go for it.
That's all well and good and it should be obvious comments are opinion based but to think Bloomberg has a better shot of beating Trump, you're out of touch. He was a Republican until 2007.
Time will tell.  I say he tanks.
>That's all well and good and it should be obvious comments are opinion based but to think Bloomberg has a better shot of beating Trump, you're out of touch.    No, I'm not. At all.  And if that's really where you're gonna rest your argument - after admitting everything is opinion, going on to suggest I'm out of touch for having a totally valid opinion that isn't even remotely beyond the realm of possibility - I'm not sure I wanna continue this conversation.  Bloomberg absolutely has a good shot to beat trump and thinking he's got a better shot than bernie isn't out of touch, it is common sense. At least, it's common sense everywhere except reddit where people are obsessed with Bernie Sanders.    >He was a Republican until 2007.  So?  We're talking about IF he's the nominee.   Him being a republican only hurts him in his path to *become* nominee. Once he's the nominee, his being a republican in the past is arguably more of a benefit than a drawback.  Also, he was only a republican for 6 years. He's donated to far, far more democrats than republicans. Pinning the republican thing on him like it's bad is no better than people who try to pin the same thing on warren for her past.
I'm not saying he won't.   I'm saying don't act like you know.
And yet, you are acting like you know.
>And yet, you are acting like you know.  No I'm not. In fact I've explicitly said otherwise multiple times.   I get that you disagree with my POV but you don't have to mischaracterize my position to defend yours.
This is beyond pointless and tedious. Goodbye

republicans and corporations prefer you pay 5000 in premiums than 500 in taxes
+ $5000 deductible  + $30 copays  + $$$ for out of network care
1,000 taxes   0 premiums  $800 taxes   50k ER visit (let's not forget those without insurance)
I don't understand how people think that her saying, paraphrased, that the overall cost will be less is "avoiding the question". The issue should always be overall cost! Who cares if you have a $200 or so tax increase if you're saving hundreds in medical costs. I have health insurance through my employer and I still pay \~$120 a month on it plus $30 copays, and a $1000 deductible +10% of anything over the deductible. The only way I wouldn't save money with medicare for all would be if I literally only went to the doctor once a year for a check up and that's not even possible since I have to check in with my Psychiatrist at least every 6 months. All they want during the debates is a sound bite of Warren saying she's raising taxes and she's not playing that game!
If we're getting into the weeds, we really cannot say for sure that everyone will see savings. Some people are going to see a greater tax increase than a lowering in their premiums. However, those who are mostly struggling to afford their health insurance will likely have savings, and that's what Medicare for All is about. Many people are going to see a major benefit, but some will not, and that's just the reality of the situation.  News outlets like CNN are deliberately trying to poison voters' minds against the benefit of lower cost per capita (which Warren is repeatedly arguing along with Bernie) by invoking the tax question. It pisses me off to no end that this is what we're focused on, when the issue has to be framed around saving per capita costs and ultimately reducing health care bankruptcies. Oh, and not to mention people can actually see a doctor without having to worry about changing coverage networks or paying co-pays out their ass.
If we taught statistics in high school math classes, we would already have Medicare for All. Cost variance is more stressful for humans than a slightly higher, much less variable cost. Gee it sure would be nice to know how much i need to put aside for taxes. I guess I‚Äôll find out later, when I can give a proper freakout.
[deleted]
This is a poor argument and demonstrates how little we understand about Medicare for all.  If we take total healthcare spending and spread it out over the existing tax base, then we can expect to about double the cost of premiums depending on income (assuming $2T/10yr in overall savings which imo is a poor assumption given how much care avoidance exists).  This also doesn't speak to the fact the minorities who spend considerably less on healthcare will spend considerably more under a single payer plan (arguably institutional racism by design).  The fact is that single payer is about providing care for people who need it.  It is not about saving money but saving LIVES.  It is an economic windfall for boomers and the sick.  It is not an economic windfall for the working class, but it will do wonders for life expectancy overall.
I at one point last night I got so frustrated with that line of questions towards Warren after the debate that I literally yelled at my television, then turned it off.  CNN blows, these debates are a joke. No one actually gets to debate any one single issue and CNN is just baiting for sound bites.
With Bernie's plan, I would pay more.  And assuming Elizabeth Warren's is the same, I am fine with that.  1. No uncertainty about whether something will be covered. 2. No need to delay treatment sometimes, while doctor works things out with insurance company. 3. No need to spend time deciding between my employer's health care plans every year. 4. No need to worry if I lose my job and have to pay some crazy COBRA price. 5. And most importantly - those less fortunate are not dying due to lack of care!  Empathy is something that is lacking.  We live in cities, having sick people dying on the street, people who need mental health care, the current situation is no good.
How much does Joe Biden‚Äôs plan cost? He has no idea and hasn‚Äôt even taken the time to calculate it. How much does Pete‚Äòs plan cost? Same thing, he has no idea. But the media lets them get away with it and pretends that Liz Warren isn‚Äôt being honest unless she says ‚Äútaxes will go up‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcosts will go down‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bunch of bull and makes me feel not good about those moderate candidates, which I want to avoid going into the presidential election.
She should just say yes. Stephen Colbert and many others have tried giving her her own answer. It looks bad not admitting even though overall it will lower costs.
Warren has to be "evasive" on this point because she takes herself seriously as a candidate. The sound bite of "Yes, we're raising taxes" could kill her candidacy. It's frustrating that she has to be evasive, but that's politics.
I mean, it would be less of an argument if she actually proposed the tax that would pay for it (even some suggestions). It's more the fact that the financing is so unclear.
She should just stick this meme on her podium at the next debate.
Guys, lets be real here. Everyone knows that what Americans really want is the ability to choose between the blood-sucking parasite that extracts wealth from the system by denying coverage to all but the healthiest individuals, and a kneecapped medicare forced to cover the sickest individuals without adequate funding to do so. As long as we have a choice in the matter, that is what truly counts!  ^(/s)
I at one point last night I got so frustrated with that line of questions towards Warren after the debate that I literally yelled at my television, then turned it off.  CNN blows, these debates are a joke. No one actually gets to debate any one single issue and CNN is just baiting for sound bites.
Bernie flat out stated that taxes will go up last night when asked, why can't Warren?
Can anyone explain why she's dragging her feet on explaining these details? I like her and this keeps coming up.
Yeah and that's if your premiums are 300. Mine were 900  at my last job for a 6000 deductible.
One thing that is also not factored into the conversation is the cost of time. I‚Äôm Canadian and have friends who recently moved to the states. They all work for big tech companies with the best healthcare plans money can buy. Without fail they bring up the stress of calling/dealing with insurance companies and the time it takes up. That is a cost. If it‚Äôs that big of a cost/burden for wealthy singles in their twenties, I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like for the average middle/low class family. In Canada it‚Äôs not even something that I think about/crosses my mind. Single payer healthcare is not up for debate here by the way. Every party across entire political spectrum supports it. This is the case in every country it‚Äôs been implemented.
I love both Bernie and Warren but curious if either of their plans handles this situation.  Right now most employers cover your medical benefits BEFORE your income.  I own my company and our average medical costs are about $500 per employee per month but these can be $1000 or more for larger companies where there are more families.  Right now what SHOULD happen is that your employer should take that $500 and add it to your income which should then be taxes.  However, what I *think* is going to happen is that your employer will just *keep* that money thereby lowering your income.  I think that we're going to have to require the employer to add this to your income.  I'm CERTAIN that basically all big companies are going to do this to basically steal from their employees.  PS. I'm not a Russian troll :)
I love the whey station
I support and donate to both Buttigieg and Warren. I LOVE Warren's policies but do have a concern when it comes to health care. Here is my simplified take, comparing M4A and M4A Who Want It.   * Both M4AWWI and M4A promise to lower overall costs and provide universal healthcare access to all. * To implement M4AWWI, Buttigieg will need to pass a M4AWWI bill and reverse Trump's tax cuts to the wealthy. * To implement Sanders' M4A, Warren will need to:    * pass the M4A bill    * pass a wealth tax bill to pay for the majority of the costs of M4A    * pass another bill to increase other taxes (e.g. pay roll taxes, some of which will be imposed on the middle class) unless this can be done through executive power.    * pass a constitutional test of her proposed wealth tax. Due to questions regarding its constitutionality, Warren's proposed wealth tax plan will likely face a legal challenge in the US Supreme Court. So even if the bill gets passed, it will likely be tied up in the Supreme Court.    * manage a HUGE transition where the private health insurance industry (people, assets and all) will be eliminated or transformed into massive state-owned/run Medicare operation, within four years.  Looking at the long list of things we would need to get done before we get to universal coverage, M4A just seems so daunting and any road block along the way would really get in the middle of American people having the healthcare access that we need.   I personally think it would be wise for her to come up with her own healthcare plan instead of going with Sanders' M4A. This is more consistent with wanting deliver results for the majority of the American people, and less risky for people who are sick and waiting.
Supreme Chancellor Trump will not lose his reign and capitalism will always prevail. Rich people like me will continue to thrive! I worked for it, mind you- just like you all should, bloody peasants!
Why don't they ever call out the moderators for how they're trying to frame the question?
When you don't answer a straightforward question multiple times but are still said to have won the debate.
Who TF is only paying 300/annually in premiums?
So, question for you guys.   I'm in the military, and my Healthcare is Tricare and provided through my employer (the Military)   I don't pay premiums already, yet under Warren and Bernie's plan (although Warren isn't honest about it) my taxes will go up. How is this beneficial to me or to those who have employer provided health insurance that they like?
I don't come to fight or argue, really looking for information:  I feel like Warren would be bad for me personally, though I could be wrong. If my wife and I make around $160,000 annually with one dependent and currently pay around $520/month for health insurance and around $80/month max in copays, would Warren's M4A be bad for us?  I think it was Buttigieg (not sure) that floated a $10,000 increase in taxes for the plan, but obviously that's dependent on a lot of things like income level. Just based on what I've read and heard it seems like the plan would cost my family thousands more than what we have now.  I appreciate any clarity, thanks!  Edit: interesting i got downvoted for this, was genuinely seeking information. Not a big deal for me but not a good look for people seeking info about your preferred candidate.

Exactly. What a bunch of morons in the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù on these issues. Sometimes the thing between two solutions isn‚Äôt always the better solution‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing private insurance can do for people that Medicare for All can‚Äôt do better and cheaper.
Exactly and this is so easy and obvious...but I do find it odd that she won‚Äôt just say this? When she immediately jumps to costs being down every time, why doesn‚Äôt she just say ‚Äúyes taxes may go up depending on your income level, but for most people no they won‚Äôt, and for those that it does the healthcare savings will far outweigh the increased taxes‚Äù. An odd lack of nuance for the candidate I got on board with because of her nuance
Bernie has better plan y‚Äôall trippin
I think it's about being honest and explaining like it really is. We all know the math. People want honesty.
The issue is why is it so hard for her to say this?
CNN and Buttgieg is doing the Trump and the GOP's work for them
Yeah, if ones things for sure, I know I can trust the government to more efficiently allocate resources than I can!
Please do your research.  She‚Äôs the bright spot in a dismal political climate.
[removed]
Exactly, that's the line I would take
Warren will cave on Medicare for All when she becomes the nominee.
\*freedomiums
The other part of that equation they don't tell you is that we do pay for healthcare in taxes.  Every claim to an insurance company is ultimately deducted from their taxes anyway, we subsidize these assholes.  Get rid of them and not only do we stop losing that revenue, but the money they currently amass with their little scam stays in the Economy.
Yachts don‚Äôt buy themselves.
Don‚Äôt forget the follow up questions if she does say yes- ‚Äúhow much are you going to raise taxes on the middle class?‚Äù That‚Äôs why she isn‚Äôt opening up that path.
Republicans and corporations prefer you pay $5000 in premiums \_and\_ $500 in taxes. Then they get to pocket it all when the corporate subsidies come rolling in.
It's the dril tweet only far more depressing
How many hours do you spend a year finding out if a new doctor or treatment is in your current insurance? How many hours do you spend double checking that all your doctor's are covered by the next year's policy?  I did not spend long enough on that second part and some doctors fell off our coverage last year to this year.   I would pay EXTRA to not have to worry about that. But they are offering it for cheaper than what I have to pay now.
This people often forget how it all adds up once you need it. Any regular care or even a life event like a new child can cost you thousands out of pocket even after $400 a month premiums.  Its tough to see the value when you are young and healthy and I understand that. Its disgusting to not see the value as a retiree because you have medicare/medicaid and already pay next to nothing.    Meanwhile the people working day-to-day mid-career and their employers are carrying the lions share of the burden.  FWIW, I lived in England years ago for a year and paid taxes to the Queen. They have NHS there. You still do your US taxes but you deduct what you paid the other government. Interesting note, I did not get a refund even though my taxes included NHS my bill was near identical in both countries.
Then throw in treatments not covered by plans, the hassle of prior authorization, plan limitations, or suffering through months of "step therapy" that don't work until failing on everything treatment except the original treatment your MD suggested in the first damn place. Insurance companies should not dictate our medical treatment.
Yea this nonstop taxes question is so unbelievably dishonest by CNN, it is sickening. I‚Äôm glad she stayed tough and focused on total cost.
I agree.  Yea, they're saying she's "avoiding the question" because she's not giving the sound bite they want.  "You didn't say 'your taxes will go up' so you're not answering the question!"
I totally agree, the fact that we are talking about taxes as the only cost that matters is missing the point and plays directly into Republican talking points. Biden says his plan costs $750 billion compared to $30 trillion but that‚Äôs only if you count taxes. Biden‚Äôs plan likely actually costs trillions more than Warren‚Äôs all totaled but he only mentions taxes when he discusses how much his plan ‚Äúcosts‚Äù. Americans also have to pay trillions under his plan in premiums, copays, and deductibles, but he ignores that completely when he talks about ‚Äúcosts‚Äù. And the media lets him get away with it. The only conversation worth having is one about overall costs.   Having said that, I think it would be better if she just acknowledged that she was raising taxes and then pivot to a discussion as to why that misses the point, which she is very good at.
Yeah it's an attempt at misinformation because you know the media won't report it honestly and explain to the American people that m4a puts more money in working people's pockets. They'll just play the "your taxes are going up" sound bite over and over again.
Thanks for pointing out that some people won‚Äôt save money. Some of her voters are single people who are younger that rarely make use of doctors. I have no prescriptions and have not gotten sick in 5 years. Do I support Medicare? Yes, but I think it is disingenuous to keep repeating ‚Äúcosts will go down for middle class families‚Äù and not talk about low-income households, single people, or what specific tax brackets will be adversely affected.    Also - As Warren herself uses as proof that total cost is what matters - families have to have a budget. This means they need to know where money is going to come out and flow back into the budgets. Bernie clears this up nicely without providing a bad sound bite IMO.   I, for one, would be okay with taking the brunt of more taxes if it meant better healthcare for everyone (at the aggregate level). However smart her strategy seems, I just don‚Äôt appreciate the commentary. There is an intentional omission of information, and that is why the evasion is important. Defending it does not make that go away. It will need to be addressed at some point.
Doesn't matter. Buttgieg wanted to be seen as a "moderate" and rise a few points in the polls at Warren's expense
Part of the worry that many voters have is that we actually don't know how much our taxes will be increased to pay for this, because Elizabeth Warren hasn't informed us how high she intends the rate to be to pay for an extremely expensive plan ($3 trillion annually). This is particularly worrying for the numerous people who have low yearly medical costs.  If a presidential candidate proposes spending, the candidate ought to explain how they're going to pay for it.   Has Sanders suffered by giving up the sound bite of raised taxes on the middle class? I think many voters appreciate his honesty and straightforwardness, even if they don't support the plan.
Not everybody goes to the doctor but everybody pays taxes. It's a valid question to ask if she is going to raise taxes. The only way to fund a medicare for all system is to tax EVERYONE. In my opinion her defense should be the middle class voters that agree with paying a slight tax increase to fund a system everyone is going to use.   As a classical liberal, my only concern is how are we going to force doctors into a medicare for all system. The VA being the closest example, is horribly managed. That's not a good thing.
We also live in a society, the whole point is that we are supposed to take care of each other.  This country is obsessed with individuality, the entire point we started tribes is because living in a community is for the benefit of all.
>not to mention people can actually see a doctor without having to worry about changing coverage networks or paying co-pays out their ass.  but people love their insurance! this premium is o cute and have you seen that nice deductible?
How to estimate if a M4A or other full single payer national insurance plans are better for you (and your employer) if most of your money is from regular wage/salary income:    * Start with your W2 Box 12 DD, this is what your employer paid in premiums for you.  * Add the premiums you paid. This may be attached to your W2 or just on your paystubs * Add how much you spent out of pocket on all healthcare (prescriptions, copays, deductibles, dental, vision)   Divide this by your total W2 income in Box 5 (or add in other sources of gross income) and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.    If this is less than the tax that would apply directly to you + the tax paid by your employer (replacing those 12DD premiums they pay) then that single-payer plan is better for you financially.
This is a key point but very hard to make clear in a presidential debate. For example, some people with employer sponsored insurance will see their taxes go up. Since they are not currently paying for their own insurance, they will end up losing money. On the whole, Medicare for all should certainly save money, but that‚Äôs not true for every single person.
We can make good estimates based on known healthcare spending now, using ranges of costs/savings, and plotting against revenue derrived from the average tax base.  We know for instance that a 70-year old retiree who is paying roughly $12k/yr on healthcare will spend considerably less in taxes (less income in retired years) than a 25-year old worker spending $3k per year on healthcare.  The overall share of healthcare spending skews dramatically toward the old and sick.  Single payer switches it to the tax base.  So essentially, everyone between 19 and 65 who isn't sick will pay more overall.  But they will have access to care that is essential to preserving life when and if they need it.  Meanwhile, the sick and old will have economic security and receive care.
Good point and it's something she should be more open/clear about. Ideally she could thoughtfully explain how disproportionately it will improve the financial situation for the older population which is a demographic she can make significant gains with.
I feel like this sub has been very good about that, but r/ourpresident shits all over Warren and tries to divide progressives. It is infuriating. I used to have a Bernie bumper sticker, totally supported him, but now he's my second choice. Seeing that sub conduct itself so badly is incredibly frustrating. We need to have each others' backs. If Bernie gets the nomination, Warren supporters need to back him and vice versa.  Example:   https://www.np.reddit.com/r/OurPresident/comments/dirxvh/i_decided_to_clean_this_graphic_up_a_bit_seems/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Thank you. Bernie is one of the best candidates we have the pleasure of considering in this field. While I am all in for Warren now, I will be more than excited to campaign for him if he's the nominee.
Sometimes I think Warren is shielding him since we are still more than a year away. One of them will win, and that‚Äôs what matters.
Warren is pragmatic. Bernie is not
That depends on how the tax structure goes, does it not? We should be able to drive down the per capita spending under M4A, which gives us the opportunity to drive down overall costs to consumers.   Right now my employer provided coverage costs about $1000 per pay period (which is every two weeks). I only pay around $100 and my employer picks up the other $900. Since M4A provides considerable savings for employers, a considerable amount of the tax revenue has to come from employers, not employees.   Basically, if you replace my $2000 a month plan with something that costs $1000 a month, that could be very good for me (if around 90% of the new tax goes to employers) or very bad for me (if all or most of the new tax burden falls on me rather than my employer). And Warren said she won‚Äôt vote on anything like the ladder.
What you mean Ellen isn't more important than Climate Change and Immigration? CNN disagrees.
Bernie has managed to be straightforward in saying how he‚Äôs going to pay for Medicare for All and has the most money in the Democratic field.....so being honest clearly didn‚Äôt kill his campaign.   Could the reason that Warren is so evasive on Medicare for All be that she doesn‚Äôt actually believe in it? Seems like the most plausible answer considering my above statement.
The two-cent tax she proposed would cover it.
What I've seen of the M4A plans is its basically 2.2% flat income tax plus a 6.2% payroll tax on the employer side (roughly replacing what a lot of big employers pay already). The balance is made up with higher taxes on the rich and some future cost savings (pharma and providers likely taking a haircut)  plus efficiency gains.
Don't forget that health insurance ad right before she went on
My guess is that she's trying to avoid a clip of her saying "Taxes will go up" to be played on an infinite loop to scare Boomers on TV.
She doesn‚Äôt want to give them the Republican sound bite. I think it‚Äôs pretty crappy of the other candidates to be trying to do Republican‚Äôs work for them.   But I agree that at this point she should just say she will raise them and then explain why that‚Äôs a good deal for Americans.
Because the number of people who saw her refuse to give the sound bite last night is smaller than the number of people who would see the Republican ad with it in it.
she makes this point every time she is asked the question, the problem is the media wants to ask it as a yes or no question and she isnt having none of that.  she not going to let them spin just half of the policy when it needs to be look at in whole.
She doesn‚Äôt want to give the clip to Republicans of her saying she is going to raise taxes. The media and many politicians treat taxes like the ultimate evil and ignore payments made through premiums copays and deductibles. She doesn‚Äôt want to play their game of making ‚Äútax‚Äù a dirty word.   Having said that, she should just acknowledge she is going to raise taxes and explain why that is a good thing.
b/c it will give people ads to attack her in the general election. it's smart.  though i do think she should just say "fuck it, here's why it's cheaper even if you get taxed"
**Warren:** "OK, yes, under my plan, middle class taxes will go up some, but that will be more than cancelled out by eliminating insurance industry premiums, copays, deductibles, and profit-taking. The middle class will have more money and peace of mind under this plan."  **50 billion TV and digital ads:** "BIG GOVERNMENT LIBERAL LIZ WARREN WANTS TO RAISE TAXES ON MILLIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES:  >"Under my plan, middle class taxes will go up."  "PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, VOTE TRUMP 2020"  Remember the endless out-of-context clips of Obama saying "you didn't build that"? It would be that x10,000.
I‚Äôm in her camp now and I agree. It doesn‚Äôt take an genius to realize that she‚Äôs deflecting and refusing to say ‚Äúyour taxes will go up.‚Äù Just own it. I effing hate Bernie, but at least he‚Äôs being honest and saying ‚Äútaxes will go up but premiums will go down resulting in a net savings.‚Äù She‚Äôs just coming off as disingenuous on this plan and I don‚Äôt understand why.
There is no such thing as "no premiums" technically. You pay for your health insurance through an artificially lower pay most likely or it would directly come from the federal budget. I imagine that in those situations, we could raise the wage of people like you at no cost (given that the federal budget was previously subsidizing your healthcare).
It‚Äôs beneficial because the DOD will have to pay you more, now that Tricare is not one of the benefits keeping you in service.
M4A is an amazing plan that covers everyone. I would never argue that "I already have good health care, therefore no one else deserves it." You are correct that military benefits that are replaced should be accompanied by an increase in military pay. There is no private health plan that is going to be superior to the power of monopsony. [Unless you are into a "survival of the fittest" society where 30,000 people born in the wrong families die every year because they cant afford health care.]
>If my wife and I make around $160,000 annually with one dependent and currently pay around $520/month for health insurance and around $80/month max in copays, would Warren's M4A be bad for us?  Does that $520 include both premium and deductible? If it does, then you are paying about $7200/yr on healthcare.  Although it's not set in stone yet, Bernie‚Äôs plan proposes a 4% tax. That would come down to $6400/yr for you. Looks like you are saving money under Bernie‚Äôs Medicare for All.  Buttigieg and the others are just fear-mongering if anything.
Insurance company would fuck you over in a heartbeat if their profit is threatened. M4A wouldn‚Äôt.  You are also not taking into consideration of deductible and likely increase for your premium.   You are also only looking out for yourself which is not what Medicare for ALL is about. You are wealthy (but let‚Äôs be honest not that wealthy and you are likely not the target that warren will mostly focus on the tax increase on), but look around there are so many other people that are not. And I think it‚Äôs time that a president pay attention to the people that the system is not currently supporting and make big structural change around that to make sure EVERYONE gets the help they need.  I feel like this is more of a philosophical question rather than numbers.
With my government job, I pay 126 a paycheck for health insurance. But my job pays 450 a pay check.   That is just shy of $15k a year.   People are not wrong to worry about exactly how taxes will change. But they vastly under rate how much we, as a society, are currently paying.
Just wanted to follow up, you shouldn't have been downvoted for your question. Warren actually released a calculator today along with her proposal of how to pay for M4A. Feel free to plug your numbers in and see how they work out. https://elizabethwarren.com/calculator/medicare-for-all
Because if there is a sound bite of her saying taxes would go up, the context of the impact on overall costs will be cut out in a soundbite that is played repeatedly on Fox and ads funded by the RNC, hospitals, and insurance companies.
You mean like the one where they say tax cuts to the wealthy helps the economy?
That would be the biggest flip flop in the history of politics and disastrous for her candidacy.  You're delusional if you think she's that conniving.
Your understanding of taxes is laughable. It's not a subsidy for companies to deduct the cost of doing business, as we tax them on profits not gross receipts.

My wife got dinged last year when the lab work at the hospital where her in network doctor works wasn't in the network. $500 error! You lose the healthcare game! Try again next week
My boyfriend is going through this right now. He needs to take part in a sleep study. His snoring has become out of control and his keep both of us from getting the sleep we need to the point it is taking a severe toll on our relationship and working lives.  He got a recommendation from his therapist. His insurance company does work with the recommended doctor however his specific plan (and it is one of the top plans his work offers) doesn‚Äôt cover the doctor.  So the doctor work with his insurance company, but he doesn‚Äôt have the right plan with his insurance company to see the doctor. What the actual fuck is the point of private insurance? (I know, I know, profit)
It doesn't matter anyway.  I've had a couple of surgeries in the last two years, I spent hours and hours asking if everyone was in my network, to please tell me how much my insurance would cover and how much I'd be on the hook for.  They all told me that was impossible to know until after we did the procedure, we did, because it's not like I had a choice, and found out a month later than the anesthesiologist was out of network, even though the hospital and everyone else was in-network, so I got stuck with a $2,000 bill in spite of me having one of those "cadillac" insurance plans.  The worst part is that the bulk of it wasn't even because of the anesthesiologist, his fee was actually sensible, these motherfuckers up-charged me 500% for a two little plastic stents.  The healthcare system is bullshit.
I remember when I got a list of a certain type of specalists in my network and in my area. Most weren't taking new patients and at least 20% of the list had dead numbers on it. Then when I finally went to the doctor they told me I was using the old list and that I was out of network EVEN THOUGH THEY SENT ME THAT LIST.
I changed my son's primary care doctor to one closer to our new home.  Apparently I also changed his network without realizing so when I tried taking him to Urgent Care last week I was turned away because it wasn't in network.  It was very frustrating because I used the website where my insurance was entered to find the Urgent Care facility & it didn't say anything about being out of network.
Obama: "I'm absolutely confident that for two years if every nation on earth was run by women, you would see a significant improvement across the board on just about everything. If you look at the world and look at the problems, it's usually old men not getting out of the way."
thanks Obama
He also said, "Democrats aren‚Äôt just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, they‚Äôre running on good new ideas like Medicare for all, giving workers seats on corporate boards, reversing the most egregious corporate tax cuts to make sure college students graduate debt-free,‚Äù  [https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-obama-medicare-for-all-20180911-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-obama-medicare-for-all-20180911-story.html)  Sounds to me like he is signaling his support for Warren.
Hypothetically yeah, but then I think about Republican women and my soul shrivels like a flaccid dick  imagine any Republican woman senator running shit they're no better
It is unquestionable to me President Obama is both an extremely cerebral and pragmatic man who thinks very deeply before he speaks.  I would be wary of reading this as an endorsement of Sen Warren but he's not foolish enough to think it won't be interpreted through the lens of the primary. Either he's making up for his earlier remarks on going too far to the left or at the very least he's doesn't mind that it will be seen as positive to Sen Warren.  One other thing about the President. This is a man who listens, thinks and then acts for the general good. He is not a Bush who railroaded his agenda from day 1 and never deviated. Obama thrives on information and makes up his mind based on what he knows when the decision is due. Sometimes those decisions are good in retrospect, sometimes not. But I cannot accuse him of not seeking to challenge his own assumptions and doing what he thought was right. Anyone who tries to paint Obama as one-dimensional will fail.
That sounds like a very soft endorsement.  As long as he's not putting his chips behind Biden, I'm happy.

I posted this in r/politics and it got removed as **OFF TOPIC**.
That‚Äôs pretty pointed. The news is trying to discount it by saying ‚Äúwell, it was in a foreign country, etc etc‚Äù. But he strikes me as someone who knows that it doesn‚Äôt matter where he is when he says something, it‚Äôs always going to get noticed. So I don‚Äôt think you can deny that he‚Äôs telling the old men to get out of the race.   What the location does is remove any other potential message than the exact words he said.
Just endorse, damn.  The trolls are going to call Duh System rigged no matter who wins the primary
Obama endorses Warren for president!
Then why did he run against Hillary in 08? genuinely curious how those two train of thoughts go about
Sarah Palin?  Susan Collins?  Margaret Thatcher??  I'm a woman, and I liked Obama, but can we please make this about competent people and not just women...because, you know, there are GOP women.  (Why, I don't know but still...)
Is this him explaining away why he didnt change more? He just needed some ovaries and he wouldve raised taxes on the wealthy, ended our forever wars, and held firm with unions?  Im sorry but one of the reasons Liz is great is she understands the problems are STRUCTURAL. Its not just about having decent people in positions of power, the way the entire system works has to change.
Wow, this is actually fantastic news. If Liz wanted to take Biden down a few pegs she can totally throw this out in the next debate.
Sounds like a subtle hint about Biden.
What he says and what he did: two different things.
I'd rather have a world ran by any Democrats than one ran by Republican women
When in history has there ever been a war with 2 female rulers on opposing sides?
Obama will not be endorsing any candidate until after they‚Äôve won the nomination. Despite his overwhelming support for Clinton, he didn‚Äôt endorse her until after she had beaten Sanders

And how is this shit not sexism?
He should know.
I would love to know what Obama thinks of "The Power," which was one of his best books of 2017.
*cough* damn. I hadn't seen the whole quote until now
You‚Äôre retired, Barry. There‚Äôs no need to pander anymore.
Look at the Alabama abortion ban. Signed into law by a women. If you dont change the system it won't matter whos in charge.
Obama displaying the subtle sexism of low expectations.
If that is truly how he feels, why didn't he concede to Hillary?
Thanks Obama, would also love a leader who stops droning third world countries and doesn‚Äôt expand the military budget like every president before them, whatever gender
This is why Bernie will fail.
Women should have a chance. Surely men have had their way for long enough. I think it‚Äôs time.

I thought Obama was recently criticizing Sanders and Warren for their hardline on Medicare.
Long live Marine Le Pen!  Gender is not everything Barack. I'm offended as a man, seriously.  Edit: Why the downvotes? If the female candidate wins in France, things are not going to get better. That's a fact. Barack is literally being sexist here.
[removed]
That's sexist.
Lol Andrew Yang had a solid comment about this in the last debate  [his response](https://youtu.be/ad0nvfNGP2M)
Piss off obombya.
Take that joe Biden!!
[removed]
Just to be clear, this quote is from over a year ago, and should not really be taken as any kind of comment on the current primary.
Obama won't endorse or signal support for any candidate. He'll just endorse whoever comes out of the primary
Couldn‚Äôt he also be supporting Sanders with this comment?  Sounds like he‚Äôs pushing for a more progressive agenda in general.
I love Warren but so far female politicians are just as shitty as male politicians which in a way is great because it shows that women are just as capable as men üòú
If anything this recent comments would probably see him aligning with Biden, Pete, or Amy because they're not swinging so far left they're alienating voters   https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/politics/obama-warns-2020-candidates-reality/index.html
Or just read anything about Margaret Thatcher  Conservative Women are like Cop Women: Consistently under great pressure to demonstrate that they aren't weak, usually resulting in them being more draconian than their male counterparts
This quote was over a year ago and more likely a throw back to Bernie & Trump vs Clinton
Kind of a sticky wicket for him, isn't it?  I know he discouraged Biden from running but he probably doesn't want the narrative in the media to be "Obama rejects his VP for president" and all that shit.  Honestly, I can understand him not wanting to jump in; it'll be endless talk about why he chose this person over that, which can derail from the issues at hand (at least for a little while longer).
Yeah, I always cringe at statements like the one Obama made here.  Take England for example. Theresa May and Margaret Thatcher were just as bad as male conservative leaders. The problem is that a lot of women and minorities who would make great leaders don't get the chance to do so because of the biases against them. But being a female or minority in leadership doesn't automatically make someone better.  Warren would be an improvement over Trump because she's a better person and leader than Trump. Not because she's female.
Exactly. My support for her has nothing to do with her being a woman. I just think she's going to try to do her best to make America a better place to live for most people. That's all I want from a candidate.
Sure but her being a woman is a massive bonus. We need to break that topmost glass ceiling and until we do, we're telling women in our society that there are things we just won't let them do.
I think Obama is just stating a realty that few us get to see. When I took a Business Management course a few years back, the course and the materials had women scoring higher in every meaningful management metric. Whether it was communication, organization,  prioritization of business goals, empathy, professional development of directs, etc etc. They were just better managers across the board. How do you square all that with women not having as much representation in upper management and political office?
Counterpoint - Female candidates that appear equally meritorious to man candidates are actually much stronger because of all the invisible obstacles they had to overcome to reach the same place as a man.  Being an accomplished female in a patriarchal system should absolutely be a positive trait just as any accomplishment in the face of adversity should be.
Counterpoint: start thinking about being a woman as a meritorious quality.
The patriarchy is in full effect at /r/politics   I recently pointed out how there has been 45 male POTUS and zero female POTUS and that I have a desire to see that inequality decrease, and I was called sexist.  I was called sexist for advocating that women should have this thing that men have had for two hundred some odd years.
You really think Obama will endorse anyone other than a Biden-style centrist?
The system is rigged though. There's verifiable proof that certain candidates, the more progressive ones, get less coverage by the media, and more negative media coverage than the centrist democratic candidates.
You're really giving all those "We're going to make Obama a one term president" Republicans a pass. The guy tried to give people affordable healthcare and people called him the fucking anti-christ...
How is that your interpretation of these words
Good lord I am tired of people rewritting 2008-2016 as some sort of tragedy. President Obama delivered the left a shit ton of monumental successes and did so on top of a Republican Congress that was obstructionist to a degree lightyears beyond anything any other Democrat had faced in a century. AND this was on top of coming into office during (not after) the biggest existential threat to the global economy in the last century. So, world on the brink of disaster and opposition trying to stop anything/everything he wants to pass. How did he do?   Obama:  Reversed 'global gag rule', allowing US aid to go to organizations regardless of whether they provide abortions  Pulled troops out of Iraq and drew down troop numbers in Afghanistan. Reversed the policy of barring media coverage during the return of fallen soldiers to Dover Air Force Base  Appointed two very liberal supreme court justices including the first Latina.  Passed the largest healthcare overhaul since medicare.  Oversaw a radical shift in the treatment of LGBTQ people by extending benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees and ended Don't Ask Don't Tell. He was the first president to endorse same-sex marriage equality and gay marriage was legalized under his watch.  Appointed more openly gay officials than any other president in US history  He ended the fucking 2008 recession without millions of people losing their jobs like predicted. And created more private sector jobs in 2010 than during entire Bush years  Oversaw passage of the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking reforms which among other things prohibited banks from engaging in proprietary trading (trading the bank's own money to turn a profit, often in conflict with their customers' interests)  He raised fuel efficiency standards to get us cleaner cars and enacted a clean power plan to cut national emissions.  He ratified the Paris climate accords.  Provided $12.2 Billion in new funding for Individuals With Disabilities Education Act  Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco for the first time  Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination for women and other workers  Signed the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act, which provides health care to 11 million kids -- 4 million of whom were previously uninsured  Issued executive order to repeal Bush era restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research  Signed the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, the first piece of comprehensive legislation aimed at improving the lives of Americans living with paralysis   Signed the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act to stop fraud and wasteful spending in the defense procurement and contracting system.   Stopped police from obtaining military grade arsenals.  There's a lot more:  http://whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar.com/
Sounds like Bernie needs some Ovaries because this has been his exact platform for years if not decades
Obama was the president that drove the GOP to their current state of 'we will block everything if we don't get our way'. He also had to deal with prevent a recession and help prevent a global economic collapse.   Without the changes Obama made, in spite of republican obstruction, Liz and Bernie would be joke candidates.
https://qz.com/967895/throughout-history-women-rulers-were-more-likely-to-wage-war-than-men/  TL:DR - Isabella was a beast. Female rulers are less likely to trust anyone and more likely to view subordinates as pawns since they rarely lead from the front.
Because he wanted to be President.
Hillary has never had a real chance of winning the presidency. She isn't charismatic enough.
A few Quick Questions:  Which branch of government controls the military's budget?  Coming off of a near decade of war in the same two foreign countries, what was the general public view of troops on the ground versus assets in the air at the time?  Bonus question is what happened to the region when we drastically stepped down *both* troops on the ground *and* assets in the air?

True. They should replace the word ‚Äúwomen‚Äù with the working class.
Bad women being worse than good men is not the calculation.  It's whether Obama broadly believes that women in general would make better leaders.  All this talk of individual conservative or outright evil women as if they're counterexamples ignores that, whether due to opportunity or something else, there are many male leaders, both in power now and throughout history, that are *significantly* worse.
Bernie's stood for what's right, sure, but the one who actually got more progressive things *done* (in a shorter period of time, too) is Liz.

Though to also be clear, the Submitted BBC article IS from today.
no lol, it‚Äôs an old quote and he made a comment the other week saying we need to stop being so far left
Is he a woman?
considering:       >Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him.   [Waiting for Obama](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2019/11/26/barack-obama-2020-democrats-candidates-biden-073025)    \- Politico  I'm going to go with... No.
I might have to disagree with you until you can show me a lawsuit which alleges any woman in politics has ever raped a 13 year old, or looked away while their students were molested by a doctor habitually, or used their campaign funds to buy private flights for their various affairs, and then blamed it on their husband and children before eventually pleading guilty.
The comment about women happened today or yesterday.
Yeah, but that's because they are still the minority among a bunch of men.  What if half the Senate was Collins instead?
I've said this earlier in the thread but I guess it needs restating, you're underestimating in a most unfashionable manner the incredible reselliance of many of the women leaders west has had since Thatcher -who like it or not, single handedly proved to demographics which for centuries have disparaged women as leaders or even breadwinners for the first time since good queen Bess that women were just as decisive, visionary, and damn determined (good or ill) leaders as men were particularly in facing down Argentina and Arthur Scargill who the previous four PMs backed down and caved to both.    To progressives she was just another conservative monster who didn't put enough women in her cabinet or campaign for feminism, but to the British (white) working class she restored a national pride they've long forgotten they had and to leaders across the globe proved so formidable an adversary they did what they could to make sure they never had to face her down.    We can say she shipped the jobs away and was cruel to close down a ton of coal mines, but it's simply disrespectful to the history of women to deny she began the strong trend of women premiereship in the western world and Hillary simply wouldn't have been running in 2008 or 2016 without that in place. It's just beyond undeniable what an incredible impact she had on british national politics and the international landscape.     Just please watch the recent BBC series from earlier this year on Thatcher as PM and do some right proper research, it's really resulted in a change of heart on my part and overall opinion of the bigger picture in ways that has surprised. It really helps when you aren't looking through a uniquely modern lens of more right leaning party in country=bad guys and more left leaning pary=good guys which does a huge disservice to anyones ability to evaluate a historical context.      I understand- trust me, our approach to the world -shaped by ideological predispositions built into us from our college years like an old trusty whetstone and a now seemingly perfectly serviced sword took me *a long while* to shake off for even just brief moments when surveying historical contexts quite different to our own, but was honedtly absolutely worth it. I suggest by getting your foot in the water in the water with less divisive figures like Angela Merkel and going from there. It also helps to use certain issues important to you with similar arguments over time as anchor points. For instance- the shutting down of coal mines in favor of better energy sources. Conservatives used to demand it to modernize  the country, while progressives once staunchly opposed it at all costs. Why? It's fascinating to investigate with a clear head! Regardless you'll likely find like me your mind isn't changed much about the present politics, but it does become much harder without revisions clouding one's judgement by way of good vs. evil narratives to think of your fellow countrymen as stupid or brainwashed and easier to understand the past conditions and changes which set in motion their current mode of thought. I found this to be a healthy adjustment.
The quote is recent.
I don't think you can be much clearer than saying "old men should get out of the way and let women lead for a while."
According to the Politico article he wanted a standard bearer to organically materialize without outside influence/putting his thumb on the scale. He also had critiques for every candidate on their weaknesses in his view and told them. So it's like he just went full blown yoda after the B.S he went through.      He seems to have settled on Political Darwinism being the best way forward.
Did he really discourage Biden from running? Where'd you hear that?
How do you know he discouraged Biden from running? I do not trust the veracity of that reporting from the NYT.  I believe it‚Äôs an attempt to divide Dems
I agree, the reverse sexism stuff is always cringey. I‚Äôm honestly surprised to hear it coming from Obama.  If we were to be generous to his comment though, we might interpret it to mean that the lived experiences of being a woman are underrepresented in leadership across the world, and that just giving voice to those would inherently make the world a better place.  That said, when evaluating individual candidates for office, platform and track record rank much higher for me than demographic.
Thatcher -like it or not, single handedly proved to demographics which for centuries have disparaged women as leaders or even breadwinners for the first time since good queen Bess that women were just as decisive, visionary, and damn determined (good or ill) leaders as men were particularly in facing down Argentina and Arthur Scargill who the previous four PMs backed down and caved to both.

Nothing automatically makes someone better - it's all about evidence. Accomplishments are evidence for a person's merit and quality.  Making an accomplishment as a female is harder than a male due to endemic sexism and invisible barriers.  Therefore, being female should increase your assessment of the impressiveness of any accomplishments made.
I would still be supporting Warren if she was a he. But that she is a she shore is a shell of a plus.  (Bailey too!  ^woof!)
I've got to say, r/politics is typically pretty good, but every now and again the same ugly racism, sexism, and homophobia you see in the rest of reddit rears its ugly head there.
I mean I can see where they‚Äôre coming from, choosing a candidate for the fact they are one gender is wrong in any case.
Yes.  I think Obama is much more progressive than you give him credit for, but he lacks the boldness of Warren and Sanders, instead favoring incremental steps toward progress. Which is understandable IMO, given how much political capital was expended just to pass the Affordable Care Act.
Obama will endorse the person who becomes the nominee. And if you want that person to be your preferred candidate, it would serve you well to bring a more persuasive case to the table than just calling your competitors ‚Äòcentrists‚Äô and then being done with it.
Republican obstructionism was horrible but Obamas instincts in a few areas were bad. He wanted entitlement reform bad and we're lucky he never got it. He and Joe also made like 90% of the Bush tax cuts permanent in a deal that went over Harry Reids head. To blame the mistakes of the Obama years solely on Republican obstructionism is a mistake.   But my original point is Obama seems to be making the statement that if only old white men werent in power then everything would be hunky dory, when in fact you would just have women at the helm of an american system thats completely dysfunctional and rotting.
Unlike the psychopaths who support a malignant narcissist, most of us ‚Äúon the left,‚Äù feel perfectly comfortable criticizing whomever occupies the presidency.
Obama is basically why I don‚Äôt trust corporate centrist leadership in this era.  He was insanely talented but his leadership style is powerless against McConnel‚Äôs scorched-earth obstructionism and the sacking of our treasury by modern robber barons.  We need an anti-corruption candidate with a New Deal mindset for the modern age.
Huh?
Cool. He also didnt even TRY half of what he campaigned on. And much of what you list here is either good stuff that doesnt address underlying structural issues, or something nice that has in the meantime been completely washed away by Trump executive orders.  Also, wouldnt it have been cool if he threw bankers in jail? You know, the ones that tanked our economy in the first place? That would be really cool.   Im not saying Obama was the worst president ever or even *BAD*. But he did fail to restructure our corrput crony capitalist system. Whats far far worse is he never really tried and let citigroup essentially pick his cabinet.  Obama had an absolute sea of organizers he couldve called upon nation wide to try to drum up support for dems so that they didnt lose their supermajority in 2010. Instead he dissolved O4A and the DNC ran the party 1000 seats into the dirt.   Obama isnt a villain but to point out all the good things he did doesnt diminish the failures he had.
Warren was the first major party candidate to call for ending student debt.   She was also the first candidate to call for workers on corporate boards.
Church.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict that the Simpsons have accurately predicted that Elizabeth Warren will, in fact, be elected to clean up a number of messes, Trump's presidency not least among them.
They called her Lisa Simpson as a diss in one of those nasty Jacobin articles. I like this reclaiming of it.
[deleted]
There is no one more Lisa Simpson in politics than Elizabeth Warren lmao
This had better not be the first Simpsons prediction failure.
Warren is the most Lisa Simpson candidate we‚Äôve ever had. And that‚Äôs a great thing.
 E-Lisa-Beth Warren?
I‚Äôm a bernie supporter but if you look back in history the Simpsons have predicted a lot. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all.
It's REALLY not clairvoyance to predict a Democrat will have to fix a very deeply harmed US after a Republican presidency. I'm surprised it's not their slogan at this point.
r/simpsonsdidit
The Simpsons did it first.
Iv been telling people this for days üòÖü§£
Originally I thought the Simpsons were predicting Hillary back in 2016 but now i think it could clearly mean Elizabeth!  As a 2016 Hillary supporter, a 2020 Liz Warren supporter and a Simpsons fan, I love this.
Sounds good to me. I love Warren.
Warren failed 2nd grade PE. She will be banished to Monster Island. Don't worry, it's just a name.
Let's fucking hope so.
Frankly I trust this more than I trust any poll, pundit, or betting market (though those ain't too shabby at the moment either).
The whole damn system is wrong!
Simpsons did it!
Who is her Millhouse?
Can we just try an intelligent woman as president please? I love Bernie and Obama but we need REAL change. All men already know this from locker room talk and guy talk, and I‚Äôm here to confirm it to you ladies, that most of the time, men cannot compare to women when it comes to empathy and that‚Äôs what we really need in our leadership is empathy if we are to tackle the national and global issues we face now and far into the future. I say most of the time because I know I have the gift of empathy and a few of my guy friends are cool in that regard but so many men don‚Äôt get it and it‚Äôs super frustrating when talking about politics and society with them. Both genders can vary and we all have a lot to offer but right now what we need is a matriarchy. The entire fate of the world depends on it. Go Warren! We need you!!!

I would be honored to be compared to Lisa Simpson, But hey, Jacobin is gonna Jacobin
I really don‚Äôt get why they think that‚Äôs a bad thing, considering Lisa is by far the smartest and most ethical character on the show. Plus she does indeed canonically become President right after Trump, so this is kind of a self-own on their part.
Stonecutters?
Funny story, I have a novel series idea that is about the ultimate secret society of puppeteers who manipulate society, maybe I'll try a jokey style future prophesy that suggests this group intentionally manipulated Trump into office just to fire up and unite the left to elect Warren to drive forward an agenda that saves the planet.
India better not nuke Pakistan like that Krusty joke
WOAH
The episode aired in 2000 though.
Her first husband.
Maybe in your standup routine you could expound more on the differences between men and women. I just know there‚Äôs a goldmine there!
I don't know what all this is, but I'm going to let it be.
I think you should always vote on platform over gender, race, and sex. Policy over appearance. Warren is my #2, I am voting for Bernie because his policy is more progressive and he has always been on the right side of history. Think we need more Democratic Socialists in the White House instead of capitalists.
(Edit: y‚Äôall this is a copypasta joke for the trolly comment chillax.)  I just downvoted your comment.  ###**FAQ**  What does this mean?  The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.  ###**Why did you do this?**  There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma.

[She just matched Biden in the RCP polling average](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) (first and only candidate to do so) and has been [the odds-on favorite to be the Democratic nominee in prediction markets for weeks now](https://electionbettingodds.com/DemPrimary2020.html#chart).
Whoa what? I‚Äôm screenshotting this and getting back to you in 12 months. I think she will win. If Warren doesn‚Äôt win it‚Äôs gonna be Biden. There is 0% chance Bernie wins the nomination. 0% chance. Take this as a bet.
It‚Äôs a joke. We‚Äôre allowed to have a laugh sometimes, especially when we have a president who undermines democracy and is unwilling to accept the laws of the constitution.
I love Lisa Simpson. These idiots are proud to be Homer. They aspire to be Montgomery Burns.
I expect nothing but even handed ness and quality from a magazine named after a political faction best known for beheading its political opponents, starting a bunch of wars, beheading their own generals, then beheading most of its own members.
Start labeling that publication alt-left. They have written so much slanderous bullshit. It's crazy that the pregnancy slur was written by the Free Beacon and the Jacobin. They would do anything to support a certain candidate rather than fight for women's rights. Their party is the DSA; not the Democrats.    >Citing records‚Äînamely, minutes from an April 1971 Riverdale Board of Education meeting‚Äî**the conservative Washington Free Beacon reported on Monday** that Warren‚Äôs second-year teaching contract was approved, but two months later, in a June board meeting, members accepted Warren‚Äôs resignation ‚Äúwith regret.‚Äù Separately, Meagan Day, a **writer for the Democratic socialist quarterly Jacobin (both Day and Jacobin support [REDACTED]) suggested on Twitter that Warren** had changed the details of her departure, pointing to a 2007 academic interview in which Warren, then a Harvard Law professor, indicates she left on her own.  https://www.vogue.com/article/elizabeth-warren-pregnancy-dismissal?verso=true
They may have just misspelled their name, replacing an F with a B ...
I'm a progressive and I'm considering supporting Warren.  If Warren followers dislike Jacobin, and use terms like "alt-left", then I think I may have to reconsider my support.  Clearly, I as a 57 year old female progressive, may be in the wrong place.  Am I?   Do you feel it would be better for me to stay in my "alt-left" lane, the lane that wants M4A, a Green New Deal, Free College, etc.     I mean, if the tone of this sub is to deride people like me, then perhaps my vote isn't needed.  Just let me know.
The best part of that ep is when Homer tries to save Lenny‚Äôs life by knocking the egg sandwich out his hand, but Lenny points out that science has not conclusively proven that dietary cholesterol raises serum cholesterol, *which is still true like 25 years later!*
[deleted]
What happened after that? Not a big Simpsons watcher tbh
I'm not sure what you mean.
Just me saying what I think. I thought that was what reddit was for. Apparently I need to use memes and internet lingo and can‚Äôt speak like I would in person to a friend or I get called a weirdo. Seems pretty disingenuous to me but that‚Äôs the internet üëçüèª
Wrong i like bernie he has a chance. That being said Warren does too. There‚Äôs no way Biden is winning. When they asked him that question about racial inequality he started talking about record players and a bunch of irrelevant crap.

And Trump is basically Mr. Burns with Homer‚Äôs intelligence.
Full disclosure, my dad always called me "Lisa Simpson" when I got good grades, so I consider it a term of endearment
You think jacobin is homer aspiring to be mr burns?
Don‚Äôt even call them alt-left.  Call them a shitty source like Project Veritas or the NY Post.
I never said anything about alt-left and I certainly dont intend to make anyone feel unwelcome.  Jacobin does tend to spread misinformation and is incredibly biased against Elizabeth Warren. This is an Elizabeth Warren subreddit so you can imagine that people here might not like that  Your vote is needed and I think you'll find that the overall vibe of this sub is very positive.  I'm not a mod, but I think I speak for everyone here when I say that you are welcome at r/Elizabethwarren
Does it concern you the level of misogyny among so many men on the left? I expect it from right wingers, but find very frustrating the level of rage many lefty men have towards women. Whatever happened to intersectional support for progress, empowerment and individual dignity, is what I want to ask so many angry lefty men who have so much deep-seated anger and discomfort towards women.
One of those egg council creeps got to you too
Itchy-Hillary 2008  They aint prophets.
As Lisa is president he just offhandedly makes a joke about how India recently nuked Pakistan ("What's the difference between a Pakistan and a pancake? I don't know any pancakes that were recently nuked by India!") and no one laughs and then he goes "What, too soon?" implying it had just happened just before the start of Lisa's term  That's it. It's just a throwaway joke. I hope
It sounded like you thought this episode aired recently, but it aired in the year 2000.
Do you really think Sanders‚Äô numbers are going to go up after just having a heart attack at 78 years old on the campaign trail.  Before you explode in rage, I voted for Sanders in my states primary in ‚Äò16.
Personally, I need to still be able to find happiness and laughter during times like this. That‚Äôs how I cope. I can‚Äôt roil in anger or sadness all day long. At work, at home, out with family and friends, online, etc. Sometimes I want to be able to take a moment away from everything, enjoy silly memes, take a deep breath, and keep charging forward.
I‚Äôve been calling Lindsey Graham Smithers for awhile.
 I I meant trump supporters.  And trump.
I call them the dirtbag left.
> Does it concern you the level of misogyny among so many men on the left?    I'm not sure what misogyny you are referring to?  Our movement centers all marginalized groups, and many of our legislators and public figures are women of color.    Of course, as a member of the loathed "alt left" I have been called so many awful things, I've lost track.  I used to keep a list.
I'm aware of when it aired, I remember watching it.  What I'm saying is that in the year 2000, it was already a well established pattern that a disastrous Republican presidency would be followed by a Democrat who'd need to put the country back together.
Noo but he‚Äôs actually running on more than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Trump!‚Äù Which is all what Biden‚Äôs campaign is based on.
Life is serious enough as it is. If we can't laugh, what else do we have?
[deleted]
Ah! Makes sense now.
You'll need the votes of the Dirt Bag left, so you might want to dial down the hostility.  Unless, you prefer to chase centrist voters.
As a lefty man myself, I‚Äôm referring to the very high degree of hostility toward women, especially women candidates, I have noticed in dialoguing about politics with many, many men who join us in favoring progressive policies. Many of them are very progressive on economics and environmental issues, but have a deep-seated loathing for progressive, powerful women. I‚Äôve seen it more times than I can count, and frankly find it disgusting. By no means is it all men on the left, but it is quite a large number. Are you suggesting you have not seen this at all, ever? No lefty men hostile to women? Have you not seen some of the invective hurled at Elizabeth, who is very progressive? I see it even with AOC, which I just shake my head at.
I‚Äôm not for Biden, which is why I‚Äôm here and asking.
Moooommm people are having fun on the Internet!
I ain‚Äôt going to grant anyone more respect than they will grant a reasonable presidential candidate.  If they go out of their way to demean and put her down, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be coming to the table anyways.
Chasing liars and conspiracy theorists for votes is what turned the Republican party into what it is now.  If insulting Jacobin after they do the same thing as the sleazy conservative media feels insulting to you personally, maybe you should consider why you're associating yourself with that.
They aren't gonna vote for Warren. They hate her and actually think she is a corporate puppet
I'd rather have centrists than the Dirtbag left. Shitty people exist in every ideology.
No, I haven't.  I guess you must be mortified that Nancy Pelosi and the establishment wing of the party are endorsing a candidate who has received $$ from the NRA and is anti-choice?  As a woman, that concerns me greatly.   [https://www.newsweek.com/nancy-pelosi-endorses-nra-backed-texas-incumbent-against-progressive-democratic-challenger-1462147](https://www.newsweek.com/nancy-pelosi-endorses-nra-backed-texas-incumbent-against-progressive-democratic-challenger-1462147)
Well the other person said if Warren doesn‚Äôt win then the nominee would be Biden. I said there‚Äôs no way Bernie won‚Äôt be the nominee but Biden will. Now hella people are pissed at me.
Make them stooooop!
[deleted]
>they go out of their way to demean and put her down  So you don't welcome a policy-oriented debate between two progressives?
First I‚Äôve heard of it, thanks for letting me know. I guess their logic is that that may be the best candidate they can get in that district, but no, that does not warm my heart. Why would it? Do you somehow think it would?  And what does it have to do with many lefty men having hostility towards women and their needs and rights and your refusal to acknowledge that fact?
Gotcha. I like Sanders, I‚Äôm just not sure he‚Äôll be able to recover getting the nomination after having a heart attack on the campaign.
Nobody thinks you do buddy
>And what does it have to do with many lefty men having hostility towards women and their needs and rights and your refusal to acknowledge that fact?  Sorry, I haven't seen it.  Quite the reverse.  Why do you try to make me agree to something I don't agree with?

You can not feel like laughing. Just don‚Äôt be mad that others want to. It‚Äôs not hard.
Jack Black joins #TeamWarren!
Some on Twitter have pointed out the extremely problematic history of Mt. Rushmore, prompting @Millys4Warren to remove their tweet with this image and [share history about the mountain and the misdeeds of the federal government related to it](https://twitter.com/Millys4Warren/status/1229528723310960640).  We're not going to take this down, as I don't think Jack Black or the shirt artist chose this image maliciously, and this is better as a shared expression of support and a learning opportunity, but I do appreciate @Millys4Warren's choice and encourage people to read their thread.
Yea!  We need humor introduced into the campaign!
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not hardcore, unless you live hardcore‚Äù

We need more endorsements like this! As much as endorsements from academia, nonprofits, and political organizations are important we need endorsements from artists and influential people as well!
That‚Äôs awesome! Doesn‚Äôt seem like an official endorsement but it‚Äôs as close as a celeb will get without saying it out loud I guess. I‚Äôll take it and I hope he rocks his support/this shirt everywhere
This made my day. Omg this is amaaaaaazing <3!!!!!!!!
Damn that's a glorious beard and a sweet shirt
That‚Äôs awesome
Fuck ya!
Nice!!!
This is a tribute!
omg that is so sweet. I love Jack Black.
Yahoo jabloney!
I get why they would want to delete that after the other non-scandal scandal.
This isn‚Äôt an endorsement, it‚Äôs just a tribute.
We all joined. Few of us got social media exposure.

I didn't know the history untill the Twitter thread and I would consider myself reasonably well read.
Yeah Mount Rushmore is an almost comically bad look for us....
Is that the name of the Jack Black shirt?
Thanks for posting that, I probably should have done that rather than just yelling lyrics in all-caps
Count me among them, that twitter thread in the sticky was an unpleasant wakeup call.
please read up on mt. rushmore‚Äôs history and take a moment to reflect on why it‚Äôs in especially bad taste in the context of warren‚Äôs track record with native peoples
ohhhh.. this was the part where a 17 year old is dropping knowledge on me about what they just learned in American History class. You're right. I'm sure native Americans everywhere are super insulted about that shirt.   My mom grew up on Fort Peck Assiniboine & Sioux Tribes reservation in Polar Montana. I worked on the Miccosukee Indian reservation in Florida in highschool, then went to Florida State University when a bunch of edgy white people tried to claim the "Seminoles" mascot was racist and insulting to the tribe (even though the university and tribe worked hand-in-hand for over 70 years to preserve and honor the imagery, history, and culture). So this isn't the first time I've seen fake and ignorant outrage by people that don't know what they're talking about. Par the course all my life.
Warren sent us a note!
We sent her a birthday card and notice of how much we raised for her‚Äîand she sent us this!  Let‚Äôs show her some more love and [donate here](http://bit.ly/reddit-for-warren)!

when is the AMA
Wait this is about us
This warms my heart. Needed some cheering today.
what a class act. kudos to you cats for organizing that birthday card in the first place.
She‚Äôs just a nice lady. This is *awesome.
We persist. That‚Äôs what my Warren tshirt says, after all.
I just stared volunteering on her campaign. I'd love to meet her one day.
Yeah! That is awesome :-)

Erm I‚Äôve interned in DC for a congressman, their staff signs those letters

Really curious if she‚Äôs fight one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses.
Ill be seeing her in LA next week. I can try to ask if she'll be up for an AMA
Is there way to get a notification of a AMA?  If someone else gets to before I do. I‚Äôd like to inquire lower overtime taxes. It would directly impact the middle class and encourage many to work the extra hours, producing more products that would generate more sales tax.
yup üòâ
Holy shit we did something!!!!

This is literally step-by-step how you get a selfie.  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-selfies.html
Girl you really think that ELIZABETH WARREN, the lady who spends hours on the phone talking to random supporters, wouldn't sign a letter before it went off?
Agreed. I want to know what happens to my predatory loans once ursury laws are reinstated.
I think we have to ask ourselves, who is profiting from this fight?  It's not Elizabeth Warren, the duck, or the horses.  This is just a ploy to divide them while Wall Street and Big Business continue to take a greater and greater share of the pie.
More curious if she has a plan for both
Asking the important questions here!
>Really curious if she‚Äôd fight one horse-sized duck  *Oof*, my mind read that very wrong the first time through....
But don't we want to encourage better work-life balance? Pay people so that they don't feel like they need to work overtime often? While at the same time encouraging companies to hire more workers?
Gotta have her come to my state!
That sounds a little more Bernie than Warren.  (I am a fan of Bernie and Warren, and a huge -- yooge! -- fan of them banding together.)  I think Warren is more:  Who is the system working for?  The system's working great for the horse-sized duck.  It gets to run the show.  I'm here to fight for the duck-sized horses, so they can get their fair share instead of all of the profits going to the one horse-sized duck.
Also, we‚Äôre in Florida. Hurricane season is coming up so when a storm hits we are sent out to keep the trucks able to do their jobs. Those are 80+ hour weeks where the last 20 hours are taxed so high we make far less than our base pay while exhausting ourselves.
I agree with you for the most part. However, at my job we have several people that work two jobs because 20hrs of overtime is taxed so much that working 20hrs somewhere else pays more. We aren‚Äôt minimum wage. We repair ambulances and fire trucks. There is endless amount of work but only so much room to do so. So more people doesn‚Äôt necessarily work in our field. Also finding decent people is hard enough at this point.
Yeah, your comment sounds more like Warren! I‚Äôm impressed how close it mirrors her speaking style lol
Ah, you make a good point. And it mostly hurts the worker rather than the employer. Yeah, I remember the 60+ hour weeks thinking I'd be making bank, but it felt like less than expected.
Thank you, and buenas noches, Reddit.  La cosa mas importante es que necesitamos escribir commentarios para todos, no solo para los redditores en /r/lounge.  We have to create an online community that isn't purely built on in-jokes, so that people who are new to our community feel welcome.  Our sub was built by those people, who our top moderator is -- our top moderator is more interested in stoking the downvotes of hatred than bringing us together.
Anything over about 54 hours starts to be a waste of time. But, these counties are already limited on trucks so when one breaks down it only hurts the residents of the county. The sooner a truck can get done and back on the road the better. Could save someone‚Äôs life by working those couple extra hours. But not everyone has that attitude.
I read 100% of this comment in Senator Lipton‚Äôs (The Office) voice
I was aiming for Beto...
_State_ Senator
"Brett Kavanaugh was allowed to be angry. Dr. Ford wasn‚Äôt. Women grow up hearing that being angry makes us unattractive. Well, today, I‚Äôm angry ‚Äì and I own it. I plan to use that anger to take back the House, take back the Senate, & put Democrats in charge. Are you with me?"
This is from 2018 (before we took back the house).  She should just retweet it as a response to Biden.
Legit one of the reasons I like her is cause she never tries to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù.  If she‚Äôs pissed she‚Äôs pissed and she is in fact pissed.
"What's it like to brag about raking in dollars  And getting bitches and models?  And it's all good if you're bad  And it's okay if you're mad     If I was out flashin' my dollas  I'd be a bitch, not a baller  They'd paint me out to be bad  So it's okay that I'm mad"   üñïüèª the patriarchy
Fuck yeah, what a great response. Channel it!
I may be in the minority here, but as a cis gendered white male, y'all right.  Ain't nothing wrong with an angry lady any more than there is with an angry dude.  Y'all kick ass and take what's yours.
apologists are going to go over like a fart in the wind, if you're not mad, you haven't been paying attention. even the average person is mad about *something*. be mad and DO something about it.
Win!! #Warren2020
This is a favorite topic of mine when social expectation comes up. I'm a guy's-girl, and I get a ton of passes as such, but my goodness some men don't get that all other women in their life aren't different than me or even themselves sometimes.
The kicker in all of this is that men ‚Äúaren‚Äôt allowed to cry‚Äù just like women aren‚Äôt allowed to be angry, but Kavanaugh was crying like a 3 year old who lost his ice cream and still got the seat.
Ugh, that first response is so disgusting.  He either knew he was avoiding the point, or completely missed it... either way, what a disgrace to humanity.
I‚Äôm with you, Senator
he was "allowed" to be angry?  wth does that even mean??
Oh, huh. I didn't even read it as an attack on Warren. I saw that as a commentary on the followers of candidates.
So this is not something that EW‚Äôs campaign put out. .....You can tell by the poor quality image. Whoever posted this should tell us where it came from.
I don‚Äôt mind her being angry. I want her to be angry. I just don‚Äôt really believe she is angry.
A little bit out dated, you already have the house might want to fact check.
She did.
What did biden say?
That definitely needs to be one of Warren's campaign songs, if its not already
That reminds me of the Halsey song where she sings about a man telling her to smile and she tells him she doesn't owe him a goddamn thing.
We shouldn‚Äôt be in the minority, it‚Äôs just obvious if you see women as people, it‚Äôs sad that it‚Äôs hard enough by default for so many men to let that bias go
I wonder if things would have gone differently if Dr. Blaise Ford had been unapologetically angry.
If a man gets angry it‚Äôs a righteous anger, or he‚Äôs passionately defending himself. This was the defense for Kavanagh‚Äôs little bitch fit on the stand.  If a woman gets angry she‚Äôs throwing a hissy fit, a tantrum, being shrewish, hysterical, etc...
Do you have a link to that retweet from her toward Biden? I can't find it.

I would love that sooo much!

No. She would have been dismissed as an angry, unattractive woman.
I guess this depends on which race the man is, because there's definitely an "angry black man" stereotype. A passionate defense definitely is perceived as anger in these situations. We see it all the time in sports.
Says...no one? If we look at it from his perspective, if he's been falsely accused of literal rape in public,  on the 12th hour of his confirmation to the Supreme Court... I mean....are you honestly going to tell me that anger isn't justified in that scenario? Pretty heartless thing to say. If Ford was angry, assuming we understand her perspective, that would be reasonable as well. But this tweet is an almost perfect example of cognitive dissonance. Like, she's ignoring all the hate Kavanaugh got for being angry, handwaving it as something he was "allowed" to be... wtf? How about everyone is allowed to feel emotion, and we don't begrudge anyone their emotions when they're justified.
This tweet is speaking about cultural norms in general using this instance as an example, not so much on the specifics of this case and whether it is justified.  US society has a lot of rules about how men and women are "supposed" to act and she is accurate in that anger in women is gets labeled as "being a bitch" or waved away as "it must be that time of the month."  In contrast men that show the same emotion are more likely to be labeled as "courageous", or praised with "he's a fighter".    It goes the other way too with men showing their emotions.  Men who show their emotions are said to be "weak", "soft", or "pussies (like women)".    Ultimately, Warren is taking an emotion that would culturally be frowned upon because she's a woman and attempting turning it into a positive as being a fighter/standing up for what is right.
I‚Äôm not saying his anger wasn‚Äôt justified, I‚Äôm saying he displayed it an inappropriate way, demonstrating to the whole world that his impulsive history and temperamental disposition make him unfit to sit on the highest court in the land.
Impulsive history?
Jon Lovett mourns for Warren: "If she were a man, this race wouldn't have been close. But if she were a man, she wouldn't be Elizabeth Warren."
Full quote from Jon:  >I believe Elizabeth Warren would've been an extraordinary President....   >   >*\*Crowd cheers\**   >   >... and that no one thought more deeply about how much good a person can do with the power of presidency - no one!   >   >She did not run a perfect campaign, but you know who also ran imperfect campaigns? Every single human being who got to become President.   >   >**If she were a man, this primary wouldn't have been close. But if she were a man, she wouldn't be Elizabeth Warren.**   >   >*\*Crowd cheers\**   >   >But I say that without feeling confident that that means she should've been the nominee. And when swing state polls consistently showed a tougher race \[for her\] against Trump than either Bernie or Biden, I understood those who might have thought Warren would be the best President but not the best candidate - as frustrating as it has been for her supporters.   >   >So I'm sad and I'm sad because I want to live in an America that doesn't just have a woman President, but that is finally hoenst about misogyny but also about the expectations of masculinity that are woven into every facet of our culture.   >   >But the good news is that we can have that conversation and we can keep having it. And after we get rid of Trump. And until we elect a woman Presdient: **That woman - Elizabeth Warren - whose going to come out of a contested fucking convention...**   >   >*\*Crowd pauses then slowly bursts into cheers\**   >   >**Jon: Contested convention!!!!**   >   >**Crowd: Contested convention!!!**
That episode is pretty much a Warren rallyüòÅ
It‚Äôs been depressing as fuck seeing the sexism at work with how people treated Elizabeth.   That‚Äôs maybe the part I‚Äôm having the hardest time with in the wake of her leaving the race. Just having to face how sexist this country still is and wondering how much longer I have to wait to see a woman as president.
Does anyone know if there's a sub dedicated to electing women in down-ballot races? It's so important that we build this movement from the local level.
Contested convention.  Now that would be interesting if that's the plan.  I had thought that was the plan, but then she dropped.  But what if dropping is part of the plan, now.  As one commentator put it, "Everyone loves Elizabeth Warren again now that she's no longer seeking power.".  So, by dropping people can be honest about how they feel about her again.  A sad admission of misogyny, even among liberals and progressives, but here we are.  I can see either Biden and/or Sanders dropping out at any moment citing health reasons.  What if they both do it at the convention and endorse Warren.  Pipe dream, I know, but that's the only kind of dream I have left.
I‚Äôm mourning for Warren, too.  I just don‚Äôt want another old angry white man for president, Republican or Democrat.  Am I alone?  That said, I will vote blue no matter who.
Alexa play The Man by Taylor Swift.
Read that as Jon Lovitz
Please. These are another group of progressives who sat on the sidelines  One of them had a "brilliant rant" on the Chris Hayes about the worries of a Joe and Bernie candidate and never once brought up Warren. It was widely lauded on social media by fellow and so few saw the irony.  These folks can all miss me with these hottakes.

I kind of feel as though sexism, though a negative factor, was not dispositive in her failure to captivate the Democratic Party.  I think as presented she was just a more intellectually complex candidate than people are used to seeing in modern political discourse - since probably HW was defeated by Clinton.  Hopefully she and other thoughtful politicians will eventually inoculate the ever more educated and intelligent public against simplistic one note messages in the future.

Well I think Biden‚Äôs just going to get an outright majority now but I would cackle for eternity if the contested convention scenario came to be after all this
Is this something that is even remotely possible? Not that I want to get my hopes up again but I kinda do. What would that entail? Can I do anything to make it so?   I can't shake off what she said: fight righteous fights and persist. To me, she is that fight.
Wouldn't that be an interesting prospect.  If neither Biden or Sanders have a majority; and the delegates for both candidates refuse to release their delegates; so they get together and come up with a compromise candidate and that candidate is Elizabeth Warren!  If that actually happened, Sanders supporters might even be on board if Sanders has less delegates than Biden and would have lost regardless.  I think it's a very low probability that this would happen.  However, what if Sanders delegates insist that Biden pick Warren as his VP as a concession, and be able to modify his platform in order to secure the nomination?  That is a more likely scenario.
It sure is!  The whole panel loves Liz so much they might as well have been hand-picked from this sub.
It‚Äôs discouraging to see Warren‚Äôs candidacy undone by the structural sexism that exists in this country. And I say that as an older white dude. She never was given the same megaphone from the press that others were given. The press virtually boycotted her after Iowa and prior to Super Tuesday.  Warren would have been‚Äîand still can be‚Äîa remarkable bridge candidate. I do believe that she would have had the ability to take many of the progressive policies championed by the left but applied a pragmatic, practical approach to actually seeing them implemented. More than that, she could build  and maintain meaningful coalitions with moderates and centrists which is, frankly, necessary to governance.   Warren is remarkable. I wish she would‚Äôve left more ‚Äúblood and teeth on the floor‚Äù (as she stated when creating the CFPB and then subsequently displayed with her evisceration of Michael Bloomberg on live television).  I admire Warren for unapologetically campaigning as a woman, and am simultaneously excited that she was able to inspire so many of the next generation of women leaders. I believe her campaign will begin a lasting and needed conversation around the structural sexism that exists in our politics. And I am grateful that she retains her platform as a United States Senator.   Please don‚Äôt fall into despair. Warren‚Äôs *ideas* haven‚Äôt left the campaign; Warren has not left public service. Somebody mentioned earlier that she should take a prominent role in writing the 2020 platform‚Äîsomething that I can wholeheartedly get behind.  History wasn‚Äôt on our side this time. But political progress is usually measured over decades, not election cycles.  Don‚Äôt give up. *Persist.*
We also saw racism (and the double whammy of racism and misogyny) at play with the early exit of amazingly qualified and competent candidates like Julian Castro, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris.   Why did Pete stay in when other former mayors (of much larger cities and with more wisdom and experience) had to drop out? Why was Kamala attacked on her prosecution history from the get go but we didn't hear about Amy's mistakes until the end?   There's large swaths of the Democratic base who don't want to admit that sexism and racism are still things that limit people's achievements in 2020 because they don't want to believe that liberals and progressives can fall prey to sexist/racist thinking. But here we are with three old white dudes running for president...
One of my coworkers who knew I supported Liz has come to me multiple times in the past week saying things along the lines of "Warren's on her way out." The day after she dropped out he came to me and said "So she dropped, huh? Despite your canvassing efforts, it wasn't enough."  He's my superior so I had to bite my tongue but I reeeeeaaaallllyyyyy wanted to go off. He is the type of guy who just makes decisions about politics based on shallow perceptions without even getting into details and researching the candidates. The only thing he didn't like about Liz was that people wouldn't vote for a woman and the only thing he didn't like about Pete was that people wouldn't vote for a gay man. And that was why he was supporting Joe...but didn't even vote in the primary because his "vote wouldn't matter". I just....cannot.
What sort of sexism? I‚Äôm out of the loop, asking in earnest.  Edit: wtf is wrong with asking a question like this??
You could probably pitch /r/VoteBlue on it
Idk but we need one!

Lol this is peak fanfiction but it feels nice to close my eyes and pretend for a moment.  Maybe we'll have our chance again in 2024!
They‚Äôre both too full of White Male Arrogance ‚Ñ¢ to do any such thing. Hence why we had six women and a ton of mediocre white dudes who thought they could do a better job than the women and poc
This would be such a 9-dimensional chess move... I can almost buy it, cuz if anyone was going to put the pieces together you‚Äôd need to get it done, it would be the smartest person in the room, Sen. Warren.
Her path forward relied on her being the unity candidate nominated at a contested convention. But for that narrative to work, the public perception needs to be that she‚Äôs not the main reason for the contested convention in the first place. Once Bloomberg dropped, I think she realized it just wasn‚Äôt feasible.

I'm tuning out until November, not interested in the primary without Elizabeth.  I think it would help to shift our attention to other down-ballot candidates. Congress is just as important as the presidency - **especially the Senate!**  If Democrats can retake Senate and deprive McConnell of a majority, then that would be just as big of progress as winning the presidency.
Wow that MV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqAJLh9wuZ0  Can you imagine an alternative universe where Elijah Warren and Berniece Sanders are the two progressive candidates? Elijah would've crushed it.
Completely agree with this.  I lost track of the number of progressive Senators who glorified her as the most competent person on the Hill after she dropped but not one of them stuck their neck out when it mattered.  All the dual endorsements.  The organizations that endorsed her 3 hours before Super Tuesday voting started.  Harry fucking Reid.
Lovett was the only one who seemed to be in her corner since last year so I give him some slack. The rest of them - no.
I mean the PSA boys said up front they were going to remain neutral through the primaries and I don‚Äôt fault them for that. They‚Äôre trying to be a podcast for the entire Dem party.   But also it was obvious that they loved Warren.
Because it is mostly a lie.      Here is a response from one of the mods about a month ago on this subject.  &#x200B;     She never claimed Native ancestry in any way that could benefit her. She did put it on a bar registration card, but that was after she was already admitted and for a question that couldn't legally be released to anyone, and noted her ancestry at Harvard only after she already had tenure (basically untouchable). She didn't apply to college as a minority and neither UPenn or Harvard considered her one.

Tulsi Gabbard's only problem is that she is not Elizabeth Warren.
Society is sexist, Dem voters aren't magically excluded. The way we discuss electability is centered around assuming white and male as the default most electable. So people voting on electability are buying into a sexist/racist construct.  I'm not blaming people who are scared for trying to go for the candidate they feel is the safest bet, but how we calculate the safe bet is affected by sexism.
This is, ultimately, a comedy podcast. At times it‚Äôs serious, and driven by serious topics. But the shows are often taped at the Hollywood Improv. So I think it ‚Äúmeans‚Äù that he wanted the audience to have a laugh at a depressing situation. You know, comedy?
I think a lot of it is that everyone is so terrified of losing the election that a lot of people who would have voted for Warren didn‚Äôt because they thought *other people* wouldn‚Äôt vote for a woman.
YES!
This is, more or less, a comedy podcast. It‚Äôs recorded at the Hollywood Improv. So, take it in context.   And honestly at 70 years old, I‚Äôm not sure how she runs again in 2024. I think both Joe and Bernie would want to serve two terms, no?
"People were too stupid for Warren" is definitely a winning angle that you should invest heavily in.  No, one thing I would never accuse her of is having an inaccessible platform. She knew how to communicate it so people could understand.
No, they are racist too.
Oh right, I forgot how they shut down the Bernie sub four years ago when he didn't get the nomination.
 It I thought with Warren gone Sanders was a sure fire victory? /s

Contested convention can only happen if no candidate wins a majority of delegates.  Since there are only two candidates left, one is bound to get over 50% of the delegates, so a contested convention is highly unlikely at this point.  The only way that can happen is if a large chunk of voters in post-Super-Tuesday states collectively decides to vote for a candidate who has dropped out, such that it propels that candidate to become viable by passing the 15% threshold and grab a significant portion of pledged delegates.
Contested convention is at what, like a 10% chance of happening right now, according to 538? Definitely don't get your hopes up though, a contested convention is almost guarenteed to go to Biden if he's plurality delegate leader going in. Which he probably would be.
Lovett or Leave It is a comedy show so no, lol  A contested convention is possible though.
If the remaining delegates are split basically 50-50 for the rest of the primary, technically. That assumes that Bloomberg and Buttigieg don't give their delegates to Biden. If they do, the split is basically Warren's and Gabbard's roughly 65 delegates together and Bernie would need to be winning the rest of the contest by something like 53-47 overall.   I did some napkin math and found that Biden gets a majority with 52% of the remaining delegates and Bernie gets it with 55% of the remaining delegates.
I can't see it happening unless both Biden and Bernie unexpectedly die from the coronavirus, and even then we might get stuck with Bloomberg.
They're really smart and well-informed. Like us.
It's pretty wild that a small town gay mayor had more viability than all the people you listed above.  But being a white man probably helps.
Men don‚Äôt get asked if they‚Äôre likable enough or if they can win because of their gender, just to start.
And I admit as much.  Besides, I doubt either candidate has enough humility to admit she would be a better president.
It may seem like a long time but then I remember how the 2016 general felt like it just happened yesterday.
She was no longer the unity candidate when Bernie supporters scorched the earth against her.  Moderates saw that and noped right out.  Why should they try to unify with someone that the "progressives" call a snake or worse?  Frustrates me to no end that progressives will be the death of the progressive movement with their impossible purity test, and that because so many people have equated this progressive movement with Bernie, that he will be the Alpha and Omega of this current movement.
Nearly 30 million raised in February is dried up?   And I don't buy the narrative that she was continuing to pull Bernie supporters.  I think by Super Tuesday Sanders has already pulled all he was going to from Warren, hence her less than desired showing.  I'm of the mind that her pulling out just handed Biden the nomination.  I could be wrong, but I think Sanders is at his ceiling.  https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/485366-warren-says-she-raised-29-million-in-february?amp
Omg I love the names you picked for them. Yeah and Elijah would be the one most likely to become the nominee and Joe Biden (still the same name) wouldn't even have a chance. Also dude Taylor Swift freaks me out so much and the behind the scenes video she just posted it doesn't help because she sounds like her normal self but looks like a totally different person. I'm surprised I haven't had a nightmare with dude Taylor in it.
Emily's List is the org that comes to mind there, and I think they endorsed her because she was the last remaining woman who had a chance of getting any delegates at all. It looks like they didn't want to force a choice between her and Amy Klobuchar.
> Harry fucking Reid.  A Reid endorsement a week before Nevada would not have had a Clyburn-sized effect, but it could have propelled her from fourth place into second place at least. Why mentor her in the Senate and champion her career and then sit by and watch her get fourth in your state?  There are so few politicians to show real political courage this election cycle (though many activists and labor unions showed great courage). I'm thinking about Julian Castro endorsing Warren after dropping, snubbing his old Obama administration colleague Biden. I'm thinking about the House members who endorsed Sanders after his heart attack when the media was crowing about his demise. I'm thinking about any official that endorsed either of them, really.  If Warren indicates she's not going to run again, I hope we can come together and work to elevate one of the congresspeople or cabinet officials that put it on the line this year. If she does, I think she would run away with it. Without the threat of a Trump reelection fueling risk-adversity or after four years of Biden filling the Oval Office with the stench of mediocrity, times up on the cynicism that prevented her, and probably ultimately Sanders, from leading the race this time.
The Harry Reid endorsement is the real tell here. Biden will win the nomination because democratic leadership regardless of how they feel about his policies have chosen him to oust Trump  I do wonder how his protege, Adam Jentleson who is one of Warren's staunches supporters, thought of that endorsement
You could definitely read between the lines throughout the season to see they really like Warren and were trying to stay somewhat neutral. You could also hear it in the crowd reactions on their live shows that their audience did too
They did a really fantastic job of staying neutral and pissing off everyone.  Do I wish they would have endorsed Warren? hell fucking yes. But that doesn't mean I don't still love PSA and Crooked Media. Crooked's newsletters (What a Day and Big Tent) are the highlights of my email inbox.
This forced neutrality will earn us a Blomberg on the ticket one day.   When there is not Warren to be the knife that cuts him at the knees, these good intended people who propose to care deeply about Democracy will pundit us into our own Trump.
Bruh what

That‚Äôs a strawman reduction of what I said and ultimately inconsistent with it.  If anything I called the voters intelligent and the political discourse stupid.   What I said, was that the dominant paradigm of political campaigning is based on candy - little snippets you can take away.  Warren offered candy of course, but the heart of her candidacy was real solutions based in more respect for the intelligence of the voters and accompanying complexity than is common in the modern era.  I also said that the electorate is becoming more and more intelligent as we progress as a society, insinuating that we are the most intelligent yet and in the future the path that Warren has reopened will reap benefits and rather than a failed candidacy I hope that we will view her as a trailblazer back to intelligent, thoughtful political discourse.
I can‚Äôt even talk to Bernie people about this, my husband and best friend included. Bernie is about to get stomped, which is so so so not what I want, but as a woman and a person who has followed politics religiously for my entire conscious life I am confident that we blew our chance for a progressive president. Oh well! *typo
They were so sure Warren supporters would be 100% for Bernie after she dropped, but it was really more like 50%. It was higher at the start of the primary, but they burned some bridges with awful online presence, and let‚Äôs be real, Bernie‚Äôs cardiac health is a legitimate concern.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to rally around the front runner‚Äù /s
He said he‚Äôd give Biden the nomination if he received more delegates.  Edit for clarity: he said he would drop out if Biden has the most delegates at the time of the convention.
I wonder if Sanders stubborness can work to our advantage.    Here's the scenario:  Sanders refuses to release his delegates unless Biden meets some conditions (1) He picks Warren as his VP and (2) He agrees to modify his platform (not as far left as Sanders b/c he wouldn't go for it, but some good progressive concessions).  If that works, then we might actual get out of the convention with Sanders supporters feeling like they won some substantial concessions and more willing to vote for Biden in the general election.  And bonus:  Warren as VP!  And she would run for president in 2024, because Biden is not going to run again, I'm certain.
Removed for rule 4. Please read the sub rules before you continue posting.
Some number of delegates have already gone to Pete, Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar. It's possible - though very unlikely - that Sanders and Biden split the remaining delegates in a way such that neither of them gets a majority. But given the statements that have been made about how whoever has the most delegates should end up the nominee, I can't see this resulting in a contested convention.
I think it could still happen. If Biden and sanders still split 50/50, the already allocated delegates from super Tuesday, Nevada, SC, NH, and IA would be enough to prevent either from getting the majority. Fivethirtyeight actually still has contested convention as the most likely outcome.
Any idea why Tulsi is staying in the race? I'm genuinely curious. Is she Bernie's backup in case of health issues?
It's always possible someone's health fails, not so much that they die, but that they have to drop out, she said hopefully?
The "no majority" is around 10%, but that is not equivalent to a contested convention. https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-what-are-the-chances-of-a-brokered-convention/amp/  Super delegates will overwhelmingly vote Biden, delegates from buttigieg, Klobuchar and bloomberg will vote biden (whether it's in the 1st or 2and round does not matter much).  Before Pete & Amy dropping out, and before we saw Elizabeth under viability in so many states, my hope was already a contested convention. But there is no chance of this now (barring big health problems or major scandal for either sanders or biden in the next few weeks).
Thank you for your response. I hadn‚Äôt considered your first point. The second one I‚Äôve heard a million times. Idk why people would ask her that. She obviously thinks she can win, she‚Äôs running...
All three of them entered and stayed in the race because they believed they'd be the best president. As is their right.  But that being said, since we're doing fanfic...I dream of what could have been, if Sanders didn't run and instead organized for Warren. I couldn't do it in 2016, *let's* do it in 2020. Imagine that! Ahh....
If they did they wouldn‚Äôt have entered this time to begin with.
You're so right. It will be here in a flash (especially if the next 4 years aren't a nightmare republican hellscape again). Persist!
It wasn‚Äôt good enough from them. They knew from Day 1 that Amy had no path and that Liz had a better women‚Äôs rights record and platform and they still sat on their hands. I suspect Bloomberg funding them might‚Äôve stalled things too.
Making choices during an election. Imagine that! This is that quote about fools being sure and wise being full of doubt in action.   It‚Äôs this kind of cowardice that ends up nominating the most boring and weak candidates to the general every time. Just make a damn decision! Hedging on this crap and pretending to be some opinionless Vulcan just makes sure the corrupt and the incompetent rise to the top every time.
That was such a foolish stance to take because for one, not all women are created equal. The fact that they the two being female was the reason for their holdup when those two were light years apart in policies makes me question their leadership
Even worse, Harry Reid loathes Biden‚Äôs politics and called Liz into his office in 2017 *specifically to ask her to run*.  That endorsement was a betrayal.
The Reid staffers who are firm Warrenites went deadly silent on the subject and have never mentioned it. Bernie also had several ex-Reid staffers who vocally expressed their displeasure though.
PSA came down pretty hard on Bloomberg, as I recall. It was up to Warren to actually kneecap him in front of a much bigger audience though.
No. It means that sexism and racism is built into the society at large.
Honestly, it's so uncomfortable. Some people who are very close to me have said some truly shitty things to me because I just don't see Sanders winning (2016 and now). I've stopped talking politics with all of them, because god damn they get so mean about Sanders.
True. The MAGA Evangelicals are chomping at the bit to make this a *Holy War* election to keep Murica a Christian Nation just because Bernie is Jewish.
I can‚Äôt either. They get so mad at any hypothetical scenario where Bernie doesn‚Äôt win and act like you don‚Äôt support basic human decency unless you vote for him.
yup.
Warren could have been the unity candidate between the moderates and the leftists. Unfortunately many factors conspired together to take her down and take that path away.

We need a goddamn wealth tax.
I‚Äôll never understand how $1 billion immediately got donated to fix an old church when it‚Äôs seemingly impossible to raise enough money to fix things that actually matter.

Money is not real it‚Äôs a social construct .  If you are worried about global warming people simply need to believe it‚Äôs necessary to fix and the money will miraculously appear in the same way the money for the twenty year war in the Middle East appeared .
The rich are like honeypot ants.  We feed them until they are fat, and when famine comes we rip them open and take it all back.
Warren‚Äôs wealth tax is lower than the rate that billionaires acquire new money. I completely agree with the wealth tax to fund things, but shouldn‚Äôt it be higher in order to reduce inequality and lower the ability of billionaires to buy our political system?
The green new deal doesn‚Äôt sound so hard
Peole get taxed for having too little money. It's banks that are imposing those taxes so it's cool. If it was government doing it that's just overreaching from corrupt liars /s
Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs estimated net worth of ~$4.7 million puts her far ahead of the average American, who is worth less than $100,000. I‚Äôm wondering when she plans on sharing her wealth.  Couldn‚Äôt she give away 4 million, and than comfortably live on 7 times what the average American is worth?  Just trying to understand redistribution of wealth for wealthy people who preach it from the mountain top every day.  What‚Äôs the rules here?  Does she realize she could cut a check to the treasury for 4 million bucks?  #hypocrite
Net worth != wealth.  You can't tax someone's net worth.
I actually think the rebuilding of the Notre Dame Cathedral has merit and adds value to humanity.  Massive multi-billion dollar media corporations funding garbage super hero movies every year adds nothing.
Too many loopholes.  Wealth tax does not and will not work.
hardly any of those donations actually came through, turns out the rich assholes were just saying it for clout.
Say that in r/news and watch your comment get downvoted into oblivion.
If you read Anand Giridharadas's book **"Winners Take All:** ***The Elite Charade of Changing the World".***  or listen to Anand discuss this on Micheal Moore's podcast, [https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/rumble-with-michael-moore/e/66238503?autoplay=true](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/rumble-with-michael-moore/e/66238503?autoplay=true)  It will all become **very clear** as to why the wealthy and powerful give money to singular causes, while they do not want to be told to pay taxes that go towards large societal/systemic causes or changes.     The wealthy will fight tooth and nail against any tax or change to the status quo.
That building has historical importance. I'll never understand how they spend hundreds of millions making stupid comic book movies with zero artistic importance in California when women and children are literally living on their streets.
Or the money to go to the moon. Once people decide to do something, the resources get figured out.   We could reverse climate change. We could provide fresh water to everyone in the world. We could end hunger. We could end wars. It's possible right now.
Yes, but we've gotta start somewhere.
Dude that's nothing, she's rich, not super rich. Hell Bezos has over 15,000 times more wealth.
> You can‚Äôt tax someone‚Äôs net worth  Why not? I could perhaps understand if you said we *shouldn‚Äôt* tax net worth but saying it‚Äôs physically impossible is ridiculous.
Yes but you can tax an increase in net worth before it happens by taxing the income used to finance it...
Elizabeth Warren: hold my beer
That‚Äôs comparing apples and oranges. Those movies aren‚Äôt funded to ‚Äúadd to the value of humanity‚Äù (although arguments for their artistic merit could certainly be made, it‚Äôs bedside the point here), they‚Äôre funded as *investments*. The media corporations aren‚Äôt just flinging money at them for no reason, they‚Äôre doing it because they earn an insane amount of money back. That‚Äôs part of why they spend so much money on them, they‚Äôre a pretty sure bet they‚Äôre going to earn the money it takes to make them back, and then some.
The wealthy give money to charitable causes, like rebuilding Nortre Dame, in order to convert their "liquid capital" (money), into "social capital" (notoriety, fame, influence, generally seeming like "a good person").  So that they can use it to gain more influence in society.     Wash and Repeat.  (Read Anand Giridharadas's book, Winner's Take All)     Multi-billionaire Media Corporations make super hero blockbusters not because they believe it will ultimately "add" anything to society, they make them because they know it is a popular formula for movies, and it will make them a lot of money.  Which they will use that money, to make more money.     Wash and Repeat.     Something that Anand points out in his book is that, the wealthy do these things, not just because they have a desire to give charity, or that they are passionate about producing a good.     They do it because these investments lead to returns.
Fine, I worship superheroes now.   > I actually think the ~~rebuilding of the Notre Dame Cathedral~~ the creation of amazing superhero movies has merit and adds value to humanity.  > ~~Massive multi-billion dollar media corporations~~random rich people funding garbage ~~super hero movies~~ Christian cathedrals based on fairy tales every year adds nothing.  Both of our statements are equally valid.
Too many ways to break out of jail. Let‚Äôs just shut all those bitches down bc they‚Äôll never work
yo maybe we should have a department in government that closes every new loop hole people come up. and maybe call it the department of finance.
Fuck doctors and medicine: there are too many germs around and all that medical science does not and will not work to defeat them all.
such as?
Yep, there are other ways to reduce the wealth gap and provide necessary funds without resorting to a wealth tax.
>Wealthy French don't seem to be eager to help fund the cleanup work, Celia Verot, director general of the Fondation du Patrimoine, told the Associated Press. Instead, donors have particular visions and are waiting to see how they align with the government's plans to repair the cathedral. "It's a voluntary donation, so the companies are waiting for the government's vision to see what precisely they want to fund," she explained.   >   >Another foundation official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the cleanup tasks currently underway aren't an appealing cause for wealthy donors. Rather, they'll more likely be vying to fund the construction of new architectural features for posterity.  [Source](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/notre-dame-fire-update-big-donors-delay-fulfilling-pledges-to-rebuild-notre-dame/)  The current cleanup effort is largely funded by Americans and a couple French billionaires who have donated a fraction of what they promised. Most of them want to donate to something they can stick a plaque on. Nothing says class like Louis Vuitton Spire ^(TM) at Notre Dame.
Congrats, you totally missed the point of the post.
>only my biases are valid
I‚Äôm not at all into marvel or disney in general but I think art and history and culture can simultaneously be important while also focusing on other issues.
>Colossal money thrown into projects of Cultural Significance is Warranted  >Colossal money being thrown into these other projects of Cultural Significance is terrible though
I don't understand what point your trying to make. One is about donating to a cause and the other is a business venture to make money. Apples and oranges.
> stupid comic book movies with zero artistic importance   To you. A stupid church with zero artistic importance isn't historically significant to everyone just because it is to you.
Nearly every country that had a wealth tax has repealed it. Including Germany and Sweden. http://www.oecd.org/ctp/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd-9789264290303-en.htm  They don't raise any worthwhile amount of money, are hard to administer, and complicate the tax code for everyone (more than it already is).  Additionally it just feels really wrong to go up to someone and say, "We don't like you and we think you have too much money, now give it to us until we think you have an appropriate amount of money":  https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/historys-biggest-robbery-nazis-stole-europes-gold/  > The Nazis also demanded that Vienna‚Äôs large and wealthy Jewish community hand over to Berlin 14.3 tons of their private gold. Schacht immediately departed for Vienna to lead the Nazi takeover of the Austrian central bank. In a festive celebration at its headquarters, he led the staff in a pledge of allegiance to Hitler, asking them to join him in ‚Äúa triple Sieg Heil to our F√ºhrer.‚Äù  Given that half of the top 10 billionaires in the US are jewish, it's just not a good look.  Edit: We also already have an estate tax.
Furthermore, much of the net worth of billionaires consists of financial assets, primarily stock holdings, which could also be taxed.
But capital gains tax is SoCiAlISm!
Explain that to Jeff Bezos, or Bill Gates. They didn't buy that stock and they weren't millionaires before they had it.
That‚Äôs not what she‚Äôs proposing.
They also do the same with AIDS charities, Environmental Groups  and LGTBQ Groups etc.

People don't really just "come up" with new loopholes. They're intentionally written into law and passed by Congress. A federal department wouldn't have the power to just close them.  But, the issue with the wealth tax isn't loopholes, it's in administration. How is the government going to do something like come up with a value for Koch Industries?
For instance?  Go ahead, we are all waiting.
so it looks like even the repair of this cathedral is going to fall victim to lobbying and the whims of the ultra-wealthy. don't we just love capitalism?
We really are heading towards Idiocracy are we?
*You're. It's a contraction of "you" and "are".
Lmfao we're seriously going with the "a lot of the wealthy are Jewish so progressive taxation is analogous to Auswitz" argument?
Our estate tax could use some strengthening.
>Additionally it just feels really wrong to go up to someone and say, "We don't like you and we think you have too much money, now give it to us until we think you have an appropriate amount of money"  OK but isn't it more like "for the continued health and financial stability of society we don't want to permit an extreme concentration of wealth in only a few hands to occur so we have enacted a tax on extremely high net worth individuals via a democratic process, here is your tax bill"?
Income inequality is much higher in the US than in Europe and taxing is far less progressive here. Did you realize that you linked a report which outlines what an effective wealth tax would look like? Or that its proposed wealth tax is very similar to Warren's?  From the report:  >The report also argues that capital income taxes alone will most likely not be enough to address wealth inequality and suggests the need to complement capital income taxes with a form of wealth taxation. The report finds that there is a strong case for an accompanying inheritance tax on efficiency, equity and administrative grounds.    Additionally...  >tax exemption thresholds should be high to ensure that the net wealth tax is only levied on the very wealthy       Warren's wealth tax has much higher thresholds than any other wealth tax I know of. Under Warren's plan, the tax is only levied against net worth > $50 million, whereas many European Wealth taxes kick in at under $1 million (and several well bellow, such as Switzerland at $100,000).  Again, from the report  >A similar argument can be made for countries that do not levy taxes on inheritances. Beyond tax considerations, there might also be greater justification for a net wealth tax in a country exhibiting high levels of wealth inequality as a way to narrow wealth gaps at a faster pace.   Sounds a lot like the US, with its high income inequality and an inheritance tax only levied in 6 states, and a lot like Warren's plan.  >Tax rates should be low and take into account tax rates on capital income to avoid imposing excessively high tax burdens on capital so as to prevent capital flight.  Warren's wealth tax rates are as low as 2% and as high as 6%. Capital flight is the main reason why some European wealth taxes are considered failures, but in addition to the previous point of European wealth taxes being levied against a significantly higher portion of the population (amplifying the problem of capital flight), the US levies taxes globally, so this is not as much an issue for the US as it is many European countries. Warren's wealth tax also includes a an exit tax of 40% over $50 million to anyone who would renounce their citizenship to avoid it.  The report also suggests for a wealth tax to allow...  >payments in instalments for taxpayers facing liquidity constraints  Warren's plan allows for 5 year deferment with interest.  The report says that a fairly levied wealth policy in tandem with progressive rates and proper enforcement can be an effective way to reduce income disparity quickly. Warren has also made it a staple of her campaign that the tax will only be relevant to about 75,000 households, so I'm not sure how that complicates the tax code for everyone. The problem that a wealth tax hopes to solve is that so long as capital gains greatly exceed economic growth, the rich will accumulate wealth at a much faster rate than anyone else can hope to earn it. Again, this problem is much more pervasive in the US than in many other OECD countries, which often already have progressive income tax rates that prevent such vast accumulation of wealth.  It's baffling that you're comparing progressive socialist tax agenda to actual fascism. Besides the fact that a wealth tax policy has nothing to do with what religion a few rich people are, you must understand the difference between Nazi's literally invading other countries and stealing gold from Jewish people to pay for an army and a progressive tax on billionaires used to pay for social reforms and welfare. By your logic, we should probably lower taxes on the upper class since a [plurality of them are Jewish](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/), and we don't want to be seen as Nazis.
Capital is mobile and thus liable to tax competition, in particular for small states in a common market which prohibits capital controls such as the European Union. Wealth taxes (including a withholding tax on wealth moved to tax havens) at federal US or EU level can very much work.  In no way would administering a wealth tax be more complicated than the current byzantine system of international corporate income tax and transfer-pricing. This also depends entirely on the design of said wealth tax and the resources available to the tax authority.
Gets a lot harder if you're trying to tax privately held companies like Cargill or Koch.
It is taxed at the time of sale.  Edit: You can downvote me but it doesn't make it any less true. If you have a counter point I'd love to hear it.
Or it harms retirees who are living off investments and pensions.

Everything you need to value for a wealth tax already has valuation methods used when someone dies.  People make estimates of the value of things all the time and a business will have a lot more precise accounting of the components that go into valuing it than say someone's house, but states have been taxing that wealth forever.
Broadening the estate tax would be the place to start. There are lots of options whose histories are more effective than wealth taxes.
Well we still haven't learned to publically fund things for the public good, so yea.  The private sector will only solve the things that benefit it. So it will be the Louis Vitton tower unless the French agree to pay the tax to fix it.
I ain't gonna speak pretty on mobile. Thanks for clarifying basic kindergarten vocabulary though! I'm sure everyone was confused until you helped out.
[deleted]
At a much lower rate than income from actual work.
Then we should have a better system in place to make sure people are able to live when they retire.
That's ignoring the fact that her tax [only affects those with over 50 million in assets](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax). So unless the retires you're worried about are in the [75,000 richest families in the united states](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/facts-on-warrens-wealth-tax-plan/) there will be no increase in taxes for them. So, I'm confused about what you're worried about.
Then you introduce thresholds for these taxes so that they don't target small pensions and savings. Which is pretty customary for these sort of things.
Estate taxes are already rather difficult when dealing with very wealthy people who have assets with no established market value. But with the estate tax, the government and the estate only have to battle things out in court once since most people tend to only die the one time.  It's pretty damn hard to value something like the Trump brand name or the Star Wars franchise (before being sold to Disney), and we can probably find something more productive for the IRS to do than get embroiled in these fights on an annual basis.
Yeah.  We could do that too.
The top three richest Americans all gathered their wealth within their lives and two of them still have decades of life left.  Estate taxes are effective in limiting inequality stemming from generational wealth, but do nothing to reduce or access the wealth of many of the ultrarich.
Or the corporations could pay reasonable/fair taxes and then the state could be able to pay for the tower with money to spare and not have to rely on corporations that are bleeding the state dry.  We're in agreement here, I was just posting your words from a slightly different angle.
**Swedish financial transaction tax**  The Swedish financial transaction tax was a 0.5% financial transaction tax (FTT) applied to equity securities, fixed income securities and financial derivatives between 1984 and 1991.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
That doesn‚Äôt change the circumstances for those people who are a sizable percentage of the voter base.
It's pretty damn hard to value a house.  They're estimates, of which a small percentage is turned into a tax, and with the scope of the wealth being taxed you could hire someone for each billionaire and make it their full-time job to evaluate their wealth and it wouldn't even make a dent in the revenue.  Businesses have revenue and assets and people make estimates on their value all the time when they're bought and sold.  Even if they completely ignore trying to value their potential for future growth, they'll still get a perfectly fine estimate.
Two of the three started with money though.  Buffett‚Äôs dad was in congress.  Gates‚Äô mom knew the CEO of IBM.  Bezos was no t wealthy at birth.  Regardless estate taxes are repeatedly supported by economists as a way of combatting the wealth gap.  Don‚Äôt forget the boomers, who represent the majority of the wealthy, are beginning to die off.  Raising the estate tax is a good idea
The housing market is something big enough that there's a zillion data points to compare to in order to get a pretty close estimate. Billionaires, by comparison, have a lot of stuff that's incredibly uncommon or one of a kind.  And, they don't really make estimates all the time, because they're not bought and sold all the time. That's why I'm talking about things where there's not an established market value, because it's not something bought and sold. The number of times the Star Wars franchise was sold is exactly once. Number of times shares in the Trump Corporation have been sold? Possibly zero. Same with Koch, Cargill, and lots of other closely held corporations.  >you could hire someone for each billionaire and make it their full-time job to evaluate their wealth and it wouldn't even make a dent in the revenue  You're going to need large teams of attorneys and accountants and all sorts of other experts whenever a valuation gets challenged, not a single IRS tax attorney. When you tell someone you're going to hit them with a $70 million tax bill that year, they're going to be highly motivated to hire an army of attorneys to bring that bill down, and the IRS is going to have to staff up to fight them.  Sure, the government will still make money at the end of the day, but we'll also have taken something like 500-1000 of the smartest people around, taken them out of any productive work, and put them into litigating both sides of tax evaluation cases. There's a lot simpler ways to raise revenue, like increasing the capital gains tax or implementing a VAT.
Sure, but that's not why they're rich and does nothing about the disproportionate wealth that's getting stuck in the few lucky entrepreneurs.  I'm totally on board with radically raising the estate tax (generational wealth is bad), but it's not a substitute for a wealth tax and doesn't accomplish the same things.
No one is proposing the wealth tax because it's the simplest revenue stream.  It's a policy in and of itself.  That it also provides funding for other progressive policy is even better.  I was waiting for the clockwork redirect to the (regressive) VAT though, so now that we've reach that part of the Yang drive-by I think I'll bow out.

Apparently I was a little hard to miss. I did not get it from Raygun, although I do like their stuff (though most of it doesn‚Äôt come in size circus tent for me). I ordered it online from a website, I don‚Äôt remember the name.
1) She offers tough criticisms of the political system and specific, detailed remedies. (I.e., she has a plan for that.)  2) She has made her career as a champion for financial regulation in order to advocate for the middle class.  3) She was the architect of the CFPB, despite industry pushback, which shows that she can get things done in Washington.  4) She does not pull her punches. She fights hard. In practice this means that she has been historically unwilling to sell out to business interests. (And is notable for calling out other Democrats like Hillary and Biden when they did.)  5) She's really fucking smart, and a strong communicator.  6) Her dog is adorable.

By that math that makes her 110% our future president.

Ok then my bad.
Warren wasn't "stealing" Bernie voters. She was pulling moderates to the left.
I‚Äôm a moderate pulled left by Warren
I posted about another second choice poll from 2/28 (before Amy and Pete dropped out) that showed only 40% of Warren supporters supported Bernie second, saying that if she dropped out before Super Tuesday, it ***C***ould have helped Biden. I have a twitter with about 30 followers and I didn't used any hashtags. Some guy found my post and just said I was wrong. So I calmly linked to the exact poll I was referencing. He brushed it off because Amy and Pete had dropped out. I was like, yes, but Bernie didn't get their supporters when they dropped. And so he made an irrelevant comment about Biden's debate performances, suggesting that when people see him and Bernie in a debate together, they will choose Bernie - I guess he thinks people haven't already seen them debate each other? I decided to take the high road and stop debating that stranger on the internet - it wasn't worth my energy. Bernie is my second choice, but some Bernie supporters can be absolutely EXHAUSTING. And to the people who are tempted to respond to this post with a "not all Bernie supporters", please stop.
Wow, those comments.   Berners need to take note of this and see how Warren was able to garner support from the folks that would go to Biden. They liked *her* and her message. They liked the tone and tenor of the happy warrior (Biden, Buttigieg, and Klobuchar were also). If they continue to bury their heads in the sand and fail to realize Elizabeth Warren is a gateway progressive, Sanders cannot expand his base.
Also:  1) Many of the Warren-Bernie supporters already switched to Bernie  2) Incivility and not showing the ability to build a coalition among Democrats turned away many others that were originally planning on switching to Bernie
This 100% for me.  I admit that I am less liberal than Sen. Warren on economics and foreign policy. I admired her chutzpah and integrity, so I forgave that she wasn't lock-step with my own positions. I believed that she had the electability to appeal to both sides of the Democratic voting bloc and the procedural wonkiness to *actually* shift the Overton Window legislatively, which I do not think Sanders could do.  Also, I appreciated that she was anti-establishment in a *nuanced* way. I couldn't support Sanders, because I had no idea how he could staff a government. You can't get anything done without good staff. Obama wouldn't have been half as successful without people like Biden and Clinton in his administration.  Biden, Pete, and Amy would have hired heavily from the repeat players that served in the Obama and Clinton administrations. I have my disagreements with Obama's administration, although I thought it largely successful, particularly on legislative effectiveness and an ability to successfully push back on top military brass. So I'm not keen on a repeat of that with the same old, same old, but I do admit that having old faces in there is better than having *no faces*, which is what I think would happen in a Sanders presidency.  On the other hand, I think that Warren had a deep, deep well of support from very qualified POC, women, and/or academics that have been pushed out of our politics and marginalized. I could see her administration being fully staffed and competent, and not full of old faces. I admired that about her.  I'm very sad to see that the American public did not support her. I was very enthusiastic about Hilary Clinton in 2008 and 2016, but I found Warren to be even more inspiring, albeit with a bit less experience. I truly believe she was always the best for the job. She, in all ways, was superior to Sanders because she had a plan for getting things done, which is what I believe this country needs.  Now that she's gone, I'm supporting the only person left in the race that has a plan that makes sense to get things done. That's Biden. If Sanders wanted my vote, he should have adopted the coalition-building wonkiness of Warren, not shifted harder and harder to the left.
How fucking entitled do you have to be to claim someone was ‚Äústealing‚Äù YOUR votes
True, in my case. I was a Jay Inslee supporter, and donated and volunteered for Warren after she adopted his climate plan.  I've known of Bernie Sanders for three decades, since the *60 Minutes* feature on the Burlington mayor from the 80s that has been dredged up recently. I've followed progressive media (mostly *Democracy Now* and Ian Masters) for decades. Even before I became acquainted with Sanders' personality and that of his supporters, I knew him to be unelectable to national office. If the Right can weaponize John Kerry's patriotic service, they'd have a field day with Sanders' years on the political fringe. We can't afford to lose the suburbs, the House, more seats in the Senate, and 2 seats on the Supreme Court, and a Sanders nomination would be political suicide for the party. So Sanders was never an option for me, though of course I would have voted for him in the general, as I expect to do for Biden.  Warren is the progressive that could have been electable in the general while building the Democratic coalition down ballot. I believe its unfortunate that both Biden and Sanders chose to run this cycle. At some point, it's wise to step aside.
Wow, it's almost like what we were saying the whole time was correct and Bernie's Twitter stans were just being hysterical.   Seriously though, between this and Sanders' shortsighted demand that the plurality winner gets the nomination in every case, he's done so much to damage his campaign in the past two weeks.   And all the Twitter narrative can do is shift from "she's a bad faith agent sent to pull away progressive support" to "she was only ever pulling Hillary voters anyway." The ability to shift reality to fit their narrative rivals Trump supporters. (Yes, Bernie lurkers, less racist for sure, but still just as susceptible to the same fallacies and groupthink.)
So as we‚Äôve all been saying since October, had Bernie Sanders gracefully stepped aside after his heart attack, she would‚Äôve won in a landslide.
She had the best unifying messages I've ever seen. I will always love her.
Unfortunately though, many of the hardcore, nasty Bernie supporters (as opposed to the more prevalent and agreeable variety) will never admit that they were wrong.  I also suspect they will continue to deny this by saying they could have done better if she had dropped sooner.  With how everything shakes out, as cruel as it sounds, part of me hopes that Sanders regrets joining the 2020 campaign for the rest of his life, because it severely hobbled the chances of Warren and thus any progressive from winning the white house.
I went from strong Bernie-supporter in 2016 primary, to horrified democrat when it turned out that many of his supporters didn't come together to vote for Hillary in the general, to being embarrassed of having voted for him after my interactions with the bros online, to THRILLED Warren was running to now.     I wouldn't vote for Bernie if you paid me. I can't stand Biden either but I would rather he win the primary at this point. My second choice after Warren is nobody. I'll vote for her even though she's out of the race, and I'll vote for any democrat in the general, even Bernie if that's who it is.
More proof that Warren was by far the better choice for progressives.
Oof. This wounds my heart.  I've been saying for months she wasn't going to win the nomination - but neither were Bernie or Biden - and Warren would end up being the unity candidate at a contested convention.  Now whichever old white dude we pick (it's \~100% Biden, IMO)  - we're going to dissociate the other end of the party and Trump is going to get re-elected when either Bernie supporters don't show up for Biden (or actively vote against him like 10% did to Hillary) - or the most centrist of Biden voters stay home because while they can't vote for Trump, they can't vote for Socialist either.  I don't see a way to fix this division. This is Trump vs Biden now, and Bernie voters are going to ragequit rather than rally to Biden.
I'll take "Things you won't see in r/politics for $200, Alex."
Warren was able to open the eyes of moderates who were too afraid of Bernie and the way he spread his message. Warren was able to deliver a very similar message in a way that was much more palatable to these people. Now that she has dropped out those people who were willing to open up a little bit to progressive ideas are scared back to the familiarity of candidates like Biden and moderate ideas.
Honestly, I‚Äôm a moderate by all definitions, but first Pete, then Warren pull/pulled me to the left, but now I‚Äôm all in on Biden because I kind of hate Bernie
Ridiculous, when I show this poll to Sanders supporters all they have to say is "She should've dropped out before Super Tuesday AND endorsed Bernie, and her not endorsing right now is disappointing."  How fucking entitled are these people?
I'm a libertarian that until this election was a registered Republican.   She pushed hard for corruption, she's very intelligent, and she listened to how people reacted to her plans and took that into account on version 2 of those plans. I voted for her in the Primary not because we are ideologically similar but, because as an American first, I felt it was important for us to have a candidate that took into account the civil liberties common between left and right voters in younger generations while tackling the corruption that pushed so many Americans to Trump in the first place. On top of that I felt like Biden would remind too many Americans of the establishment status quo we were trying to break the cycle of while Bernie was too ideological for many Americans. Plus, like it or not Trump is going to have a hay day with the word "socialism" if Bernie wins because Americans have been very conditioned to a specific and fearful narrative surrounding it.   I am indeed sad she dropped out and I still don't know if I'm going to go back to my libertarian corner of the world and work hard for an upset or if I'll suck it up and vote for Biden or Bernie.
Again proving that Bernie has a ceiling and he's already hit it. He wasn't bringing in any new voters that he already didn't have and I'm the general election isn't going to beat Trump.
I agree with most of Warren's policies and now I'm heavily favoring Biden.  Which, frankly, has surprised me.  But essentially it comes down to getting something versus nothing.  I've had some serious reservations about Bernie for awhile (which is why I supported Warren instead), but this week convinced me that he will lose Independents in the general and not be able to turn out enough youth voters to make up for it.  I also think that Trump will weaponize his Socialism and beat him over the head with it and it will scare away any moderate voters.  It convinced me that Bernie will lose to Trump if he's nominated.  I'm not sure if Biden will win vs. Trump, but I think he's got a better shot.  And Biden's supporters have been much more welcoming.  I can see him taking some of Warren's ideas if he wins.  If Trump wins you get nothing (or worse).  So that's how you get from Warren to Biden.  It's not rocket science.  But from the comments it seems like it blows some Bernie supporter's minds.
She also pulled at least one cult member out of the Bernie insanity. Watching Hillary on Hulu rn and crying.
I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter and anecdotally this seems to be true. A lot of my moderate friends were Warren supporters wooed to the left by her. I also had friends who supported Bernie in ‚Äò16 who chose to support Warren this time. It was probably close to a 50-50 split.
Which is why she was the best candidate!
Guilty as charged. Never thought of myself as a progressive until I started following Warren closely
Oh look, oratory skill matters.
Many real hardcore progressives went to Bidens camp because their theory of change is through institutions and coalitions, and not #branding.
Everything would've been different if Sanders had dropped out after the heartattack.  His unwillingness to reach out across the isle has finally caught up to him, the ceiling is just too low.
I'm interested to see how this actually shakes out. Obviously, voters don't always go with their second choice otherwise we would have seen a Warren surge on Super Tuesday (she was a top 2nd choice for Klobuchar and Buttigieg voters).
She really made some forceful arguments that definitely affected how i saw things. Im still not sold on single payer, and as someone in hc i likely never will be. But her positions on corruption and campaign finance. Yeah ill take some of that please
I'm a moderate, but if Warren really did use a strap on to fuck a marine, it'd be my patriotic duty to vote for her.
I had a hunch this was unintuitively the case. It is nice to have some evidence though.
100% this
Of course she was because she was talking about common sense policy and sensible regulation with plans to back it up versus Bernies plans which seemed like empty words with no understanding of actual cost.
I'm a pro gun social democrat that just wants competence and intersectionality in policy.      Sanders covers the first two but not the last two. Biden none.
I am confused about what is what, this other tweet has different percentages.  Are these different regions?  &#x200B;   [https://twitter.com/Politics\_Polls/status/1235600252549451776](https://twitter.com/Politics_Polls/status/1235600252549451776)
I donated to both Bernie and Warren because they strengthened each other‚Äôs arguments.
It‚Äôs worth noting that the credibility interval is +/- 5.1% for Dems, and higher for sub questions.  (Only 67 Warren supporters were polled in this sample, so it may be much higher.)  I sure hope the party lets Warren write the party platform.   Still is a compelling stat.
Agreed. Also, even if you do want to hold onto the argument that a vote for Warren means a vote taken from Bernie, the amount of votes she got on ST was tiny. They would not have made much of an impact except maybe in her home state.
Yup. All this recent info just proves all of us right all along.
Can you highlight this evidence please?  I‚Äôve reviewed the report but I‚Äôm not able to find it.
Exactly. Thank you my brothers and sisters here for all your hard work and dedication. I was team Bernie from day one but Warren did some amazing work and led a groundbreaking campaign.
I donated to both Bernie and Warren because they strengthened each other‚Äôs arguments.
Sample size is extremly small for such a question.   I trust morning consultant more.

Interesting I saw her more as a moderate compared to Bernie. Kinda why I thought she would have done better in the race.
Seconded here.
Which is why she was a way better candidate. I was also a moderate who would have voted progressive for Warren. Screaming about establishment Democrats being the bad guy is not going to unify the party to beat trump. He‚Äôs alienated suburban women, senior voters, and African Americans. I don‚Äôt see him growing the party. He‚Äôs too divisive. For every one young person he gets to donate he loses several more reliable voters with the rhetoric and misogyny.
Me too
Me too
Same. I mean honestly idk what any of the labels mean anymore. I was in between where Hillary and Bernie started in 2016, but was happy with her platform by the convention. If Bernie is the definition of liberal now then I‚Äôm no longer considered a liberal. Can we just be Democrats? üòÇ
Same, what always worried me about the progressive movement was how would everything be accomplished. But warren gave amazing, detailed plans for how things would be accomplished. She‚Äôs brilliant and also pragmatic, which would have made for a great president.
What attracted you to Warren on policy then?
That is the word:  EXHAUSTING.  They are the internet equivalent of a guy who will follow you down the street, and into your home rambling all the way and refuse to leave until you agree with him.  They will not stop.  It's fanatical in nature.  Zealots make me nervous.
i‚Äôm a sanders supporter and i couldn‚Äôt agree more with you. i‚Äôm sorry some of us don‚Äôt get it.
Yeah those comments are crazy.  "But but... the policies!"  You won't get any policies if you lose to Trump.  I was going to vote my heart for Warren.  But now I'm heavily leaning towards voting with my head instead.  I don't think Bernie can win against Trump.  And I'd rather take some movement of policy (perhaps even influenced by Warren) vs. no movement or backsliding with Trump.
I think the problem will always come back to, no matter how dumb it sounds, the fact that Bernie is not a Democrat and pretty clearly has some grievances against the party. I know a deal of Democrats who wanted Warren that won‚Äôt go to Bernie because they feel like he‚Äôs not really part of the same party.   Ultimately, I think that‚Äôs what Bernie needs to acknowledge in order to still win. He needs to make friends with the people leading the party, because a lot of us do pay attention to our party leaders endorsements.
This makes a lot of sense. Many of Warren's "Bernie 2nd choice" left back in the fall when Warren's numbers dropped and Bernie went up. That means what you have left from Warren supporters are going to include a lot less Bernie 2nd Choice than before.  Add in that the Bernie supporters have been far harder on Warren than the moderate supporters, it makes sense that many who are still on team Warren (before she dropped out) and previously had Bernie as 2nd choice would be hesitant to go to Bernie.
3. Some of us are progressives who have been critical of this behavior for years. Many of you who are showing up now to try and get people to support Bernie, have denied / downplayed how often this happens.      Step 1 to getting Warren supporters will be admitting there has been a problem and making actual strides to fix it. For years, I've seen too much denial, deflection, and festering. If Bernie loses, ChapoTrapHouse will tell people to vote third party. So are you going to stake it out with them, or us?
My friends and I fall under #2. #WarrenToBiden! New York is waiting for you! The negativity and aggression in the Bernie camp is just too much!
I‚Äôm in the second group. I haven‚Äôt voted yet, and I was planning on voting for Warren even if she wasn‚Äôt going to win, but now that she dropped out I‚Äôm torn. I don‚Äôt like Bernie. I worry about his health and I don‚Äôt think he will be an effective President. Even if I like his policies, he still needs to be able get them passed. I think Joe is too moderate for my taste, but I do have a lot of respect for him.
I am hoping Sanders drops so I can vote my conscience late this month.
Yes, it was the incivility that mirrored Trump cultism, along with FSB being behind both Trump and Sanders, ultimately caused me to switch my vote from Bernie to Warren.

Someone said I look like a carrot on twitter and honestly that night I went home and registered as a Republican after 35 years as a true and blue Democratic.  This disrespect has to stop, and if words won‚Äôt stop them than maybe action will.
Another consideration:  We love Liz because she has plans. We're pragmatists. So we're more likely to back the candidate we think is more likely to beat Trump.

Status Quo 2020
I agreed with everything until I got to the last paragraph. Even if Biden has a plan, the goal of his plan leads to no significant improvements.
This is very well said.  And I loved Jay Inslee.  I cannot think of any voter who would not have liked him, progressives or moderates.  He would have been a fabulous unity candidate as would Warren.
My favorite is that on a given day Bernie supporters are shouting that Warren is a sell out and not really a progressive but a centrist establishment corporate shill who abandoned all principles and a snake to boot, and the next day after she drops out, they do a 180 and start saying that their ideas are basically the same with only minor differences so Warren supporters should vote for Bernie.  Which is it?  LOL.
The plurality winner should absolutely always win. Also I don‚Äôt think you should let a group of Twitter users decide your generalized opinion on a large group of voters.
So many of the exit polls were, "I love Warren, but we've got to stop Bernie (or Biden)!" So then voted one or the other.     Just imagine- if everyone actually voted for WHO THEY WANTED AS PRESIDENT, we'd have a candidate at least mostly well-liked by both progressives and moderates.
I would have loved it if the septuagenarian white dudes who have already lost a primary would have sat this one out.  Or if we're gonna vote for a former loser septuagenarian white man at least bring back John Kerry.
100%
Bingo.  It's not the message; it's the messenger.  He is actually preventing progressive ideas from going mainstream in his zeal to demonize the mainstream.
Yep, but his ego was more important.
I feel like we‚Äôre all forgetting that her opposition hammered her on the M4A plan and pushed a narrative that it isn‚Äôt feasible. Before that, she was steadily approaching Biden in the polls
If she didn‚Äôt have to cater to Sanders, her platform of anti-corruption and fairness in our financial system, even the tax billionaires instead of the middle class and holding social media tycoons to account could have appealed to Trump voters as well as moderates and progressives. Sanders is like an anchor holding us back from finding common ground as ordinary workers.
His own staff and surrogates (including congresspeople and his press secretary) haven‚Äôt figured out the math yet seeing as they all blamed his ST showing on Liz not dropping out.  Just as they‚Äôll blame Liz for his upcoming March 10 losses if she doesn‚Äôt endorse even though this race is already over, and they‚Äôll blame her at the convention, and they‚Äôll blame her if Trump wins re-election, and...
> I also suspect they will continue to deny this by saying they could have done better if she had dropped sooner.  I told people before Super Tuesday that what is left of Warrens supporter were probably split between Biden and Bernie as a 2nd choice meaning she now has little impact on Bernie's performance.
Given how set in his ways and incapable he is of change, I just don't see Sanders ever having regrets about anything.  And he has a circle of people who are basically as sycophantic to him as Trump supporters are to Trump.
are you me
lol this is exactly me.

On what evidence do you base the claim that 'many of his supporters didn't come together to vote for Hillary in the general'? In three surveys of Trump-Sanders crossover the rates were estimated at 6, 12 and 12%. This seems to be in line with general trends of crossover; for example, two surveys of Hillary-McCain crossover in 2008 were estimated at 24 and 25% respectively.  More indepth analysis and sources can be found in [this Washington Post article from 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/08/24/did-enough-bernie-sanders-supporters-vote-for-trump-to-cost-clinton-the-election/).  This is of course not to excuse Sanders-Trump crossover; just to contextualize it as something that is, unfortunately, clearly not out of the norm.  Full disclosure, I have voted for Sanders and acknowledge my biases; however, I like to think I'm rational and can be swayed by facts and evidence. I like Warren a lot, and as a staunch progressive would have voted for her if I believed she had a better shot at winning the nomination than Sanders.
Imagine if neither Bernie or Biden ran this cycle?  We would be choosing from a crop of much better candidates.  None of which are polarizing.  Other than Bloomberg, but he was a nonentity once Warren got her claws into him.
I find this very dismissive. I support progressive policies. I think Warren can actually make progress on those policies and Bernie can't. With him as president I doubt we'd make much progress if any at all.   More importantly I don't think there's any way Bernie will beat Trump. Getting Trump out of office is of the utmost importance. I am a pragmatic voter. Hence a pragmatic candidate appealed to me.
[deleted]
They've found their scapegoat and they are going to beat it to death.
About as entitled as the Trumpers.
And Biden will?
Yassssss betch
That poll was before Bloomberg dropped out if I'm correct.
No it would not.  Stop trying to make S*nders/Warren happen. It‚Äôs shit.
If she endorses Sanders and he doesn't win the majority, then the supers will choose someone else and the party will be destroyed for the election.  Biden needs to be the clear nominee at this point, as non-ideal as that is.
Warren is the most liked candidate in the field and is now at 23%, just 2 points behind Biden
I like her.
It is my belief that Biden is actually one of the riskier options. I think he is currently the most popular he will ever be, and will essentially only go down from here once the attack ads start.  He is uninspiring, which is going to be critical for bringing the numbers to the polls necessary to beat Trump.  I think many other candidates (Warren for example) will increase in popularity as we get closer and people start to learn about her and her platform.
How is Biden ahead of *anyone*? He‚Äôs so out of touch!
She would absolutely destroy Trump in a debate.  She thinks quickly on her feet & would not be fazed by his moronic insults.  IMO she would kill him with witty comebacks and one liners.  That lady is sharp as a tack.
The [averages across multiple polls](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) are much more grim. They put Biden at 16.5 percentage points ahead of the nearest competition.
I'm glad she's well liked, but liking someone did not mean they're gonna vote for them.   I like a bunch of candidates I can only vote for one.
Do polls really matter this early?  I see 3-4 candidates that have real potential.  My support is fully behind Warren at this stage but I‚Äôm not going to be a Warren or Bust voter come next November.  The debates this week won‚Äôt have any affect on my support because none of the candidates have enough time to make an impression.  Everyone is looking for that sound bite like Harris made agains Biden last time.
I love Liz.
Resistbot as of an hour ago, has Warren at nearly half, out of 25k votes:  * Warren 47% * Sanders 13% * Harris 12% * Buttigieg 8% * Yang 8% * Biden 6% * O'Rourke 3% * Williamson 1% * Booker 1% * Castro 1%  Not sure about anything else out of this. I was using the bot to thank my rep for finally backing impeachment, and the bot asked if I wanted to take their poll.
I like the discussion happening in this thread, that said, I wish we had a real anti-poll movement in this country. This obsession with polling is largely a distraction and is part of what is ruining substantive political discourse in this country.
I've been telling clowns on reddit that she's extremely likable for awhile now. Glad to be vindicated. :)
Biden is the most conservative, and likely to go softer on big businesses, amongst the group including Warren and Sanders.  It shouldnt be a surprise why the major media outlets are CONSTANTLY pushing Biden as the frontrunner.  if a dem's gonna take office, they want it to be biden.  Let's not make that a possibility.  Go Liz!
This is just **one** poll with a sample size of 1,912.  The result may be surprising but it's hardly a settled fact. Stay vigilant.
Not sure how accurate this poll is. It you follow the link, it says it oversamples women of color. But it‚Äôs nice to know she‚Äôs doing so well with that demographic.
She might just do it. We'll see.
Warren or Bernie. There are no other candidates for President.
Serious question, how is she gonna keep Trump from just saying Pocahontas over and over again. I feel like this is going to be hard to overcome
Does it bother anyone else that those pictures she poses for with supporters are called "selfies"? Not to take away from her efforts to connect with people at all, but the misuse of that term just makes me cringe.
I hope she wins. She‚Äôll tax the wealthy and work on saving the climate. Cancelling student debt will be a huge boost. I hope she also does healthcare for all.
I like her bunches
his history of poor judgement, gaffes, and relative conservatism don't help.
I honestly don't worry about Biden and think it worth paying him any mind. If anything, he's useful to Warren.  His place as the frontrunner in the SocLib primary is pretty tenuous and will continue to have Harris/Buttigieg/O'Rourke/et.al. biting at his heels in the hopes of getting the Obamastalgia vote.  And the longer he's in, the better it is for Warren. She can beat Biden if it comes down to the two of them and if she's the predominant not-Biden, then she'll benefit as the field narrows.  As to the risk of Biden losing, he is about average risk. An unenthused left is a problem but he'll do better than Hillary did with the center, what with not having the sexism problem.  But I think Warren and Harris, in that order, are the lowest risk and most likely to yield the greatest numbers.
I think Biden is the only one of the serious contenders who has a serious risk of not winning. The man is a walking gaffe
He lost me with his "Nothing will fundamentally change" comment to his billionaire financiers. That, on top of his constant string of bad choices, and his utter inability to show even the slightest bit of remorse, has bad idea written all over it.
Biden is Clinton 2.0. He‚Äôs the corporate choice and is wrong for America.
He is John Kerry part 2.
Brand recognition. Don't underestimate literally decades of public service and being VP of the first black president. He is known across the world, Warren is, in comparison, a fairly unknown senator who hasn't been in office that long, relatively speaking.   Put it this way, my local burger joint is far better than McDonalds, but everyone knows those golden arches. Warren is fighting an uphill battle for votes. She is doing amazingly, and it helps that she is sincere and when people actually hear her they find they agree with pretty much everything she says. I'm not too worried, there's plenty of time and she has the momentum that only increases after public appearances. Bring on the debate.
1. Insane name recognition 2. He‚Äôs white 3. He‚Äôs a man 4. He‚Äôs straight 5. He doesn‚Äôt scare the rich and powerful
I have been out canvassing for Warren in NH and again and again what I hear is that people want someone who can beat Trump. Fair or unfair, the polling and the perception is that the person most likely to be able to do that is Biden. It becomes a self fulfilling prophecy unfortunately where the polls and the media say Biden‚Äôs electable and people believe he‚Äôs electable so they say they support him because he‚Äôs electable.   Warren‚Äôs path to victory runs through the early states. Given all her positives, if she shows in Iowa or NH she can win she will suddenly become electable for Democratic primary voters. Once she has the primary won, her arguments, policies, and likability can beat Trump.
I really like Biden. He seems like a pretty good guy who always tries to do what he thinks is right while trying to be kind to everyone. He legitimately acts like my grandfather.    My grandfather would make an awful president. If your biggest hobbies and passion include butterscotch ice cream and making applesauce, you should leave the nuclear codes to someone else. I need someone who can govern a nation, to lead it. I need my grandfather to help me figure out how good canning methods.    Biden is a fairly likeable guy. Probably not president material though.
FWIW, the party is evenly split between people who identify as liberal and who identify as moderate or conservative. Biden basically has the moderate/conservative side to himself.  Also, in a recent poll where Democrats were asked if they‚Äôd prefer a candidate with a ‚Äúbold new agenda‚Äù or ‚Äúwho will provide steady, reliable leadership,‚Äù 72% chose steady, reliable leadership.   Biden‚Äôs support comes from older and nonwhite voters. He‚Äôs pretty in touch with them IMO. His vision maybe shouldn‚Äôt be the party‚Äôs vision, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs out of touch at all. Just out of touch with younger and more liberal voters.    https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-6-16  While Fox News is he generally awful, their polls are fine and are rated highly by 538.
I wouldn‚Äôt say that, he seems to be touching things all the time
I seriously wonder if people making comments like this are of voting age or just reached voting age, because they make absolutely zero sense given any sort of thought.  Fact, America elected Trump. Not everyone acts exactly like you and people on Reddit. In fact, we‚Äôre a minority and it often shows.  Most people have stable jobs/income. They don‚Äôt want massive changes that create threats to their jobs or life style. If they can vote for the guy that will make their life marginally better but also not changing much, they will. People like having the comfort of sameness.  Also let‚Äôs be honest, America hates women. Hillary would‚Äôve won if she was a man. She also wouldn‚Äôt have had high standards had she been a man. Warren/Harris is facing this too.
Actually if you read the article she's in second place for first choice at 23%, just behind Joe Biden who's at 25%, sorry if the heading was not clear
I disagree pretty strongly actually. Obama had once in a generatiom levels of charisma, but was given flake for being inexperienced and a little lacking on policy. Hillary was a massive policy wonk, but historically disliked. Warren being well liked is extremely important and when it comes down to it, low information voters in Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are going to vote with their gut, not with policy briefs.    If it was just based on resume, Hillary would be enjoying an easy run for her 2nd term right now.
Good point, but this still seems like a positive data point.
> I'm glad she's well liked, but liking someone did not mean they're gonna vote for them.  While true, if you look at the flip side, not liking someone can lead you to not vote for them. Being liked means that people will listen to you when you have a platform. Liking someone can make you look at their views on different policies. Liking you can lead to someone donating. Likability plays a big factor in politics whether we think it makes you a viable candidate or not. Republicans have always run on "who would you want to have a beer with." Someone could have all the qualifications, have the policies, have the funding, etc but if they're a pretentious dickhead, some people won't vote for them just because they don't like them.
What that really tells us is ResistBot is mostly used by white, educated and/or politically engaged liberals. Warren pretty much dominates that voting bloc.   Your username is hilarious, btw.
YES! In my state the progressive candidate for governor lost in the primary to the moderate candidate in 2018, and the week before the primary saw a lot of people switching their votes because they thought that the moderate was more likely to beat the heavily disliked third dem candidate. It was all based on inaccurate polling, and it became clear when the votes were counted that this disliked candidate never had a chance of winning anyway so people should have voted their conscience.
It's hard to say the media is "pushing" Joe Biden when he's leading in the polls. Do you really think they'd just not cover a progressive if they were leading? If it were Bernie leading the polls that would probably be great for ratings. CNN would eat it up.
At the end of that page it says it weights each group down to proper proportions.  They just wanted better margins-of-error for those targeted groups.
> Warren or Bernie. There are no other candidates for President.  Don't be ridiculous. Even a moderate democrat like Biden would be infinitely better than Trump.
Every single candidate has something Trump can say over and over again, and relatively speaking, people don't remember the whole Pocahontas thing.
Nothing. Don't respond. Don't even blink. Pocahontas isn't a name that can really be used to smear someone. A low information voter in PA will think it sounds like a funny nickname and have pleasant connotations with the Disney movie. It isn't a slur to be called one of the Disney princesses and honestly if that's the best controversy Trump can drum up then Warren's already won that debate.
Are they not selfies? What's the proper use of the term?  There's no real winning with this one. You call them selfies, snide people say "cringe! Hello fellow kids!" You call them photos, they say "wow, what a stiff robot, who wants to have a beer with her, am I right?" Not saying you're one of those people, but I'd rather she be legit and call them what she wants to call them, rather than asking a focus group if the word selfie is "cringy."
While I generally agree, a selfie is a picture you take of yourself, I think the term has generally changed to a "picture with yourself in it", regardless of who actually takes the picture.
I find it endearing lmao. It's also probably purposeful branding, 'selfie' sounds more warm and welcoming than 'picture'
What if she doesn‚Äôt get the Senate though ?
His ‚Äúthings won‚Äôt fundamentally change‚Äù comments did it for me. I want someone who stays climate change seriously.
Harris is a greater risk than Biden losing. She doesn't motivate the left in the way either Bernie or Warren do, and she doesn't motivate the center anymore than Hillary had done. It's also not clear that she mobilizes black voters anymore than Hillary or Biden would.  Generally speaking, I think she's the biggest risk out of all the front runners in terms of losing to Trump.
I am still pretty new to this "actively involved in politics" thing. So I am still trying to get my bearings.  What do you think of a Warren/Pete ticket? It feels a bit like Pete might be able to pull together the Midwest, and I personally love the way he phrases his comments and the worldview that is implied by it. But I think there are a lot of good reasons why he should not get the President ticket in 2020. But I wonder if he would do well as a VP?  Any thoughts?
To be clear. I don't think any of the candidates will lose the popular vote. I think it will be a CLEAR majority vote for whoever runs against Trump even after the Propaganda, the Russian interference, and the voter registration purges and lost ballot boxes. But I DO think it will be a struggle to win.  All of the interference won't change a ton of votes, but it will change very specific votes which will make beating Trump a serious challenge. It is doable, but NOT if we think we have it in the bag.
Biden's way more conservative than Clinton.
But if it comes down to it, still better than trump.
Clinton 2.0 but way worse
Ehh, I think Kamala is Clinton 2.0. Biden is worse than Clinton.
He‚Äôs the answer to the rich and powerful‚Äôs question: What‚Äôs a *safer* choice than Hillary Clinton?
6. He‚Äôs from a ‚Äúgood‚Äù (read white) religion.
The same effect that propels Biden might be his downfall. Downward trends are also self fulfilling, since his poll numbers dropping will hurt his image as "electable," and instigate further drops.
Thanks for canvassing! Here in Iowa I'm seeing a lot of early support for Warren. Regarding polling/electability. I agree with much of what you've written above. I'd tell these people that electability isn‚Äôt a static social fact; it‚Äôs a social fact we‚Äôre constructing. Part of what will make someone unelectable is people give up on them in a way that would be premature, rather than going to the mat for them.

Just to inform, [Biden has a history of racism](https://medium.com/@westonpagano/a-guide-to-the-2020-democratic-candidates-you-should-not-vote-for-c1c6e4c9c26) among many other issues, he's not the least bit innocent
I literally told my mom a couple weeks ago that he‚Äôs like if my grandpa ran for potus
>FWIW, the party is evenly split between people who identify as liberal and who identify as moderate or conservative.  Out of curiosity are you basing this assertion on anything in particular?  And regardless, it misses a major consideration which is that there are far more people that don't vote than there are Democrats in the country. When considering how to message we should be considering how to engage and inspire them, not just established dems, and I doubt that the "more of the same" rhetoric is going to work for them considering that it hasn't engaged them in the past.
I‚Äôm 26 but I guess I‚Äôm not allowed to be surprised
>Most people have stable jobs/income. They don‚Äôt want massive changes that create threats to their jobs or life style. If they can vote for the guy that will make their life marginally better but also not changing much, they will. People like having the comfort of sameness.  There's a lot to unpack here. First stable job/income does not mean a good job with a high income. Underemployment is a huge problem, and costs for things like childcare are rising much, much faster than wages. [One survey](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/98918/material_hardship_among_nonelderly_adults_and_their_families_in_2017.pdf), for example, found that despite a relatively low average unemployment rate of 4.4% in 2017 many families (\~40% in this survey) reported financial hardships that year in food security, housing stability or utility payments, or healthcare. Many people who work full-time or more are struggling, and very few are anything more than comfortable.  And beyond that, plenty of people who may not be struggling themselves vote for things beyond their own pocket books. They vote for their children's futures, they vote for their communities, and they vote their values. And many don't vote at all, because they don't see a difference in the impacts on their own families between conservative democrats and conservative republicans.  I have spent years now organizing in a blue state that nearly went for Trump in 2016, not because more Republicans showed up, but because farmers, low-wage workers, and students drowning in debt didn't see the point in voting for someone that wouldn't make big changes. I think you're severely underestimating the thirst for change in this country. Unfortunately in the general election in 2016 Trump was the change candidate.
The average American lives paycheck to paycheck and has little invested in their retirement.  I don‚Äôt think the average American is financially stable.
That's very much an outlier poll.    The average of all the polls is Biden 29.3% and Warren at 14.5%, 0.5% behind Bernie.    https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html   I don't like when outlets report just one poll, it is very misleading to what the reality of them situation actually is.  And I don't think that's healthy or good for anyone.     I don't doubt Warren is well liked, how can you not like her, she's awesome.  But that doesn't mean she's anywhere close to Biden.  If you add up Bernie and Warren's support, you get a statical tie with Biden.     I just fear that reporting on outlier polls encourages people to stop trying as hard as they should to get their candidate nominated.
I agree, a lot of comparisons of Warren to Hillary are based on assumptions about "smart, strong women" and likability (with some explicit sexism), despite the fact that Warren is a very different person, much more charismatic, with better on policy.  &#x200B;  Likability is helpful for the electability argument.
> low information voters in Wisconsin, Florida, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are going to vote with their gut  Can confirm. Pennsyltucky here (where the Amish roam) and there's so many people here that vote against their best interests. The problem isn't that they're low information voters, it's that they're Fox News voters. I work for a religiously affiliated credit union and overheard two guys I work with complaining about Mueller's report saying he found absolutely nothing and he needs to shit or get off the pot. They didn't know anything really about the Flynn, Manafort, etc guilty pleas. That the report paid for itself in civil forfeitures. They only got the points from Fox. I guess that makes them "low information" on a standard scale but they have too much wrong information which is the problem.
It is, but keep in mind, in an Elizabeth Warren subreddit, you‚Äôre only going to here about the polls that show the best results for her. You‚Äôre not going to hear about all the other polls that aren‚Äôt as good. Good news is if you look at all the polls, Warren is the only top candidate who has consistently risen in the polls month over month. Biden slipped. Sanders slipped. Harris spiked after the debate then fell back a bit, but so far Warren has slowly just kept rising. At the rate she‚Äôs going she‚Äôs still a long way off from catching up with Biden, but it is possible.
Bingo. That‚Äôs why Warren is top by far and Biden is below Yang lmao
Exactly. We also know that polling is easily manipulated by candidates. We know that Michael Cohen (Trump's personal laywer and fixer) was hiring firms to rig major polls. https://thehill.com/homenews/news/425785-cohen-hired-firm-to-try-to-rig-online-polls-for-trump-only-paid-part-of-bill  It's so easy to talk about polling data especially when it's positive news, but in doing so I think we are ignoring larger problems in how polling data affects political discourse and creates self perpetuating narratives about candidates that can swing votes and get people to vote against their own self interests.
Sorry, I missed that.
Ehh I dont agree, I think many people at least will remember it when it is brought up. If Warren is able to cannibalize the Bernie Bros then she will have a serious shot. It all depends on if the Bernie fans get equally excited for her. Anyways it ll be an interesting race for sure üëç best of luck
Selfie, as I understand it, is a photo taken by someone of themselves, hence the term. But clearly I must be in the minority for finding it an odd term to use here, so I'll let it be.
She‚Äôs cannibalizing ‚Äústatus quote joe‚Äù and I‚Äôm pretty sure if the choice were warren or trump, Bernie supporters would chose warren.  Most of what trump has done is in executive order which is easily undone - but not so easily fixed in terms of stopping future bad presidents from doing bad things.
I think Pete is a great guy but afaik he isn't running for state office because he doesn't think he would win, so I don't know how much value he adds to the ticket.   My other bigger issue is that VP exists in case something happens to POTUS, and I'm not sure he has enough experience for that
Pete has too much baggage, and is too polarizing. There's a large number of democrats who *really* don't like Pete (his plan to remove blight, income inequality in South Bend, and his evasion of these topics being some of the reasons), and he has abysmal relations with the African American community (which is key for Warren).  Also, frankly, he seems like the kind of guy who doesn't play as well from second place. This isn't an insult, far from it actually, but if he was on the ticket he would draw more attention than a VP should.  This isn't my pick, but I would imagine someone like Castro could get the nod. Younger, minority, strong ideals but not too noisy. Not a milquetoast candidate, but someone who's unobjectionable, and happy to work *for* Warren, rather than side by side with her.
Careful not to trip over that bar.
Clinton wasn't liked, but if you look at both her voting record and her policy position I'd say she was significantly more progressive than Biden, she was just pragmatic about what could and couldn't be accomplished at what time, perhaps a little too much so to be inspiring.
This is insane. I'm a huge Warren fan and want her to win (check my posting history if you wish to confirm), but Biden is clearly a much stronger candidate than Clinton. He is more charismatic, he is more authentically blue collar, he has more chemistry with the very popular Obama, and he isn't married to someone with a highly questionable sexual history.
Kamala is more exciting than Clinton at the very least.
You'd think the safer(tm) choice would be someone like Harris or Buttigieg. Warren has some faults like the whole DNA thing or being too far left for centrist. But Harris and Buttigieg don't have those problems. They're left of center and very reasonable, likable personalities. Biden, not so much. He's crass and dismissive. Experience, yeah. But that only gets so far in a presidential election.   However, Warren has quite the personal background and most interesting story out of all of them though. Her history as a professor and being a champion for something she believes in got her to Congress and she's fought all the odds. I can see why she's liked by so many. She definitely captures my attention.
Their slightly unsafe choice but still extremely safe in terms of economic policy is Buttigieg
He was also *really* slow in combating Trump over Ukraine. That CBS poll said that people were more satisfied with Warren combating her smears than Biden.
Lol, you think Biden was being honest? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Obama said no, not yet, for sure. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Yeah, just like my grandfather
There was a Gallup poll recently that found something like 51% described themselves as liberal while 49% described themselves as moderate or conservative. It was notable for being the first time a majority said they were liberal, but it‚Äôs still an even split.  That assumes that people who don‚Äôt vote prefer less moderate candidates, which I believe polls have shown is not typically the case. People who lean Democratic but isn‚Äôt vote we‚Äôre more moderate than those who did vote for Hillary. A big reason often cited for Hillary‚Äôs defeat was a decline of minority turnout. But what a lot of people miss is that voters of color tend to be the most moderate members of the party. I think there was a NYT article about that recently but there have been various polls too.  My opinion is that going left to energize the base is wishful thinking. Going to far could alienate some, but I think the determining factor is the candidate‚Äôs campaigning abilities rather than his/her policies being a little more to the left or right.
While I agree, that doesn‚Äôt disprove my point. This country elected Bush twice over much better alternatives. We also elected Trump. There‚Äôs even concern he could beat Warren when she is 1000x better for our country. It‚Äôs sad.
On the contrary, I think this is an indicator that things look good. Polls are largely worthless, but when people are asked who they *like* instead of who they'd supposedly *vote* for, I think you get a more valid response (i.e. finding what you're looking for).   American politics is a popularity contest at its core. We have a chance to elect the honor student over the bully, and I think we'll do it.
I think it encourages supporters to see good polls because then they know that their support is having a meaningful impact. True this may be an outlier but that doesn't mean we can't take a little comfort from it.
I grew up in Bradford county, I know exactly the people you're talking about!   My uncle was going on about the "socialist" dems, when my nephew actually piped in that he liked "that one from Oklahoma who kind of acts like my principle". Warren has been lucky to stay above the turbulence so far. Weirdly enough not going on Fox News seems to have kept them from talking about her that much.
Yup. And there's quite a bit of international precedent for banning polling or election surveys for some amount of time before election day, so it wouldn't be completely outrageous to consider, although I imagine media companies would be less than thrilled about such a proposal.
Every candidate has something - remember, it doesn't have to be true or relevant or in context. Donald Trump is a liar, and his core fans believe his lies.   John Hickenlooper was partially correct - that they'll call us socialists if we embrace socialist policies. What he failed to note is that they'll call *everyone* socialists - it doesn't have to be true, or "real socialism", or even on close to the same level as the countries like Venezuela they're fear mongering us about. Do we really think that Donald Trump will get on the debate stage with any other candidate and have a moral quandary about making up lies about that person? Whether it's dragging up "Pocahontas", or calling Bernie Sanders a socialist, regardless of who's up there, Trump will fight with his fists and teeth and claws. The issue I have with your comment is you're comparing "Pocahontas" to this imaginary person who lies can't be created about. That person does not exist. Mother Teresa could be the Democratic candidate and he'll figure out something to tell his base about her, and they'll just eat it up. Absolutely zero way around it.
I'm REALLY hoping for a Warren/Castro ticket.
That sounds like really good reasoning. I'll pay closer attention to him in tomorrows debates. I had already moved him to the back side of my list, but only because I did not like him attacking other Democrats during the debates.  With so many people, and no where close to enough time to give proper research to every single one, falling behind can be really arbitrary and stem from just one bad day.  So Castro and Booker are ones to keep an eye on for a potential VP pick. Though, I am sure there is lots of talent not on the presidential debate stage.  Thanks for the chat.
A good VP pick would be someone with clear connections to the midwest states that Trump had won and that isn't Castro. Regardless of who the nominee is, expect people to talk about Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey or Tammy Baldwin.
For me, it depends on how things shape up.  If the final two are Warren & Biden, then yes, one of the younger VPs would be preferrable as I very much want a 16 year run. Beto is probably my first choice of Buttigieg, Castro and O'Rourke. Although I'd LOVE to see Pete debate Pence.  But yes, mainly because I think Beto would be the most help in Florida. I think Castro would be a liability here because I feel like that name might be poison with the Cuban community, especially with the more leftward candidacy of Warren.  But that'd require O'Rourke actually getting his campaign in shape.  If it comes down to Warren & Harris, I can see a party unity ticket of the two.
Buttigieg is too polarizing, so it should instead go to someone who wants to decriminalize illegal border crossings? Whether you support that policy or not, it's ridiculous to believe it isn't inflammatory to a lot of voters, including a lot of swing voters.
If you‚Äôve ever wondered if Elizabeth Warren could knock Trump into oblivion, tonight is your answer because she absolutely annihilated Bloomberg. He may never walk again. I tried to tell y‚Äôall @ewarren will whoop Trump‚Äôs ass. Been screaming it. She‚Äôll DESTROY Trump.
How many women have wished they could call out harassers and abusers in the workplace like that?? Holy shit, that was like watching a fantasy come to life.
I once saw a baseball player hit a 500 foot home run. What happened to Bloomberg tonight  probably felt about like that ball felt at the moment of impact.
Yang Ganger here.  Just came by to say congratulations on a great debate performance by Liz.  She‚Äôs lost some steam in the polls in the last couple of months, but she came back big time tonight in my eyes.  Partly for her knocking down Klobuchar a few pegs, but especially her takedown of Bloomberg.  Bravo Liz!  He may never walk straight again.
This is the Warren we all needed. So proud of her.
An absolutely incredible performance. This will be remembered as the day Bloomberg‚Äòs candidacy died. We saw one candidate prove today that she can put an asshole billionaire in their place, and that was Liz Warren. Frankly, she deserves the presidency even if she only got the Bloomberg ads removed from my podcasts.
Warren does the most damage to trump hands down
Bloomberg looked like a deer in headlights tonight.  I just hope he will continue his pledge to put money in the election.
I've seen nothing but praise even from the diehard Bernie fans I've seen she did so good they were like 'I can't even lie'  that was just fire. absolute fire, the best political event i've watched all year, if not my entire life
I was so hyped for tonight because of this. I knew she absolutely despised him (for many, many good reasons) and she has been the queen of zingers this whole campaign (imo) so this was a perfect recipe. Add in that she properly foreshadowed it by saying it's a dry run for running against Trump \*chef's kiss\*
First John Delaney and then Micheal Bloomberg.   Followed by demolishing Amy, Pete, and Bernie on M4A on quick succession. That was some chaos.
She‚Äôs killing it!
We found out tonight that Bloomberg could not possibly beat donald in a debate, or even an election.  He had almost no reaction when warren accused him of saying those things.  He didn't even object.  That's the difference between him and trump, and a big reason he could never beat trump:  trump will enthusiastically deny everything, no matter how much proof there is to the contrary.  If it were donald up there instead of Bloomberg he would have started shaking his head, waving his hands, and interrupting Liz saying "No no no I never said that" as soon as she claimed he did.  And Trump's supporters would have loved him for it, and probably even believed him.  But bloomberg sat there and took it, which was basically an admission of guilt.  Trump would have reacted that way because Trump has no shame.  Bloomberg does.  And that's his biggest weakness against someone like Trump, and the biggest reason he could never win.  He'd just sit there and let Trump tear him apart on national television.
Warren supporter here! She fucking took names tonight.
I'm a Bernie guy, but I just had to come over here to agree with this.  Warren was out for blood tonight, and what I saw on that stage was absolute *murder*.  She may have just ended Bloomin' Onion's run - that was fucking amazing.
Warren bought the fire tonight, no denying. She won the debate hands down.
Yoda when the lightsaber come out.     She's pretty zen until she decides otherwise and these other candidates took that for granted.     I think Amy Klobuchar is to thank.  She might've been reluctant as a woman to go too hard but Amy seemed to not get penalized so... Why not. Hit em in the mouth.     I also love that she isn't tiptoeing around bernie anymore.
She. Was. Unstoppable.
The gloves are off
Anyone got a donor link?
I think she showed she can take on Trump. She‚Äôs a fighter and it‚Äôs good to see her channel that into the debates. I‚Äôm hoping she hit her stride tonight.
Huge Bernie supporter, but Warren won this debate. My god, what a pummeling. I already wanted Warren as my second choice, but after tonight there is no doubt in my mind that she would absolutely destroy Trump in an election. She greatly elevates this democratic race.
Im watching and GOOD LORD! Where has this Liz been?!   I mean the NDA argument alone. WHEW!
I admit I‚Äôm a Sanders supporter but I absolutely agree she would destroy him.  I kinda want to see Warren win just to witness it.
Bernie supporter here, just came over to congratulate y'all on a great debate. Warren has always been my second choice, and she definitely proved herself tonight.  We may have policy disagreements but there are two things we can all agree on: Fuck Trump and fuck Bloomberg.
Good thing Bloomberg had the backs of everyone he stands on to break his fall.
Link to clips showcasing debate?
I had an event today, anyone have a link to the full debate? I can‚Äôt find it anywhere
[removed]
I first was with Warren then switched to Sanders. I still am for Sanders but damn would I love to see Warren debate Trump.  I felt like I was watching Mortal Kombat during the debate with a sign over a wobbling Bloomberg that said FINISH HIM.   Right as Warren ripped his spine out ‚Äúso you will release the women from the NDAs‚Äù  SAVAGE
Bernie voter here but I just want to say that Warren kicked republican billionaire ass tonight! Hoowee that left a mark LOL!
anyone have any clips of this? i wanna see it
I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter that came over to say HOLY SHIT!! Liz is back baby!!  The entire bernie slack was going off at how Liz was clapping back! Incredible performance I think she‚Äôs making a comeback after that
I'm a Bernie supporter but God damn is Lizzy a bona fide warrior. I will follow her into Mordor if she's the nominee!
Anyone here play Devil May Cry?  As she kept talking I could see the Stylish rank going up in the corner of my mind.  Absolutely destroyed him. She's one of the best things to ever happen to this country.
Sadly this kind of thing won‚Äôt work when the opposition is republican. Most Democratic voters are rightfully shocked and appalled by the things Bloomberg has done and said, but we‚Äôve already seen that the same kinds of actions are readily accepted from republican candidates as long as they are pro life.
If only we can vote top 3 candidates.     My #1 was Yang, then #2 Sanders, and then #3 Warren.
I'm not sure whether Trump will be in the same situation as Bloomberg is now. Bloomberg is someone who wants votes of democratic voters, so when Warren attacks him she is battling mainly about votes of voters who don't want Trump in the office. With Trump she must persuade voters in swing states who could potentialy vote for Trump to vote for her. I'm not sure if she just won't alienate them.
I mean I‚Äôm not saying Warren will lose if she wins the nomination, but just bc they are billionaires does not make Bloomberg and trump the same. As awful as he is, we have seen trump can somehow deflect any attack at all.
[removed]
She channeled every accomplished woman who has been dismissed by a mediocre man.
Bloomberg probably thinks the Astros shouldn't apologize for anything.
Thanks! From past debate encounters, I think she likes Yang and would be open to incorporating him and some of his ideas into her platform.
I think Warren did very well tonight. Come on over to the Mega Thread and join us in the conversation.      [https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/f6h415/discussion\_thread\_ninth\_democratic\_primary\_debate/fi5uv0w/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/f6h415/discussion_thread_ninth_democratic_primary_debate/fi5uv0w/?context=3)
Fellow yang ganger here. I‚Äôm not aligned with Warren ideologically on a lot of things, but I do really appreciate that she thoroughly explains all of her idea and the reasons behind them.   (Warren or bust people stop reading here)  I think she‚Äôd make a very effective majority leader in the senate under a progressive president.
I wish I had your confidence in saying Bloomberg is done, but I'm worried he'll go to the end to prevent any candidate raising taxes on the rich.
I don't necessarily agree that Liz knocked Bloomberg out. But she did sharpen her sword to slice at his jugular.  Remember that this dude has money like God (he also believes himself to be one) and he is not to be just taken lightly. Most voters don't watch debates... (Especially since the Dems wait forever to get onto the good ones.) Bloomberg has to be hanged like Mussolini‚Äîwhether you want that to be metaphorical or not is up to you‚Äîhowever, Bloomberg will just push in more money to the higher-ups of NBC and continue his ads because the news media works like a business that needs to grow every quarter for management to keep their jobs.  This is a referendum on POWER that we are working on. Let's not be complacent. WE MUST PHONEBANK AND RAISE MONEY. WE MUST WORK TO **END** MR. RACIST-SEXIST-REPUBLICAN-BLOOMBERG.  Don't let posts like this make you complacent!
Hopefully Amy Who will be relegated to the sidelines where she belongs while Warren moves back to the front where she has always belonged. Same with Wall Street Pete.
He's totally outclassed.
If he does he'll be supporting Republicans.  Dude was a registered R until last year.
'she did not respect my authoritah...'
[removed]
I think I'm gonna grab a bottle of cava and watch it again tonight.
THAT WAS AMAZING. She gave 3 zingers and then came back and went into MORE DEPTH.
Trump won't debate. I'm convinced. Putin doesn't debate so why would Trump?  I assume, Bloomberg is also banking on Trump to no show, in hopes that they can engage into an election buying competition.
Two weeks before anyone votes for or against him, long though time for him to run 200 million in ads.
Am√©n, Lets get that expensive distraction off the stage. No more reality TV
You're welcome. If this is the moment that clears Bloomberg out of the way, and Bernie ends up taking it home, I will be happy (I still want her to win, to be clear, but I like the Bern too)
Same, I was a Warren supporter late last year, but Bernie now. Still been a Warren fan for years regardless. Man, Warren did ammmaazzing. Loved her take down of Bloomberg's bullshit. If she can make a come back, I could be persuaded to her side again. Bravo.
So Warren got the job done but you still wanna be a Bernie guy? Let's elect the person who's gonna be the best president and can eviscerate billionaire.   **hint hint** its Warren
I'm a Bernie girl, but tonight Warren completely blew me away. I had a huge respect for her already but tonight I realized it would be fun to see her debate with Trump.
So your a Warren supporter now right since you have seen what she can do? Bernies same old lines aren't gonna eviscerate the competition like she did
She‚Äôs been trying to navigate the misogynistic traps the media lay out for female frontrunners. Too shrill, too aggressive.   She could only have done this when counted out. She might still pay for it, but boy am I glad she went for blood and teeth.
Ya the policy disagreement I have is Warren has plans on how she will get her shit done and bernie has Hope's and dreams.    Hell she wasnt even a senator when she got the cfpb done.

She is making a comeback. Shes gonna take the nomination.
It would be an absolute dream to have a progressive at the top of the ticket.  Warren‚Äôs my number one, but I‚Äôd be skipping to the polls to vote for the Sandman if he‚Äôs our nominee
We aren't trying to win republicans we are trying to fire up dems. And she had everyone fired up tonight.
Yeah but you can ignore those voters in the general, no democratic candidate will win them.
That's my Girlfriend's order as well ...  I think a lot of us have this preference, I think the only place we really differ, is in our ultimate ranking.
>I mean I‚Äôm not saying Warren will lose if she wins the nomination, but just bc they are billionaires does not make Bloomberg and trump the same. As awful as he is, we have seen trump can somehow deflect any attack at all.  It probably is worth expanding on this. Warren would have to take a different line of attack to hit Trump than Bloomberg. Bloomberg still has an eye on making sure what she's saying is generally sort of true so that provides a stable anvil for Warren to hammer him against.  Trump is a slimy, pathological liar though so you can't nail him to the wall in the same way. He'll just flow from one insane statement to another. To drag him, Warren would need to give him enough rope to hang himself, bait him out into being ridiculous, and then make the audience feel like they're in on the joke as we laugh at his clownish antics. Trump is good at *non sequiturs* and distracting from his flaws by always being on the attack. So she'd have to be careful to ignore and shut down all the "Pocahontas" nonsense he'll throw her way and just focus on making him look like an insane fool.
No; just stop it.

great comment
What I tie in my man
Hot Take: Astros made Baseball more fun.
There are [very few](https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-poll-warren-biden-2020-nominee-emerson-college-1483831) Warren or Bust people:  >And 90 percent of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's supporters said they would vote for whoever is the nominee, while the remaining 10 percent said it depended on who won the nomination.
Him staying in will help Liz. I think she purposely withheld the Scott Brown thing.  I believe in my heart that Bloomberg got in this race to stop Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs wealth tax.   That is perfect. Right now the media attention will be about Elizabeth Warren and Bloomberg, and that is exactly what we need!!
No, she knocked him out.  Even if she can‚Äôt win the nomination herself, she just ensured that the DNC will do everything they can to throw it to someone other than him at the convention.   He would get crushed by Trump and she exposed it.
Denigrating other Democrats by calling them names is the wrong strategy.
Yeah, but that was only a small part of his life.  He has been a democrat for up until 2001, and though he didn‚Äôt endorse Obama in 2008 he still voted for him and then endorsed him in 2012 if I remember correctly.
Listen, this hurts my soul. But rule eight (civility) applies to every candidate. Thank you!
It really was good. Maybe this is just proof we were all thirsting for real substance or something but that was the perfect mix of watching candidates roast each other but also talking about useful issues.  I think the moderators did a great job by just letting them go, and giving people chances to speak/respond without cutting them off too early. It was just good all around. It was run a lot better than others I've seen.
Let him waste his money.  The news will be running this drubbing for the next week.
:D
I tend to prefer Bernie's policies, thanks - though if Warren wins the nomination I will enthusiastically campaign for her in the general and *quite happily* vote for her.
No, I still think Bernie is the best choice. I was excited by Warren's performance. Because her and Bernie share so many political views, when either of them do well it is good for progressives on both sides. Bernie will beat Trump as well and his track record is longer than Warren's so I feel he is a safer bet to hold true to the ideals he campaigned on. I don't back Warren first, not because I don't think she is a great candidate, but because I am worried she will not galvanize the country as well as Bernie will and her recent performance in Iowa and NH seems to support that theory.  However, to reiterate, I would be extremely excited if Warren won the nomination. She is a great candidate.
The Bloomberg fans on my Facebook are already doing the misogyny routine and saying she looked ‚Äúwild-eyed‚Äù and ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù  Utterly predictable and disgusting
She went for broke. She needs to keep this same energy. People want to know that she has the fire to beat Trump.
Removed: Civility.     Let's not use one group of people as a negative comparison for another group of people.
They're the only 2 I'd actually be proud to vote for, I'll vote dem anyways except if it's Bloomberg then I'm staying home.
Agreed.
This is how Democrats lost in 2016. Don't reflexively give up on groups of peoples' votes before the election.
My point was more that it‚Äôs a different ball game and debating Bloomberg doesn‚Äôt prove or disprove her ability to do so
[removed]
Not hot take: cheaters don't make anything fun
I meant more the people that reject anything negative about Warren. I originally phrased it ‚Äúcrazy Warren supporters‚Äù but thought that would be met with some hostility.
I was waiting for her to go after him for funding Scott Brown and then realized it would have been a tactical mistake. No reason to make anyone think her criticism of him was personal. She focused on his massive vulnerabilities in a general election and hit every mark.
Petition to make Bailey Warren the official mascot of r/ElizabethWarren
Fun fact about the hat she's wearing! It says Berkshire Community College, and in 2015 she spoke at my graduation from there, and we gave her that hat as part of a thank you present. FOUR YEARS AGO! And she's still wearing it!
Where do I sign!
I'm reading Warren's books and it's apparent that dogs play a very important role in her family life.  I believe her first dog is called Good Faith, which is a gift from her Havard students. Then there's Otis, a napping champion who loves food. And now Bailey, whose only job is to be cute which he does so well.  It's such a trivial character trait until you realize that her future opponent Donald Trump has zero animals in White House ‚Äî ***zero!*** I don't know if it says anything about a person but I feel as though being able to love animal signals a person's ability to give compassion to the world.
I think this is my fave Warren pic now!
She is a cooked, dirty cheater.    How much influence does that puppy have over her?  Are we even sure that puppy is an American??
I agree. And it should say DOTUS (Dog Of the United States) below it.
"That's America's good boy."
Yes
Really is a dang dang dang cute dog
That's a good doggo!
**#Bailey2020**
hot take but tbh   https://splinternews.com/elizabeth-warren-put-your-beautiful-dog-in-the-trash-1835052790
Honestly, she‚Äôs too good to be true
Cute, but kinda didn't expect Liz to be that basic. Lol.
That is really sweet.
I can confirm that she still wears it regularly, and bailey is much bigger now
It's a nice hat.
Her doggie is big af now, so I‚Äôm guessing she took this photo several years/months ago
This makes me happy, but also disappointed. I was silently hoping that it was a Berkshire Hathaway hat and there'd be some silly political drama about big money, Warren Buffet, whether she's trolling, etc.
As someone from the Berkshires in Williamstown & Pittsfield, I‚Äôm ALL for her hat.
^ lol blatant bias
I don't trust people who don't like animals.
Which book do you recommend reading first?
It‚Äôs a Scottish immigrant, probably living here for free while simultaneously stealing a job.
A lot of influence...some say too much...heard Bailey gets <whispers> cheese once a day!
Kibble tax, BellyRubs 4 all, and New federal minimum pets were all my ideas.
Heckin' good boy. 11/10, would definitely pet in the primaries.
To be fair, Warren Buffet probably doesn't care if his bajillion dollars gets taxed at 2%.
I'm from Pittsfield and work at BCC now and we all appreciate it there! I even got her to talk about BCC at her last Keene town hall since I got to ask a question, and she said she still wears it regularly!
Definitely ‚ÄúA Fighting Chance.‚Äù As her memoir, it is a good starting point, and gives context for her other books.
I would say "Fighting Chance" because that's more accessible for most people. It's a mixture of memoir interlaced with a vivid explanation of how broken the American financial system really is.  Then, I would highly recommend "Two-Income Trap." This is a book for the wonks, full of numbers and human stories collected from research. I would say if you can digest this one, you've pretty much understood what Warren is thinking about 24/7. After reading this book, I feel like I can finally explain the financial crisis to a 5-year-old.
LOCK HER UP.......... IN HER KENNEL.
AND GIVE HER THE WATER.......... BOARDING.
John Legend to campaign for Elizabeth Warren in South Carolina
RSVP links now on sidebar, menu bar, and discussion thread if you want to see him!
See now that's awesome. Things were tough in NH, but how were we really supposed to compete with what was basically a free Strokes concert? That looked so fun!  Hoping they can get the word out about this!
Thank god.  Tbh some of the early endorsers got real quiet over the last few months, and this is a sign that there‚Äôs renewed confidence!   Elizabeth Warren is cool again.
HELL YEAHHH
Yes! Thank you, Mr. Legend!
But will he play a few songs at the stump speech?
I was wondering when he would start. Thought it was odd he hasn‚Äôt been more involved.
I‚Äôll always be a fan from now on!
YEA!
If you haven't seen the [video](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) of Legend serenading Warren. Check it out!
legend.
HEEEELLLLLL YEAH!
John!   (I kinda hate his music but I‚Äôll love him forever now)
What an absolute Legend
Woohoo! Go Warren. I'd love her or Bernard in the White House. Hopefully the last debate got things rolling for her!
great soulful social justice musician for the best candidate!
Of course he is.
>how were we really supposed to compete with what was basically a free Strokes concert?  A free Hamilton performance
I‚Äôm a Sanders supporter, and I really love the respectful nature of all the Warren supporters I‚Äôve met so far. But bruh, a fucking Strokes concert. It looked awesome!
Lol easy pal, idk about cool, but she did roast Bloomberg's balls on open fire on Live TV so yin, yang
Sounds like it. From the article:  > He is also expected to perform, according to a Warren aide.
What????? How did I miss this??
I haven't experienced something like this in a veeeerrrrrry long time. Nice.
Oh man that‚Äôs my new favorite song! Thanks!!!
How could I have missed this!  Beautiful
That is beautiful!! LFG!
Haha man you are really committed to this thing, huh?
I can't name a single John Legend song, but I will dutifully give him a listen on the drive home.
The lead singer of Airborne Toxic Event is a Warren supporter. I mean not remotely as popular as The Strokes but they could do something possibly.
As a Liz supporter myself, honestly all of the different candidates' supporters have been extremely respectful! We all know what's on the line in November, and if he ends up being the nominee I will happily support Bernie.  Except Tulsi supporters. They're just weird.
I mean that‚Äôs pretty rad in my book.
Too bad Yang is out. He brought out refreshing ideas when he got to talk
I‚Äôm hoping that a musician arms race amongst political campaigns becomes a thing.
I'm in self quarantine after returning from Asia. I did and hopefully still do work in Beijing. I left shortly before Wuhan was quarantined, for an already payed for vacation in other parts of Asia. Anyway I just got back a week ago and I'm very bored. Today I am rick rolling  I'm not a subscriber here, just found this post on rising. Go Warren, she's my first pick. She's a bad mammajamma with a plan.   You should know this is the political sub that has responded the best to being Rickrolled ‚ù§Ô∏è
He‚Äôs never gonna let it go
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard at least a couple.   [All of me](https://youtu.be/450p7goxZqg) was a popular one but my favorite one is the new version of the [Beauty and the beast by him and Ariana Grande](https://youtu.be/axySrE0Kg6k).
Start a Fire was a pretty kickass single from the La La Land soundtrack that Legend did. Even though it's supposed to be the song Ryan Gosling sells out to, it's kind of a banger.
His christmas album is pretty good.
Crazy how different people's musical worlds can be. I'll never forget the first time I heard the song "Just to Get By" by Talib Kweli and Kanye West. John Legend was on it and I knew immediately he was going to be big. Would stop talking about my anticipation of his first album to my mom after that.  His first album is maybe in my top 30 albums of all time. And I love his 2nd album too. I always say that if he had been in a different era, the song "Ordinary People" would be one of the classics.   I haven't really liked a whole lot of his stuff after his second album but I've seen him live. He's a phenomenal performer. Plays the hell out of a piano and can sing his ass off. Not a good dancer though.
Yang was great, but I did have issue with his foreign policy knowledge. That said, national income is a great idea.
Trump's D list musicians at the general would be both sad and hilarious.
Fair enough. Sorry to hear about your quarantine troubles.   I just found it funny that after however many years people are still rickrolling. But enjoy! And best of luck to you.
I hope you are feeling perfectly fine and are enjoying your down time. And  thank you for the chuckle.
This is hilarious because it's so unexpected. Thanks for the real life lol.
I hope everything goes ok for you. Thank you for stopping by.
üèÖ
I loved his cover of Arcade Fire‚Äôs ‚ÄúWake Up.‚Äù
Wait, Legend was on Get By? I‚Äôll have to listen again.
It‚Äôd just be Ted Nugent and Kid Rock
I actually love being rickrolled. It always puts a smile on my face
Yeah. He sang the hook. And if you like just to get by and haven't heard John legend's first album you're in for a good time. Shits fire.
I'm honestly surprised that not even country artists have come out to support the guy. Usually Nashville loves their Republicans.
Media Hypocrisy on Elizabeth Warren's Employment History
53 billion / 39 million = 0.07% of Bloomberg's total wealth spent on ad buys  If you have 500 dollars in your bank account and don't own a house or any stock, when you buy a 5 dollar latte from starbucks you spend a larger percentage of your total wealth than Bloomberg did. By an order of magnitude, in fact.  And yet the media narrative is "My god, Warren made a million over 30 years as a legal expert!"
I mean, for real. In 30 years, I could say I made $1.2 Million as a teacher. It sounds like a lot, but over 30 years, its really not.
The spin she has been having against her by the mainstream media is sickening. It's the exact corruption she calls out every public appearance. Keep fighting friends!
The media had this flaw with Hillary/Trump. The media only cares about these things if the candidate pretends to have any sort of standards
To be honest I think how much Warren was paid isn't that important but for a corporate lawyer it looks like she was underpaid. Did Warren take off long periods of time to look after her kids or did she have other jobs at the time? Over 30 years I would have expected at least double or triple that amount.
Man remember a couple months ago when the narrative was "The media is giving Warren too much positive coverage because most reporters are in her demographic"? What happened.
If she's a SOCIALIST then explain how she has MONEY
Human beings have a real issue understanding the enormous difference between million, billion and trillion.  Side note:  @ One dollar a second, you become a:  Millionaire - 11.5 days  Billionaire - 32 **years**  (God forbid) Trillionaire - **32,000** years
the Pete Buttigieg Lis Smith smear campaign continues...  https://twitter.com/Lis\_Smith/status/1204223233878347776?s=20
its like we dont know the rich are cancer of the planet
[Boy, did my write-up make a splash the other day when I called out the Political Operatives' strategy, trying to disrupt Warren, mainly through posing as Sanders supporters](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/e74nml/suspected_campaign_from_russia_on_reddit/f9vofle/).  **Never** have I had such a controversial comment where >200 users spammed me, then continued stalking me to other subreddits for days. This in spite of it being one of my higher gilded comments as well.  I know this is slightly unrelated, but still... It's sort of indicative of just how much of a threat both centrists and right-wing operatives perceive her as being... A great sign in my book. After all, we saw how much Wall Street said about her.
Here's why this happened, Warren started polling in the lead.  That means she's going to see more negative pieces come out.  Which is fine, including those pushed by her opponents - if not especially those.  If we avoid attacking each other for the entire primary process then we leave all the ammunition of those attacks in the table for the GOP to use in the general.  Look at 2016.  Bernie: ‚ÄúI think the secretary of state is right, the American people are sick and tired about hearing about your damn emails." (Oct 2015). Fast forward almost exactly one year later, we are still talking about her damn emails and it's contributing to costing her the election.  If there is an issue out there that hurts Warren I want it out in the open in the primary not avoided, even if the attack is 'unfair'.

The billionaire owned media is not going to be kind, fair, accurate, or honest in it's coverage of candidates that wish to hold billionaires accountable for their many crimes. This should be expected.
Are the media treating Bloomberg as a serious contender? If not, then ignoring him makes sense.
The ironic thing is someone with Warren's educationnbackground is supposed to make 3.5 million over their lifetime. So Warren has actually earned less than she could
I'm going to be contrarian here. It's not media hypocrisy. They're reporting on it because this information just came out. It's new information and therefore is getting highlighted.  Besides, any media coverage of Bloomberg is generally accompanied by the fact that he's self-financing his campaign which is possible because he's extremely wealthy.
> If you have 500 dollars in your bank account and don't own a house or any stock, when you buy a 5 dollar latte from starbucks you spend a larger percentage of your total wealth than Bloomberg did.   I feel attacked   /s
Joke's on you. I don't have $500 in my bank account.
2 million, tyvm. She‚Äôs clearly an elitist billionaire monster
this is true, but ya'll realize he doesn't like have 53 billion dollars in cold hard cash. Its more like spread over his net assets and I'd waager a majority of his wealthy is in the stock market which is highly volatile
Yeah it averages out to about 80k/year
She took short term law jobs but primarily worked as a professor teaching law.
The people who own the media are in Bloomberg‚Äôs demographic is what happened.
She even eats FOOD and drinks WATER and has NICE THINGS
People keep posting this like it is some revelation, and maybe it's just me, but understanding the number 1,000 isn't that difficult?
I‚Äôm so tired of Pete. At times I like some things about him, but he makes extremely bad and disingenuous comments all the time. He sounds like a republican at times with no regard for the whole truth, just the parts that are convenient for him in the moment
The comments seem to be very critical of the tweet though, which is promising.
Is it deleted? Link doesn't seem to work.
It's the way the information is framed.
[deleted]
Agreed.  This is news because of who Senator Warren is and her "brand".  It's attempting to label her with a charge of hypocrisy.  I'm not sure I *buy* that argument.  But I think it's not a crazy argument and the comparison is kind of absurd.
This is true, but I‚Äôd gladly take his highly volatile net worth over my very stable negative net worth
I mean, sure... But not that hard to use.
Again, no one is saying we have a scrooge mcduck pile of money. We're just pointing out the scale of the vast difference in economic resources controlled.
Even less! 1,900,000/30 is only $63,333 per year.
By short term law jobs do you mean this work referred in the tweet or something else? Not knowing how much she did at each makes it difficult then to know if she was underpaid but I understand because I've done similar (not a lawyer, as an engineer).
That sounds a lot more racist than you probably intended.    I think what happened is they realized that her wealth tax is popular enough to be implemented regardless of who wins provided it isn‚Äôt Trump.  Given that likelihood they are trying to make anything associated with her so toxic that other candidates will not touch it.
Understanding the number 1000 is not the issue, it‚Äôs being able to visualize the massive difference between a million and a billion.   For most people, anything over a million is a huge sum, so realizing just how much more a billion is is hard to visualize.
I'm not tired of him as much as I am his comms director and her tenuous relationship with the truth.
The OP had a backslash in the URL for some reason. [It works once you remove it.](https://twitter.com/Lis_Smith/status/1204223233878347776?s=20)
Most articles I've seen frame it pretty reasonably. They state the facts -- Liz had some corporate clients and she made $1.9 million through it.   Do you see that much more coverage around it outside the small splash it made when she first released that data? Not really. I honestly think this is a case of journalists doing their due diligence, not some media hit job.
The *only* reason why it made any sort of headlines (and I'd argue largely minor ones) is because there's been a pretty public back-and-forth exchange between Buttigieg and Warren for transparency.  Warren demanded Buttigieg release his list of clients when he was at McKinsey. Buttigieg demanded Warren release her list of corporate clients when she worked as a lawyer.  *That* was what's public and high attention, not the fact that Warren made $1.9 million over three decades. Once it came out, the news was reported (and in reporting I've seen, quite fairly), and we've moved on. It made a very *small* splash.   Much like how Buttigieg had a Canadian grocery chain as a client is getting relatively little fanfare today.  It's reported because the exchange between the two candidates was pretty prominent, but in neither scenario, it's not like the released information was prime time news or blown out of proportion.  While challenging media bias or misbehavior is important, I also think it's important to not cry wolf every time and look at things with context and some objectivity.
true
The post actually already had a story attacking her for this 6 months ago that said she sometimes made $675/hr, which other lawyers promptly [pointed out was probably less than she was worth](https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/elizabeth-warren-legal-fees-lawyer-reactions.html) (with $700 around normal for relatively important partners).
It‚Äôs not a difficult concept. Wealthy women people own the media and have absolutely no interest in promoting a candidate who will make them considerably less wealthy.   Blumberg‚Äôs demographic is wealthy people. I see that you‚Äôre concerned that I am referring to Jews being Bloomberg‚Äòs demographic. If you hear people say ‚Äúpeople who control the media‚Äù and you think ‚ÄúJews‚Äù not ‚Äúwealthy people‚Äù, then you are the one being racist, not me.
He could just tell her to cut it out or replace her. As Warren says, personnel is policy...
I know we can't talk about other candidates but Lis Smith isn't a very good human being.
Except they've [played this story before](https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/elizabeth-warren-legal-fees-lawyer-reactions.html), just with her hourly wage rather than her total lifetime earnings.
Okay that's more in line with what I was expecting. When people were saying it was $50-$60k a year that seemed a bit odd.   Warren should push that $675/hr vs $700/hr to highlight the gender disparity. The $1.9 million is too vague to do that.
That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúprobably intended‚Äù as you likely meant wealthy people.  Regardless given the historical trope you should be more cognizant of how you phrase things.
I‚Äôve been waiting for this conversation and I‚Äôm not sure if we can have it here.
Not that anyone needs to shed tears for partners at top end firms, but there's a pretty significant gender pay gap: https://biglawbusiness.com/female-law-partners-face-53-percent-pay-gap-survey-finds
When talking literally about the people who control the media, how should I phrase it? Do you want me to say ‚Äúthe not-necessarily Jewish people who control the media‚Äù? Please tell me how you think I should do this with a specific example.
As Lis Smith is not a candidate, maybe? As long as it‚Äôs focused on issues rather than personal attacks.
And not just a pay gap.  The Staff -> Partner track is a hell of a lot harder for female attorneys
You could have said ‚Äúother wealthy people‚Äù or @fellow .1%ers‚Äù etc.
>As Lis Smith is not a candidate, maybe? As long as it‚Äôs focused on issues rather than personal attacks.  The comparisons to KAC aren't just based on her gender....
I see the problem here. I‚Äôm literally talking about how the people who own the media corporations influence what gets reported on the media. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúother wealthy people‚Äù or ‚Äúother 1%‚Äù. It would substantially change the meaning to write that.
Then you could refer to those with ownership of media companies.  By referring to his demographic you could be pushing that racist meme unintentionally.

Warren calls for legalizing marijuana, repealing 1994 Crime Bill, ending cash bail, and banning private prisons!
I didn't know what the crime bill was, so I looked it up:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent\_Crime\_Control\_and\_Law\_Enforcement\_Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)  Seems she's throwing shade at Biden by attacking that bill.  Overall, good for her.
Twitter is such a cesspool.
Yes please to all of that
There she goes THERE SHE GOES!!! STANDING OVATION!!!
I‚Äôd really like to see Warren as President with Dems controlling the full Congress
I had no idea something like cash bonds existed up until this point, pretty f***** up if you ask me.
Every candidate should have these views. Warren throws it down and that's my choice for president.
But ok: as president, would she (or anybody) be able to do any of this without Congress?
Yeee
At the very least, removing marijuana as a schedule I drug would really help Colorado and other states where marijuana is already legal. Right now, these businesses are prohibited from using any bank that's federally insured (i.e. all of them) so it's a cash only business. That makes it ripe for corruption and violence.

It‚Äôs the mandatory minimum bill, right?
**Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act**  The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, H.R. 3355, Pub.L. 103‚Äì322 is an Act of Congress dealing with crime and law enforcement; it became law in 1994. It is the largest crime bill in the history of the United States and consisted of 356 pages that provided for 100,000 new police officers, $9.7 billion in funding for prisons and $6.1 billion in funding for prevention programs, which were designed with significant input from experienced police officers. Sponsored by Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the bill was originally written by Senator Joe Biden of Delaware and then was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton.  Following the 101 California Street shooting, the 1993 Waco Siege, and other high-profile instances of violent crime, the Act expanded federal law in several ways.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Im glad she's throwing shade at Biden. While no one wants mudslinging, i feel like the Warren and Bernie have been hesitant to call out real and true flaws in Biden's Record.   It's time for the kid gloves to come off, it's not like trump will hold back.
And Sanders. He voted for it, and won't promise to repeal it either. I wish he would.   It's the Superpredator Bill FFS, he spent all 2016 throwing shade at Hillary over it...
> Title XI-Firearms, Subtitle A-Assault Weapons, formally known as the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act but commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban or the Semi-Automatic Firearms Ban, barred the manufacture of 19 specific semi-automatic firearms, classified as ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù, as well as any semi-automatic rifle, pistol, or shotgun capable of accepting a detachable magazine that has two or more features considered characteristic of such weapons. The list of such features included telescoping or folding stocks, pistol grips, flash suppressors, grenade launchers, and bayonet lugs.[2]  Not sure what to make of this section myself.. banning the manufacture of flash suppressors, pistol grips, and certain stocks?

I've been contemplating this lately.  Like on the one hand, the idea of fb/twitter/corporations policing speech on their platforms is kinda naturally gross. But on the other hand, the alternative is... Twitter. Which is not even usable at this point IMO. Its primary impact on the world is furthering Russian interests. Twitter is dead. It's a broken tool.  It's messy, but if businesses wanna put up a platform, they need to take responsibility for the misinformation their platform is used for. The "free market of ideas" will have to police the modding of the misinformation instead of the misinformation itself, because it honestly can't police the misinformation. That's pretty much beyond debate at this point...
Said on Reddit...
Really? It has been around forever. I have to say, this is not meant as an attack, but an observation. The existence of cash bail is something every poor, minority and working class person is extremely well aware of, hence the high number of bail bonds offices in downtowns, by the courthouse and in rundown  strip malls.   The idea that some people don't know that cash bail exists is astonishing to me, just because it indicates how wide the gap is between comfortable, well-off , well-meaning liberals and...the rest of society.    I mean, in my old neighborhood, people had the bail bond guy' s number on a fridge magnet along with the plumber's LOL.   I'm also not 100% sure eliminating it is a good idea (need to look into it some more), but I know Bernie called for it also.
Most of that can probably be done through executive action which may be enough. Otherwise, congress would need to pass laws.
Merely appointing an FDA head that would de schedule marijuana would be an enormous leap forward towards marijuana legalization.    It would protect medical patients nationwide from being fired due to a positive test.
Precedent says she could executive order it if needed due to the blatant abuse of that by Trump, Bush and even Obama. Then force legislation in action and it would be much tougher to pass new laws on any of those items. I am not for executive overreach but if there is no other way and it is for good, be a little FDR about it.
Sanders [voted yes for this bill](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll416.xml) its a complicated position for him.
This just in, no one can call for anything if bernie has already called for it
What‚Äôs not authentic about it?
> Not tryna be a downer here  Lol yes you are
He has. But I think some people are less trusting of him on this because he voted for the 94 Bill. Again, as a former Berner, I somewhat can understand his reasoning that it codified the Violence Against Women Act, but nevertheless, I think that made some people view HIM as inauthentic with regards to this particular issue (again, not my personal belief‚Äînot completely, at least‚Äîbut that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard).
Removed for Rule 1.
He def has called for repealing it and revamping our criminal justice system.
(Full disclosure) - Sanders supporter here, it should be mentioned that he absolutely lambasted that bill on the floor of Congress right before voting for it. He despised tough-on-crime legislation, but he felt obligated to vote for it because they snuck the Violence Against Women Act in there.
I'm no gun expert, but I'm pretty sure Bush undid that section.
you have got a point here. Most every progressive is in agreement that assault weapons should be banned. The trouble is not one of them can define what an assault weapons is.  It is not a .22 cal. that looks scary. Sure an ar15 is but what makes it so...if you can't do that you can't ban it. The I know it if I see it definition won't work.

Remake it.
Sacha Baron Cohen had a great speech about social networking as an avenue for bad actors while accepting an award from the ADL.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/sacha-baron-cohen-uses-adl-speech-to-tear-apart-mark-zuckerberg-and-facebook
I'd definitely like to be proven wrong about this, but I don't think I am. Can you provide a link where he said he'd repeal it?
He didn't though, I watched [that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTn3jUoMdVI).  He decries the poverty that makes people commit crimes. He says literally nothing against jailing them once they commit it. On the contrary, he embraces the premise: "clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them." And then promptly voted to jail them. It appears you found contrition in a speech that for me made it so much worse...  I hope you can accept what I'm saying for the facts it is based on, not some kind of toxic trolling. But to be honest, as a public defender and a person of color, this whole episode makes me want to huck Bernie Sanders out a window. I'm sure he's evolved from his 99% white electorate since then, but it's a black mark.
Warren supporter here‚Äî Yeah, I was for Bernie in 2016 and that was a common insult by the Clinton people. The bill‚Äôs impact was unforgivable, but the VAWA was vital and needed to be passed. While I can still be critical of Bernie for voting for it regardless, I think his reasoning and support for the VAWA is more defining of his character than the super predator bill.
There‚Äôs his own words about exactly that.  https://youtu.be/wuenGIA3YwI
the assault weapons ban had a ten year sunset and wasn't reauthorized by the republican congress.
The simplest method would be to ban all semi-autos above a certain caliber and large magazines. But that won't fly because people would FREAK out about a semi-auto ban of any kind. Unfortunately you're right, there's no clear cut definition of assault weapon. Guns that aren't banned have all the same capabilities as those that are, but get a pass because they don't look "assaulty."
This speech pushed me over the edge. I‚Äôve been inactive on Facebook but still maintained my account to see pics of my relatives etc.  I permanently deactivated my FB account 5 minutes after watching this when he gave it.    I don‚Äôt do the twitter or instagram thing otherwise I‚Äôd be deactivating it those too.
>This is not about limiting anyone‚Äôs free speech. This is about giving people, including some of the most reprehensible people on earth, the biggest platform in history to reach a third of the planet. Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach.  Yep this is what I'm talking about. People need to learn to distinguish between freedom of speech (from GOVERNMENT), and a free marketplace of ideas (from RULES OF ANY KIND). The former is irrelevant here. The latter fails constantly, and should always be qualified, in ways that plenty of our institutions already recognize. Court for example. Some things are "more prejudicial than probative" and you don't get to say them. You don't just throw all the words out there and let the best ideas win the jury. Some words are poison.
Thanks, I will check that out.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.axios.com/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-cnn-cc7320c5-719c-4756-b243-48152ebf3e64.html:This is where he states his regret.   https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/criminal-justice-reform/: This is his criminal justice plan. It calls for getting rid of three strikes laws and mandatory minimum sentences. His approach to criminal justice is one of the very reasons I didn‚Äôt vote for him in 2016, so I‚Äôm glad he evolved on this issue.
Devil's advocate:  If Warren's allowed to evolve her views from the 90s, so is Sanders.  Though I wish his more fervent supporters would stop acting like he's never made a mistake in his life...
Well, he says that "there are people in our society who are horribly violent (...) and clearly these people must be put behind bars." I don't think that's a controversial statement, it's a general remark. He doesn't speak out against jailing those people, because, well, those people should be jailed. I think I get what you're saying about embracing the wrong premise though. His language should have reflected the racist foundation of the bill and it didn't.   I believe his statement was intended to clarify a general belief that jailing people can make sense, but that we do it too often, too quickly and that our policies actively encourage a high prison population. In this speech, I do recognize statements against mass incarceration, like: "We already imprison more people per capita than any other country (...) All the jails in the world will not make that situation right." He had been arguing against mass incarceration even before that, [saying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZJ7f-3XGB4) about an earlier (1991) version of the crime bill, which he did vote against: "What we're discussing now is an issue where some of our friends are saying we're not getting tough enough on the criminals. But my friends, we have the highest percentage of people in America in jail per capita of any industrialized nation on Earth. We've beaten South Africa. We've beaten the Soviet Union. What do we have to do, put half the country behind bars?" And: "Let us be honest: This is not a crime prevention bill. This is a punishment bill, a retribution bill, a vengeance bill."  I don't want to turn this into a Bernie vs Warren debate, because this is Warren's subreddit and I'm a guest here! But I did feel you deserved a response. I can recognize your post as sincere, so don't worry: I don't see you as a troll.
At this point I would be happy with the large magazines ban, but that common sense measure can't even get a vote.
I feel like adding all semi-auto's to the NFA classification would be better than banning them. Pretty much regulate them to the point that they can't change hands and it takes forever to get one. But banning or regulating based on cosmetic features is dumb. Wood furniture on a gun  like the mini-14 shoots the same as an AR-15.     Which would force people to revert to:   * pump action side/side, over/under shotguns.  * Revolvers * Cowboy & bolt action rifles.
I think we both know neither of these says he will repeal it. Can you just be honest please. I don't mean to be rude, but what the hell.
\^\^\^See this is reasonable. The conversation should be about who evolved how, and what kinds of evolutions are/aren't comparable/okay. Not "it's okay when my guy evolves but everyone else is a shill." Angel's advocate!
Yes thank you re: troll‚ÄîI think we're doing a good job of avoiding a BvW thing. You seem cool. I just never know how someone will receive this stuff XD. For some it's like instant 10 on the rage scale.  Yeah I gotta say that 1991 Sanders sounds a whole lot better than the 1994 Sanders. I don't even need to qualify that, that's what I want to hear. I wish that was the Sanders who showed up in 1994. Even with your other 1994 quote‚Äîlet me put it in full context (I had to replay it myself when I listened to it):  >It is also my view that through the neglect of our government, and through a grossly irrational set of priorities we are dooming today tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence. And Mr. Speaker all the jails in the world‚Äîand we already imprison more people per capita than any other country and all of the executions‚Äîcan I ask for one more moment please? All the jails and executions in the world will not make that situation right.  "That situation" is the poverty again‚Äîthe neglect-to-prison pipeline‚Äînot over-jailing itself. He's saying it's treating the symptom instead of the cause and I'm saying no, it's arsenic. You see what I'm saying? Like I'd see him saying the same when voting for firefighter funding instead of a climate change bill ("all the firefighters in the world...").  Which is half-right and ahead of the curve, but half very, very wrong. You don't have to go to poverty‚Äîmass incarceration is a monstrosity in its own right that doesn't even succeed at preventing crime. We weren't talking about whether or not to "put the horribly violent behind bars" with that bill‚Äîwe had a thousand laws for that already. We were talking about a bill adding 60 crimes to the death penalty, enhancements to existing crimes like gang status, and made a three strikes life sentence system. We were talking, as a country where 98% were already paying to jail 1% and orbit another 1% around jail with parole/probation, about whether we should be jailing them 10x as long as everyone else or 5x as long. And it's not just nonviolent convicts and pot smokers‚Äîit's over-incarcerating almost every convict at every level. That is nuts, full stop. And honestly even then I think you could call this all nitpicking... except he actually voted for the bill and won't pledge to repeal it, despite bashing Hillary over it, and this all explains why.  It's not fatal, and his crime plan is üëåüèΩ üëåüèΩ. But you can see why it is a beef for me and a lot of people, yes?
You‚Äôre right that he‚Äôs not a troll, he in fact is a mod on this subreddit.
Do you know exactly what was in the crime bill? Because then you would see what is being reverse in his plan.
The problem is that some of these people literally think Bernie has been doing the exact same shit for thirty years. They forgot that he supported dumping nuclear waste near a Latino community in Nevada, or that the NRA has given him campaign money. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre going to tell them, because we‚Äôve all been sitting here trying to be allies to Sanders. But, the Russian troll base was more than happy to stoke the Sanders base with another conspiracy theory about Liz Warren.  https://inthesetimes.com/article/22091/trolls-twitter-discord-sanders-warren-wfp   So they come around with ‚ÄúBernie has been fighting for the same things his whole life. Warren CHANGED and she can change again!‚Äù   But Bernie has also changed. That is the nature of being progressive.
Just to clarify, /u/Mojojojo3030 is a frequent poster and has written some great analyses on Warren's policies, but he is not a moderator.
Yes, I do. I wrote [probably the most detailed piece on Warren's vs. Sanders's crime bills on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/cubroi/comparing_sanderss_and_warrens_criminal_justice/). His plan is excellent, but it neither promises to repeal the bill nor repeals the bill.  So you have nothing.
Yeah exactly. The lack of reciprocity and the double standards are both pretty poisonous. I have heard the "he's been saying the same thing forever" stuff from close friends even. Even after gently pointing out a few changes. I really think the term "socialist" flips a switch in certain heads that blacks out all nuance in a candidate.
True story, probably would be modding if I hadn't just started a clusterf\*\*\* of a job.   Thank you for the shout out though u/rorschach113 and u/zdss :).
Oops, coulda sworn he was.
Cool never mind this is not on good faith . Bye
Anyone else have a link to Sanders promising to repeal the superpredator bill? This guy is bailing. Calling the bill "awful" doesn't cut it, congresspeople say that about every compromise they strike and then never repeal.   Again, sincerely would like to be proven wrong here. I don't bite unless you mothball me with links that don't say it.
Yes. You most certainly are not engaging in good faith.
Apparently Warren is NEVER allowed to have fun AGAIN üôÉ
That same person said that she's starting to realize that Scott Brown made some good points against Warren all because she refuses to bow down to their Lord and savior.
If Bernie loses it‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt pull Moderates/non-ideological voters to his cause. You know... like Warren could.
Why is it Warren‚Äôs responsibility to make up for Bernie‚Äôs failure to expand his base? This is why I worry about the idea of Bernie in the general election, he seems like he has hit a wall in his support, and doesn‚Äôt know how to appeal to people who don‚Äôt already support him.
The frustrating thing is that a lot of Senator Sanders supporters are still in 2016-mode, when Sanders was running a campaign not to win but primarily focused on bringing issues to the national discussion. If you don't plan on winning, you can have a campaign about purity and righteous indignation and even taking on the Democratic party and other center-left and left factions.   Sanders doing unexpectedly well in 2016 was a pivot-moment, but it came too late to completely redefine his run. Now? He's running to win in 2020. He needs coalitions. He needs voters who supported other primary candidates like Mayor Buttigeig and Senator Warren, and he apparently needs them desperately. This doesn't mean he needs to compromise his vision and policies stemming from that vision, but it does mean Sanders supporters need to stop treating people like they're traitors or they want to eat poor people because we supported candidates like Warren or Buttigeig or even Biden. Seeing a hard-working progressive woman leader who essentially created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from sheer force of will, who's voted numerous times to help out students including to boost school funding and to tackle student loans, who has sponsored bills for equal employment and other major worker protections, who has fought for regulation of financial institutions, and votes for sanders 93% of the time called a snake or a neoconservative is really frustrating. Then seeing those same people clutch their pearls and get all offended when it's even suggested that misogyny might have played a role in Warren's primary performance is even more frustrating.   I'm going to vote for Sanders in spite of this group of people who think that bullying is the same thing as purity, should he win the nomination, but he's going to lose the primary if they don't change their tune quickly because Biden is getting closer to securing the nomination every day. And I'd be willing to bet my lunch that "blue no matter who" isn't enough to get enough progressives to vote for Biden.
The double standard is astounding. If she runs, it‚Äôs to Bernie‚Äôs detriment, if she drops out and takes time off of the race, it‚Äôs also to Bernie‚Äôs detriment. What the fuck. Apparently Bernie is so popular that he also can‚Äôt win on his own.  Also, at this point I don‚Äôt think Liz should endorse either candidate.
>iF sHe WaS a TrUe PrOgEsSiVe ShE wOuLd EnDoRsE bErNiE. sHe'S a SnAkE.  She doesn't owe you anything. Endorsing Bernie is a terrible move politically. Yeah, it's a political decision. Washington is like a giant middle school. If you want to make big structural change like she does, you can't just give the Democratic establishment the middle finger every day and then expect their help on your goals. Bernie has given the Democratic establishment the middle finger every day. What has that gotten him? Not much.  Also, how can someone both be a fake progressive for not endorsing Bernie, but also an election swaying endorsement with progressive street cred?
Lmao at Bernie begging her for an endorsement at the same time his surrogates and supporters are trashing her for going on SNL.   Why would we want any part of this movement, again?
There was a video posted in the Bernie sub of Elizabeth Warren speaking with Bernie and saying really nice things (the video was before she was in the Senate). All of the comments were trashing Elizabeth or her campaign. I don‚Äôt know how they expect Bernie to unite the progressive movement if they keep shooting him in his legs.
Good thing Warren dropped out. I was worried Bernie's supporters wouldn't be able to find another woman to blame for his campaign failing.
Not only are people still allowed to have fun, but it isn't an insane argument to point out that playing sax on Arsenio Hall may have been critical to Bill Clinton's road to the White House. Look, I think it is stupid too, but this "likeability" shit matters in politics. It's horrifying, but many Americans just vote for whoever they want to have a beer with... Which is one reason why our stupid nation deserves to be dethroned as a world leader.   Again, we see a double standard here with Warren. If Warren was a man, there'd be a lot fewer issues with the SNL appearance.
I like how even twitter cut that post off, as if to say ‚Äúoh my god, fucking please stop.‚Äù
Isn't she raising awareness just by going on SNL?  Doesn't that help the movement?  Can we please stop up-voting this controversy and stay focused on the goal of unification and collaboration?
And surely that original Tweeter has contributed legislatively to the progressive cause to speak with such authority.   Pfft. Liz has done more for the progressive cause than that Tweeter could fathom. Protip: snake emojis don't count as progressive policy.
I was watching the Hillary doc last night on Hulu and I think (whether you like Hillary or not) it really highlights how tough it is for a woman to really succeed and be well liked in politics. I think one quote that really got to me was ‚ÄúThink if a woman who is universally loved in politics and let‚Äôs try to emulate her‚Äù... and they couldn‚Äôt think of anyone. This was back in the 90s when Hillary was a feminist icon- she kept her job as a lawyer, she rallied for healthcare, and she spoke at the 4th UN women‚Äôs convention. And she was hated for it. It‚Äôs so hard when anything and everything you do as a woman in politics is scrutinized to such a high bar.
Did y‚Äôall see the replies to AOC‚Äôs tweet calling the flip the switch vid legendary? So many Berners going after her, it was so disappointing
Funny how it's her job to get him the nomination.   Maybe if it's her job to make sure someone gets the nomination just give it to the most qualified candidate instead? Nah, better make people vote for Sanders instead.
No one is demanding that Andrew Yang make an endorsement. Just saying.
It's never Bernie's fault. The fault is always due to a conspiracy or someone else.       Maybe if Bernie and his supporters would man up and actually he constructive and productive, people would actually be receptive to his message. But he doesn't and he won't.
Bernie fucked up, period.  His downfall is his unwillingness to discipline his own campaign. It's like a parent who allows his child to do **whatever** the kid wants but then refuses to accept any responsibility when the child starts hurting people.  Don't be too surprised when people refuse to talk to you after your kid becomes the biggest bully around the block.
It never even occurs to people that appearing on SNL lends credibility to your platform.
This kind of criticism reminds me of how sports fans will hate on a player on their own team for posting a picture of them doing something fun in the offseason. The comments are always ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt you in the gym?‚Äù The subtext being that they‚Äôre not allowed their own life ever even if the athletes ARE in the gym a lot and just took some downtime.
A woman's only purpose is to show unflinching loyalty to a man, don't ya know?  Even when that man threw her under the bus and did nothing why his surrogates and supporters ripped her to shreds like starving dogs.  You reap what you sow.
Lmao it‚Äôs Bernie‚Äôs job to get Bernie the nomination. It‚Äôs not Elizabeth‚Äôs job.   But anyway I‚Äôm sure she will do what she thinks is right and the best approach to try to accomplish her agenda.
Bernie literally squandered all of his post Iowa/NH/Nevada momentum on not acting like a front runner, unforced errors like praising Castro, skipping Selma to go to a rally for himself in LA and doubling down on his divisive ‚Äúme vs the establishment‚Äù rhetoric. No attempts to unify or do anything besides be an underdog fighting an uphill battle.   Also not making stronger inroads with the black community who obviously don‚Äôt trust him. Too much focus on rallies to hear applause for himself from his base and not enough on expanding it or building coalitions and unity.   It was Bernie‚Äôs nomination to lose and he‚Äôs doing just that.
He's using the same tactics from '16 and you see what happened then...
The only thing Warren is allowed to say now is that she endorses Bernie Sanders, and that he is the second coming of Christ.   Anything else she says, or every breath she exhales that DOES NOT include an endorsement of Bernie Sanders is just proof that she was not just a neo-lib, but actually a conservative republican trumpeter all along. How dare she.   Ugh so ridiculous. and I am SO over it.
I had to unfollow Ashley after that tweet. It‚Äôs like, seriously? She has to be working 24/7 every day for the rest of the election? Get out of here with that.
Hot take but if this is the kind of dialog that Twitter is driving, it‚Äôs making us all dumber and less able to have a real conversation.
Good Lord, some people need to calm down, her appearance on SNL is funny and she doesn't have to be spending 24/7 campaigning now that she has dropped out. Plus she should take a little bit of time to decompress from what she has done while deciding what her next move will be.
That is pure twitter stupidity. I hate the trend of social media as news source. Get a paper!
I am getting the feeling Warren Dems need to break away from Bernie‚Äôs progressives and build a coalition of cooler heads, cooler rhetoric, and an openness to working with folks who haven‚Äôt been persuaded by our policy ideas yet.   Stanning for Bernie shouldn‚Äôt be a requirement to be a progressive.
Bernard stans be treating their likeliest allies -- Warren, Pete, Kamala -- even worse than their biggest so-called enemies.
I've seen a lot of this on twitter, but they either won't or can't acknowledge that even with her endorsement the numbers aren't there. She can't put him over the top even if she brought us all on board (which wouldn't happen; 46% of her supporters have gone to Biden).  They're lashing out at Warren because they see another of his campaigns crashing and they refuse to blame Bernie and the mistakes he's made in his campaign. When Bernie drops out they'll blame her completely, I have no doubt of this. I've seen enough venom on twitter lately that I know it's coming.
Sanders supporters acting like this only makes me more glad I decided to go with Biden.  Edit: I was personally PMed by a Sanders supporter for this post. He called me a clown for being a gay Biden supporter. Let me just say, I understand that voting records change as people grow. I like that Biden grew and continues to grow as a person. Also, PMing me with an insult makes me not only want to not vote for Sanders, but to actively dislike his supporters.
THIS PERSON trying to tell E WARREN about doing the bare minimum for progressive causes?! Wild.
Some of Bernie's supporters are just pure toxic. The same people who berated our beloved Senator are still the same asshats who tweeting stuff like this and asking for support. Liz should just choose Biden and put a nail in these people.
I don't regret shifting my support from Warren to Biden whatsoever.
How about we just stop making him her responsibility at all?! I‚Äôm done with it. She is not responsible for making sure he wins.
They're already trying to force the narrative that when Bernie loses the primary it's because Warren didn't support him.
People are just mad because they know warren is the better dancer, debater, leader, and would have made a better president and all of these reasons are why she hasn't endorsed Bernie.
That take coming from a fucking bernie supporter makes me want to rip my fucking eyes out.
If Bernie loses I want all his viscous, back biting supporters to have a good long talk with the person im the mirror about what they could have done differently to expand their coalition.
If withholding a Bernie endorsement means she gets Treasury under Biden then it is 110% worth it.
Only real leftists cry about Warren on SNL
Holy cow people are so goddamn dumb.  This just made me irrationally angry.  Or maybe rationally.  Unsure.
If only there was a way to slap someone in the face over Twitter for saying something so dumb and awful.
I took a look at that Ashley Ray's timeline.  She seems like someone who has one goal: stir up shit and get people angry.  "Hot Takes" as it were.
Strong coalition building there shitting on the one candidate and group of supporters that should be an easy easy get.
You know things are rough when Bernie fans are attacking AOC for liking the Warren dance
I see Bernie camp working hard to gain those Liz votes....
Tulsi Gabbard is splitting the progressive vote!
Making it real hard not to vote Biden just to spite the Bernie or Bust folks. Even though many of them didn't bite the bullet and vote Hillary in 2016, I'm willing to vote Bernie tomorrow and this fall. But man, they make it hard.
She‚Äôs definitely allowed to have fun. Do you think she shouldn‚Äôt endorse him?
This is the problem with extreme populism and demagoguery. You may like the positions, but the followers often treat things like life or death
I could barely understand that sentence.
I've seen people losing their minds over this and I can't take it.
Please stop letting random internet posts divide us. Those of us who support the ideas of both Warren and Sanders have SO much in common. I‚Äôd have happily voted for Warren in November, but now it‚Äôs between Sanders and Biden to win, and Sanders is definitely much closer to Warren than Biden will ever be. We‚Äôre on the same team.
I love when stuff like that lands on my timeline because it just shows me which accounts to mute and ignore. I‚Äôve got a lot so far!

The nerve!  https://mashable.com/video/bernie-sanders-impersonator-james-adomian-interview/
Ugh, screw people like ashley ray.  I watched the SNL skit.  Warren was funny, witty, willing to laugh at herself... it made me sad all over again, thinking what could have been.  I will still support her if she endorses another candidate or not.  I pray that she will run again in 2024, since both Biden and Sanders are likely one-term presidents.
[removed]
They never saw us as allies.
And THAT is it. I know I‚Äôm going to anger someone by saying this, but I hope she doesn‚Äôt endorse anyone. It is not her responsibility to get one of those men elected when she was the superior candidate in every way.
If Bernie loses it will be because some of his supporters are assholes and the rest won't teach them fucking manners.  I want a progressive candidate and some of his supporters make my blood boil.
WHEN Bernie loses, which is now virtually inevitable thanks to the way they handled the first half of this race, it will represent the biggest missed opportunity by progressives in a generation. And his base has nobody to blame but themselves. A buddy of mine had a friend say recently that Bernie was ENTITLED to our votes. He used that word ENTITLED.      ENTITLED.      None of you who are coming here to poach support are entitled to anything. Get over yourselves.
Moderates aren't pulled in by policy. If that were true, Hillary would have plowed over Trump in all the swing states.
Well...not quite like Warren could because unfortunately she couldn't. I want her as my president but she was not able to get a large enough coalition together
You can not blame anyone doing well or not on the others in the lane. I felt like this was one of the points that she was talking about in her exit. I am a male supporter of Bernie, I do not expect her to endorse. I also think her supporters will decide if they have not voted and they will support the candidate, probably Biden, that wins the nomination. Thinking that progressives must band together because they are progressive is just not how it works. For Senator Warren she has capital, she represents a valuable base to defeat Trump but still the minority in the Primaries. If she endorses Sanders then people say she caved to far left. If she goes for Biden she went too center. In fact she is going to endorse the person that will look at her plan and give her ideas weight in their administration. She is not surrendering, she is taking the victory she has, her movement and repositioning it. Sanders needs to earn her voters just as Biden does and just moving because she is done is not smart and she knows that and is doing the right thing,

...Bernie is still in the race
Too bad Warren couldn't pull minorities
He doesn't. He has some good policies but he's really shit at selling them (and himself as a candidate) to the moderate Democratic base.
Agree with everything you're saying and Maddow's interview with him last week really highlighted this. She was asking neutral, legitimate questions about going after clyburns endorsement and going after non white voters. Sanders responses were telling and not encouraging. He's not even attempting to unite moderates with him.
In short, they reap what they sow.  They wanted to treat every other candidate like the "enemy" and in doing so; they made enemies.

What's weird is being an active Sanders supporter both in 2016 and this primary, I've met with local supporters, here in what was pretty wide Bernie country in 2016 (WA), as well as communicated heavily with many supporters online.  A tiny, tiny fraction of those people, literally zero of real life supporters I've encountered, even all the yutes in college I've encountered, and only two of the many dozens online, and I mean actually talk in voice or video chat as verifiable humans who are who they say they are, have been the toxic type. Those two were Trump supporters otherwise, which is kind of the opposite way to go, but we all have the propensity to make mistakes.  Those on Reddit with accounts that are relatively new or only recently active again are the worst I've seen, as well as really hardcore Twitter and Facebook accounts that seem to almost only be hateful, toxic, gross people... and some that I have approached for further discussion refuse any communication besides text.  I saw the shape of things on S4P change in 2016 almost overnight, it was really weird, and I jumped out of that sub when suddenly broader, friendly discussion of the primary was barely allowed (no mod activity, but serious downvotes), and hostile talk was everywhere. I saw the same happen oddly with the Buttigieg sub at some points. The mods there didn't have as much to contend with, and they were on top of cleaning up a lot of it, but it happened similarly and really rubbed me the wrong way. The Biden and neoliberal subs as well.  My experience really makes me lean towards the possibility that large majority of "supporters" on social media aren't genuine supporters, maybe not even American. I don't know how true it is, but some reports indicate it's some widespread stuff... the nature of it though means I just can't really point a finger at anyone in particular and accuse "RUSSIA". So I'm not sure where that leaves things, I don't know how to convince others that maybe it's not as genuinely nasty as things appear on social media... but what do you even do about it if it's not genuine, and then of course what do you do if it is?  I'm at a loss on what to actually do, but I can at least say my experience has me believing that most American supporters of various candidates aren't actually so horrible.  Though of all the subs for major candidates, in my experience, Warren's has been the most friendly and balanced. Mods on top of shit, and just a lot of nice folk. I would have happily voted for her as the nominee.
To be fair, Warren has definitely given the Democratic establishment the middle finger a time or two (as they deserved)
This is true. There's no point in tossing away political capital if it's not going to achieve anything. Warren understands something that Bernie doesn't, you have to play ball with other people. You can't walk around screaming that other Democrats are evil and then suddenly be surprised when they treat you like the bad guy.
Yea giving the Democratic Party the middle finger everyday doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve seen Bernie crowds boo democrats more than Trump.   He fights the establishment like Dems are evil, then says we need to save Medicare and Social Security. Which party does he think passed those laws??  It was ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù that embraced Warren‚Äôs Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Maybe if his swarm of supporters weren‚Äôt busy calling Warren a snake, her base might have shifted to Bernie, but they‚Äôre too smart. Remember when Bernie trainee his volunteers to tell voters that Warren voters were elitist educated folks? How did that strategy go??
You're not a *true* progressive until everyone in Washington hates you.  Nevermind that you'll need some of those people to actually affect policy change, the more people in Washington that dislike you, the more progressive you are. Why cant Warren be as progressive as Bernie?

I don't necessarily think endorsing Sanders is a bad move politically because she has a lot of sway in the party, at least since she dropped out. I think it would be a genuine boost to his campaign because it would help assure people that he still has someone pragmatic in the administration helping make decisions. That said, I think there's also the case that her endorsing Biden in exchange for some cabinet post would benefit the progressive cause in the more likely case that he ends up winning.  If that option is even on the table, anyway.
"BeCaUsE PeOpLe aRe GoNnA dIe without medical care!"  Sorry, but people are already going to because I have no faith in a Sanders administration getting any of his talking points passed through.
They're already starting on AOC.
Trump went on SNL too in 2016. He was horrible but it definitely gave him likability points. And when Jimmy Fellon was touching his hair on late night...
I wish republicans would realize Trump doesn't drink alcohol. He wouldn't even sit down and drink a beer with you even if he liked you!
Many of Warren‚Äôs supporters are loyal to progressivism, but a lot of us just liked her. She was the most qualified and had the best approach.  I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as moderate, but Warren convinced me to go a little more left than I would‚Äôve otherwise.  Now that she‚Äôs out it‚Äôs not obvious for me who to get behind.
> Isn't she raising awareness just by going on SNL?   How does that help advance progressive policies? If Joe Biden gets the nomination, progressives will get no policies at all? Endorsing Sanders only takes a 30second tweet.  > Can we please stop up-voting this controversy and stay focused on the goal of unification and collaboration?  I agree. The time is to unite and to advance the progressive cause. That means stopping Biden.
The number of people who don't recall her work on health care is astounding.

Their entire attitude to her since the beginning is that she has be his sidekick or cheerleader and anything less is betrayal because he is progressivism incarnate.     She doesn't get to show any daylight or outshine him. She's fine as long as she knows her place.
Warren was surging and Bernie was dropping in the beginning. Bernie just had a heart attack. He could have easily seen the momentum shifting, drop out and throw his support to Warren, which would have completely changed the dynamics of the race. A surging Warren could have gotten quite a few Amy and Pete supporters on board and challenge Biden.   Instead, he has AOC endorse him, steal votes from Warren, then smear her while his attack dogs troll all her supporters, alienating the entire Democratic party in the process, then wonders why we won't support him now. Despicable.  I liked Bernie before this election. I was prepared to vote for him. But man, his true colors have really been revealed.
Happy cake day!   And I love that analogy. Papa Bernie needs to get his house in order. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson tweets Elizabeth Warren is ‚Äúa baller‚Äù
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.  Last I'd heard, Dwayne Johnson was a Republican. But, y'kno, one of those mild ones like Schwarzenegger where socially liberal but "I'm rich and I'd prefer to pay less taxes."
Good, he has been on fire lately with some pretty amazing movies and we need more than just the politically engaged to support Warren if we want to enact her policies.  Celebrities are key to bringing in the unengaged and the young.  I am really hoping Taylor Swift comes out for Warren hard.
This is obviously a reaction to her bit on The ~~Tonight~~ Late Show where she kept saying he was her favorite actor on Ballers.
Last night I was at a brewery and overheard someone from the other end of the bar asking a few their friends if they had seen the Warren video about gay marriage and the on-fire response she gave. They pulled it out and watched on the phone. The others laughed at her response and said "That was great! I like her." I think three more people were converted to supporters just then.
that's really interesting as i thought he was a conservative similar to arnie, and not just cause they are both beefcakes
Wow! Those twitter comments though. Why do the MAGAts fear celebrity endorsements (it wasn't) after they elected a fake celebrity game show host?
We‚Äôve been hearing buzz about Liz‚Äôs VP being Castro or Gillum, but my bets are on The Rock.
Yeah but I think-   # IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU THINK
Dave Bautista supports Sanders. This is all a work for the next Wrestlemania.
I love how enthusiastic The Rock is about Liz. It‚Äôs great ‚ô•Ô∏è

He said a year or two ago that he was considering a run for President (in 2024 at the earliest), and although he used to be a registered republican, he‚Äôs now an independent.
Trump is making everyone rethink being a Republican.
Conservatives: ‚ÄúThe Hollywood elite need to keep their mouths shut and out of politics!‚Äù  Also conservatives: *elect an actor and a reality tv show host*
I think he tweeted this just because he saw what she said about Ballers in the Just One Question segment of Colbert this week.
If Taylor Swift comes out for Warren I will spontaneously combust
And to the fact that she continually makes baller moves on the campaign trail. Mic drop moments like marry one woman, if you can find her, the other night, flattening opponents left and right on the debate stage - most memorably John Delaney. If the label fits, wear it, and it fits.
Late Show*  https://youtu.be/hoifsMHWPOQ?t=3m24s
I can totally picture this! What a happy image.
I am actually a Conservative. We don't exactly have a home in either the Democratic or Republican parties anymore.  But Republicans enact policy's without Pay-for's and Democrats always come ready with an idea of how they will pay for their policies. So, in reality, Democrats are better at being Fiscally Conservative than Republicans.   The only way a Conservative would feel at home in the Republican party is if they are against Equal Rights for minorities. Which is a dying belief.
Anyway, Arnie is only conservative lite. When things like social issues or election security issues come into play, he's an outspoken liberal.
He‚Äôs not white, and that tends to correlate with one‚Äôs political views.
It‚Äôs all one way streets with them. They don‚Äôt give two craps about extramarital affairs, criminal behavior, lying under oath, celebrity endorsements, any of it. They only care about winning and power and control and massage of their fragile egos. Trump is their apotheosis. Anything that works to keep their team in power or get them into power, they‚Äôre for it. Rah rah ree, kick ‚Äòem in the knee, rah rah rass, kick ‚Äòem in the other knee. They are similar to sports fans who cheer when an opposing player is gravely injured. Deplorable, Hillary had it right and should‚Äôve doubled down on that comment in the first place.
Yeah those comments are cancer in written form.
Remember last election when Hulk Hogan said he wanted to be Trump‚Äôs VP pick? That would‚Äôve been the most ‚ÄòMerica thing to happen in the history of ‚ÄòMerica.
I‚Äôm a die hard Warren fan, but if Liz Warren picks The Rock as her VP everything I know about her is a lie.  She would only get my vote against Trump because of who Trump is but she‚Äôll get zero financial support and I‚Äôm not going to volunteer for her anymore  I‚Äôm very confident she won‚Äôt.
*barf*
Do you smell...what The Rock...is cookin‚Äô?
More like, "I support the progressive candidate with the highest chance of actually passing progressive legislation".
"Reality TV".    I like to use quotes, because there is not a single thing real about it.
Also Conservatives:  *Here's Clint Eastwood, dementia edition, to ramble on about a Chair at the RNC and why Barrack sucks! Please clap!*
Not to mention they die of excitement when they find out a celebrity is a republican
"Also Kanye has some really insightful things to say."
That's ok. Support is support even if casual.
She is definitely coming out for the Democratic nominee. She has mentioned she stayed quite in 2016 as she was worried she would do more harm than good, then Trump won. Now she is going to be more outspoken in 2020.  The question is if she comes out for Warren in the primary or in the general.
"Joe Donnelly"
Amen.
Thanks to people like you. I wish we had a real conservative party for liberals to have to convince. It helps the best policies get enacted!
I know that there have been a lot of issues with Republicans for some time, but recently it's gotten so much worse and I feel bad for reasonable conservatives that have been put in a catch 22. A lot of people have been just left out.

And he's very pro-immigration.
Well he‚Äôs also rich which also does
except for all the catholic Mexicans and Philipinos who are conservative
Cue ‚ÄúI am a real american‚Äù
Almost literally right out of Idiocracy too!
So a racist VP with a racist President.
I think you can be confident in your confidence.
That‚Äôs absurd. You should donate and volunteer to whoever the nominee is, because that will be better than Trump. We need to be willing to put our preferences aside, if it comes to that, and work as hard as we can to elect someone who isn‚Äôt Trump in 2020.  Any candidate with a D after their name should get the same amount of material support. If you‚Äôre able to give to Warren, you‚Äôre able to give to the Rock.
To be honest, that wasn't Reality TV with or without scare quotes. It was a game show. And frankly, calling him a game show host feels even more damning than reality tv show host.
I don't think she'll come out for anyone in the primary. She's said that she's pretty much #BlueNoMatterWho and Democrats need to stop with the infighting. I'm sure she'll be very supportive in the general, though.
Oops - fixed it, thanks.
I consider my self a conservative because I believe in slow, carful, continual, progress.   Pay for your plans. Prove your plans are worth the cost, and revert back if the outcomes wind up not being worth it. When in doubt, wait for more data.   The reason I am advocating for the largest progressive is twofold.   One, we have been doing so little progress for so long, we have a GIANT list of really good ideas that have tons of data backing up that they are worth trying. We should have been trying them out, one at a time, for the last 50+ years. But since we have been in gridlock for so long, we have to cat h back up.  Two, Warren is specifically hunting for improved outcomes, not pushing her specific ideology. If something works, she is for it. If it is shown not to work, she will stop advocating for it. This *SHOULD* be every candidate, but it seems pretty rare these days.   I am for Warren to catch us back up. And after the Republicans have defended Trump this through all of this, it is unlikely I'll vote Republican again.
I wish that was a less accurate take...
Yes. Like I said, ‚ÄòMerica.
I'm concerned The Notorious RBG is going to die within the next 4 years. She needs to be replaced with someone much younger.  And who knows, maybe Kavanaugh will slip on a banana peel.
The US government isn‚Äôt a fucking joke.  The rock has identical political experience to Trump and we have no clue of his values.  Elizabeth Warren is old.  Her VP might need to take the reigns.  The rock could be worse than Trump, we have no idea.  Additionally if Warren chooses the rock than everything she‚Äôs saying now is an outright lie.
 Warren/Trebeck 2020  :)
Oh yeah definitely! Every now and then she'll post letters she writes to politicians. Definitely she'll get younger Americans to care more about who's in government.
I assumed it was on purpose
This is how I used to imagine politics works. We had the progressives pushing us towards, well, progress, and conservatives saying, "hold up, let's make sure this idea is feasible." I thought there was an important give or take that let our society progress in meaningful ways.       Unfortunately I've come to understand conservative actually means "conserving as much money for the rich as possible."       I hope you get to continue and grow your idea of conservatism, I truly do.
Trump is certainly no avatar of conservatism. He is a paragon of destruction, chaos, dishonesty and a whole host of other ills.
>One, we have been doing so little progress for so long, we have a GIANT list of really good ideas that have tons of data backing up that they are worth trying.   I'm curious, being that you're a conservative, what is on this list for you? It may differ from mine but my big three are:  Medicare for All  End Perpetual War (give the state department more funds for diplomatic missions, encourage relationships and negotiations, and other tools at our disposal like economic sanction etc)  Education (I'm not specifically talking eliminate college debt but everything in our education system needs a hard looking at, from teacher salaries, standardized testing to funding semi-public universities)
I like you.
> And who knows, maybe Kavanaugh will slip on a banana peel.  Into a gorilla cage.
I agree with this sentiment. No political neophytes should be running for POTUS or VP.
Yeah, I could‚Äôve pretended and gotten away with it. Reinforces the joke that the candidate is not exactly memorable, chuckle.
Their idea of conservatism IS conservatism;  the modern GOP is regressive, not conservative.   Conservatism is a slow march, carefully, towards progress.  Regressivism is a hard push BACK to a prior state or time- regression- without regard for continued progress or with active disdain for such.
>a secret Democrat who donated to Clinton  -Fox News, 2021
There are quite a lot of things. M4A because what we are currently doing does NOT work. Dozen little things for education as they tend to be revenue positive.  But the biggest thing is actually Climate Change, because we are out of time to not work on it. But before any of the programs or strategies we can use to fight climate change will ever stick, we have to do something about corruption. We can't have another 4-8 years of gradual progress on Climate change and then 4 years of a Republican undoing it.   I can't think of anything more conservative than trying to keep our planet habitable for people to live on.
\*a fellow gorilla's cage
> But the biggest thing is actually Climate Change, because we are out of time to not work on it.  Exactly this. This should be a bipartisan issue. But my parents got a survey from the RNC lamenting the "Democrat's costly fixation" on climate change.
Wow. How did I miss climate change. I'm a vegetarian for climate change reasons. Very thoughtful. Also, reading some more of your comments, it seems like overturning citizens united would be the best actionable item we can do to start the change on a lot of these issues.
The only reason it is NOT bipartisan is because of lobbyists and corporate interests who have found that if they turn it into a partisan issue, they can get what they want more than half the time.  They pay Republicans to say it does not exist, and feed the voters misinformation and fear to get them to vote Republican. This turns into a viscous cycle.   If we take those tools away, we will see WAY more bipartisan effort, or way less pushback from republicans at the very least. I don't think there is actually a faster way to get where we need to go on the subject of climate change.
I hear ya. I was fairly typical eating meat about every day, but have since reduced it to less than once a week for climate reasons.  Sadly, I am now driving a TON and there is not much that can be done to avoid that. So I am not a paragon of low carbon, just trying to reduce that which is inside my control.  At some point, we will have to do a Carbon Tax to correct the market imbalances. But that one is going to be so unpopular that I think we need to work on equally important, but more palatable things first.   The list is so damn long. But the only way to get through it is piece by piece. As luck will have it, we have the rest of human civilization to work all this stuff out (I would like that to be a very long time).
Agreed. Rooting out corruption is key to climate action progress.
I always subscribe to the "do the best you can" mentality. It's easier to get the population to cut their meat consumption in half than it is to get half the population to go vegetarian.

Between this and her burn on John Delaney, this woman is on FIRE
She just keeps getting better at this. So proud to be Team Warren!
I‚Äôve been convincing my mom in Minnesota (I‚Äôm in California) to get in the warren train. This had her going, it really made me believe Warren can bring so many people together! Such a solid response and dig at the same time.
She had a plan for that.
So feisty, yet also wholesome. A great combination.
Elizabeth saw through that strawman argument and decided to light the strawman on fire instead.
oh wow. DT won't debate her, I'm calling it now. I so want it to happen but he'll be too scared (and rightfully so).    I still have a hard time believing she's 70. I want to be as sharp and witty as her when I'm 55, let alone 70.

We are actively watching the next president woo the nation. Elizabeth Warren started her grassroots movement 3 quarters ago and she is ON FIRE the longer she is out there stomping the yard. That‚Äôs OUR next president, folks!
Amazing response.
Anyone have the full link to the townhall?
Dayum.
Dude got straight, dealt.  Love it.
I believe this is the moment we say: "SLAAAAYYY KWEEEENNN"
I am all in on Warren.  I was waffling with her and Pete, but she is the clear choice here.
Damn. That was awesome.
Damn!
I am obsessed with this woman.
Sending more money. I'll sell my wedding ring.
The one thing I don't love about this is that a lot of people (including me, at first) are assuming the questioner was a conservative and thus Warren EVISCERATED him personally with her answer. But really he's a chair of the Human Rights Campaign and actually gay himself, so any "murder" here was purely hypothetical. ([He seems to be taking it in stride, though.](https://mobile.twitter.com/morganwcox3/status/1182474538849693697))
***BAH GAWD THAT MAN HAS A FAMILY***

Madame ~~President~~ Savage
I'm a Baptist, and I do believe that marriage is between one man and one woman, and I agree here. I don't think it's the government's job to try to make everyone act like good little Baptists.  1. They won't be able to do it, anyway.  1. It will distract from other problems that government is better suited to handle. 1. Obeying God's law because the government forces you to does nobody any spiritual good anyway.  But I also don't think that legal marriage and religious marriage need to be the same thing at all. If the government required legal marriage to be done by a civil official and have no religious trappings (as in some European countries), I'd have done that but also done a religious ceremony.
That's my president!
Holy shit I love it! Bring the heat!
That's how you answer that question
I'm starting to understand why no one picks a fight with her during the debate.  They are all expecting to be grilled like that.
That Slay-nator from Massachusetts Eli-slay-beth Warren.  She slayyyyyyed.
This is not quite on the same level as "basket of deplorables," but it's in the same vein. It risks activating her opposition, and doesn't improve her appeal to her target audience.
At work and can't watch the clip, can i get a tl;dw?
Careful, Fox News may run with this post title. "Sources are reporting...video currently unavailable."
Kelso_burn.gif
still no full video of her townhall?
I fucking love this, but it‚Äôs 100% a ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù or ‚Äúclutch to their guns and Bibles‚Äù line. The follow up line being, ‚ÄúNo one is forcing their religious beliefs on you anymore than you‚Äôre allowed to force yours on them,‚Äù would drive the point home without creating enemies and resentment.
I still like Warren but this didn't impress me. Really reminds me of Kamala's "tiny little man" comment during the last debate. Zingers aimed to prompt OOH ROASTED XD XD and get the soundbite on social media. I expect better.
What a dumb headline.  Be better /r/ElizabethWarren.  This is how some voters will come to know her.
She definitely has a natural ability for comedy. Waiting out the laugh, give a shrug, knock em dead, and walk away.
Right?!?  If it was me I just know I would have slipped and started saying the punch line a bit too early while people were still clapping.  She waited it out for the perfect amount of time and just nailed it.
She was also hilarious on Colbert, I was surprised how funny her and Bernie were, politicians usually suck when they try to be funny, specially when someone else writes the material (Kamala bombed a couple of times in similar fashion) but her and Bernie legitimately made me laugh.
I'm genuinely shocked by that as well.
Obama was pretty funny too.
Being a law professor is helpful for that, yeah?
That timing was so awesome.  Great, humorous answer; and then next level shade to follow it up.  Smart AND funny!
99% of stand up is rehearsed.  https://twitter.com/queeninyeiiow/status/1183034680855203841?s=21
They don't care about sexism. They're just grasping for any criticism that will stick. Fortunately none are sticking.
The Venn diagram of those were 100% OK with Trump's Hollywood Access tape and those that take offense of Warren's rhetoric here ... is a circle.
My guess is, that people look so hard to find something, that they go after the "I'm gonna assume it's a guy who said that.". Boom, sexism alarm.
Who is saying it‚Äôs sexist?
Especially if it's a Trump supporter criticizing her. Like can you imagine the mental gymnastics someone who supports a sexist, racist, homophobic asshole like Trump has to go through to think that Warren is the sexist one?
Because...this may be a surprise...there are women who believe marriage should be between a man and a woman.  I mean, I get it, probably 90% of those who bring up that old line about a "traditional" marriage are patriarchal men but she left out that women can be bigoted, too.  That's my only guess?
I like her even more after that and I happen to be a straight dude. And the right has the nerve to say we're the snowflakes, lol.
Tribalism. It can form around anything. My thing good means all other things competing are bad. The behavior fosters the 'sports team' mentality. We need to remember what we stand *for* not *only* what we oppose. Opposition alone is not an ideology.
I don't know about sexist, but considering the question was framed as coming from an existing supporter I doesn't make sense to mock and alienate them.   Considering Warren was a Republican until she was 47, you'd think she of all people would understand that people can change their political stance if presented with the right information.   Sarcasm and mockery don't do much to convince people, especially those that already support you, that your perspectives align with their values.
A right wing commentators spun it as anti Christian . No idea how that works

That‚Äôs how you show conservative Christians it‚Äôs ok to vote for a Democrat, right there (Not to mention point out their hypocrisy). Beautifully done!
Good lord she is going to obliterate Trump in the debates. It's hard to imagine that wasn't rehearsed but even if it was she's got quite the stage presence.
Thank you dctrbob.
Obligatory RIP John Delaney
They need to stop giving her those lapel mics so she has something to drop every time she throws one of these zingers.

I forget what the Delaney burn was?
Have her watch the whole thing guarantee she'll like her more https://www.facebook.com/ElizabethWarren/videos/2434249386643284/
at 29, I'm probably at my lifetime peak of sharpness and wit and I guarantee even though we're about even now give it 10 years and I won't even be close to her at 70  raw intelligence she's probably a good 30 points higher but I feel about evenly matched with sharpness and wit
Assuming he is still around, he probably wont. I'm willing to bet he will just work to de-legitimize the whole democratic process & claim the DNC is just propping her up and stealing the candidacy away from Joe. And that's after Trump worked so hard to make sure Joe was clean enough to run. Reality distortion field 2020!
Mine too buddy!
this is the only acceptable context in which yasss kweeen can be used tbh
Can‚Äôt wait for her to do great things! With her Native background, she will be in touch with all things America! Go Warren!
This! I have CNN's app and the only thing they have is the marriage clip, and not even the full one. CNN really sucks at video distribution.
Hey just here to say your username is incredible, lol.
Well, he was asking more of a hypothetical.
That is similar to me
Why did you assume the questioner was a conservative? He phrased his question as a hypothetical.
The only way that happens is by you not understanding what's going on in the clip, I think it's pretty clear.
Well, once he finds a woman he will, anyway.
If you're talking about the [actual questioner](https://mobile.twitter.com/morganwcox3/status/1178683889738489858) and not the "hypothetical questioner," he's pro-gay marriage, works for the Human Rights Campaign and is gay himself, so one assumes he agrees with her.
If straight people were good at marriage, they might have an argument.
I think it's too late for the US to distinguish "types" of marriage at this point. The word/construct is so intertwined in our social structure that you couldn't try to rename either legal or religious marriage without inciting a ton of protest.   Plus, I fear that distinguishing them opens new doors for religious-justified discrimination. It's hard enough for married gay couples to adopt, so if you gave agencies the wiggle room to say, "Oh we only accept *religiously* married couples and you can't be since you're gay, sorry!"
Given the overwhelming response to it, including people in this thread that say it has or is tipping them toward her, I'd say the latter is demonstrably untrue.
Not a perfect quote:  > Question: What would you say to a constituent who said "My faith has me strongly convinced that marriage is between one man and one woman"?   > Answer: I'm going to assume it's a man saying this. And I would tell him "Okay, then just marry one woman."  > *Audience applause*  > "... if you can find one."  > *Audience goes wild*

Did you listen to the rest of it and the follow-up question? Stfu. She gave an honest answer, a zinger, then talked about how the faith she was raised in taught her that ALL people, regardless of orientation, are loved in God‚Äôs eyes.
Elizabeth Warren: "We must call out those who remain silent. We must initiate impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable. And we must build an unstoppable grassroots movement that resoundingly defeats not just Trump, but complicit Republicans everywhere."
I‚Äôve really been liking this quote lately:  ‚ÄúWe must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.‚Äù  -Elie Wiesel
She gets it. These are people that need to be defeated, not won over.
I very much agree with this.  And even though the impeachment vote failed yesterday, the fact is that more democrats voted for impeachment this time, then the last time the impeachment resolution was attempted.
I sent a strong letter to my house rep, and signed up for Justice Democrats to try and find someone to primary him. Done with weak democrats.
it's tiring trying to hold people accountable. THANK YOU EWARREN.
She is so right, the focus cannot solely rest on Trump.  Trump might be the mouthpiece, but there are numerous republicans (and some democrats) who continually make excuses, equivocate, or otherwise provide cover for his hateful antics.  We might be horrified by what he says and does, but he has really effectively exposed the racist underbelly in this country & brought it out into the harsh light of day.  I get so frustrated sometimes with what‚Äôs happening, but Elizabeth Warren has demonstrated how to frame the conversation so I try to keep the focus on the values that should be important to all of us, rather than partisan hackery.
Is Liz the first candidate to call the republicans complicit?
This is a great list of all of the turncoat Democrats that are aiding and abetting Trump:  [https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/democrats-voted-against-trump-impeachment-resolution/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/democrats-voted-against-trump-impeachment-resolution/index.html)  Interestingly, this list also lines up with those who voted to fund his concentration camps  E: Source  [https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h429](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/116-2019/h429)
It‚Äôs isn‚Äôt just complicity anymore.  It‚Äôs collaboration.
I'm torn about this. It's good that Warren publicly demands impeachment. The train needs to start rolling. But I can also see why Pelosi isn't on board right now.  No matter when or how the impeachment process starts, it will end the same. It will die in the Senate. Trump will not be impeached. That's a given. The goal of impeachment hearings needs to be to publicly expose as much evidence as possible and to put the Trump administration under pressure. And it all needs to be tied to the 2020 election. That's why it doesn't seem wise to start this year. The various House committees are already doing a great job. Let them finish and then have their various investigations culminate in an impeachment investigation. Wait with the impeachment until next year. That's when the elections will be.  The problem is, of course, that a huge number of Democrats and Progressives are growing impatient. They voted for impeachment in 2018. They're miffed that it hasn't started already. That's completely understandable. It's not helpful, however. I've tried many times to talk to these people but all I get is anger and downvotes. Sure, quite a few of them are concern trolls but I'm pretty sure most are not. The anger and disappointment are real. And I get it. I really do.
But but but, she once said she was native American, and she found out she's not! *clutches pearls* OMG!!! THE HORROR!!  AHHH!!   SOCIALISM!!!!   BUTTERY MALES!!!!
NOW we're talking. This exactly.  &#x200B;  But throw Pelosi in there with them. This idea of not doing anything because it's political suicide ought to be instantly impeachable, and remove the ones who fancy their careers over the job of representing the people.   &#x200B;  That's entirely the problem - they make promises and get elected, then treat the voters like common criminals, ignore them, mock them, dismiss them and do whatever the fuck they want to do, thinking of and serving only themselves now that they're "in". They don't seem to understand they're going to get away with this only so long before it sparks a full blown violent and bloody revolution when they have targets on their backs...and get exactly what they have coming.  &#x200B;  They need to do their jobs. Both sides. That job is upholding the Constitution and representing THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. NOT their jobs.

That is it on a motherfucking stick. We MUST be intolerant to intolerance and tolerant of everything else. You irrationally don't like immigrants and minorities? Fine, fuck off then, get out, you get nothing this society has to offer then, you don't get to be part of it.
You know what? I‚Äôve been raging about this since last night and your post really helped me calm down.  Maybe this is progress
Impeachment proceedings should begin (and really, they should have begun in the weeks after the Mueller report), but actually voting for impeachment before serious hearings is dumb, and will look crazy to people not already in the choir.   Impeachment will never result in Trump being removed from office, so the entire point is to A.)  convince people who aren't paying that much attention that Trump should be impeached, and then B. )f orcing Republican congressmen to go on record against impeachment, pissing off the potential voters you convinced in A), and C.) Don't enable bad precedents.  &#x200B;  I'm not overly happy with how Democratic leadership is managing messaging re: the various threats Trump and his enablers pose to the republic,  but jumping straight to impeachment a week before the Mueller hearing-without thoroughly describing  ‚Äútreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors‚Äù  does not make sense, and neither does  threatening to primary congresspeople for voting it down.
My rep, a supposed Democrat, voted against impeachment last night. I expressed my intense rage and utter contempt over the phone this morning. She has lost my vote in the primary.
Trump is a symptom not the disease. Look at Lindsay Graham, he's obviously gay and will support Trump forever.
Guys don't villainize fellow Dems for voting on that immigration bill.   Yes, it was a fucking shit bill, but there are REAL people drinking out of toilet bowls and being treated like filth in those detention centers. We don't have the luxury to pnly vote for perfect bills rn! Wtf do you tell the families of those people in the centers if they ask why you didn't vote to give any more funding to help their conditions??  If you want action, in terms of helping those in the camps rn, then you need to look for opportunities to give the least you can to the R's while (hopefully) sending some real relief.   Don't demonize fellow dems for that. This is an urgent situation. Desperate times, desperate measures.  Any other issue is a different story, but we have a historical humanitarian crisis on our hands. You shouldn't blame Pelosi for wanting to get something REAL done for the dentention people OR the Squad for wanting a better deal, one that *ensured* sone of the relief money passed would actually  go to the people.
Use this list to finance their opponents.
I get what you're saying about waiting until 2020 but I'm afraid Pelosi will never get there. She waited it out and failed to hold Bush accountable and her bullshit about "self-impeachment" seems to me like she won't ever want to impeach Trump as well.
Congress has a Constitutional duty to impeach. This isn't about politics, it isn't about optics, it isn't about 2020. This is about the Constitution, and the duty our elected officials have to uphold it.
[deleted]
100% disagree. Every day we wait. Children. Die. At the border. Stop enabling him.
No, this is bullshit. Many crimes and embarrassments have happened, they need to be held accountable. Sure it won't pass the Senate, but SO WHAT?? That just makes the Senate more publicly complicit in Trump's crimes.   People keep saying "oh but when impeachment fails it will raise his approval rating!" Maybe in the past, but not anymore. That way of thinking is dead. After the last 3 years it's apparent nothing will change his approval numbers. Nothing.
No one's said we'll never do it. Pelosi is known for being politically brilliant, and she despises Trump. The odds are she's waiting until the perfect timing during the election cycle next year to keep the whole thing fresh on voters' minds.

This one?  "There comes a time when silence is betrayal." "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter." "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."  -MLK
Part of the problem of silence is the fact that it's now politically incorrect to NOT give lunatics, psychopaths and fucktards a platform. Free speech is great but it doesn't automatically include giving unstable criminals a platform and a right to make the rules for anyone else.  &#x200B;  The trump supporters are insane and giving them a platform of influence is a problem. Religious delusion is a problem and giving them a platform of influence is a problem. They can say and believe whatever they want - but for our government to give them a shred of consideration as a "base" is a problem.  &#x200B;  Nobody who is sane is going to allow their tin foil hat wearing fundamentalist religious, hateful, corrupt uncle to decide what's best for the rest of the family...but we have stood silent while this shit became the norm for government.
If you put half the effort into researching this issue that you did writing this drivel you would know that the reason for money running out was not some influx of migrants, it was the exorbitant fees that DHS was paying private prison companies to run the concentration camps.  John Kelly is on the board of Core Civic, FYI.  You're eating the bullshit the right wing media is shoveling at you.   In 2018 the American people gave the House Majority to the Dems.  If they funds really were necessary, why did the Democrats vote on a clean version of the bill from the Republican Senate?  They could have gotten concessions.  They could have gotten protection for the children.  No bill passes the House without Dem approval.  Instead they gleefully funded Trump's concentration camps.
Nah, fuck em all. It costs $775 per person *per day* to house these people in dog kennels, all that's going on is grift and skimming.
> uys don't villainize fellow Dems for voting on that immigration bill.  I demonize all that contribute to the intolerant actions of our society. I have no political identity, and do not care about any political party or anyone's fucking political career. True, I'll never vote GOP ever again, but those who remain silent or vote for corrupt measure deserve to be thrown out. They've ruined lives, enabled the death of children under our name. I have no tolerance for that.
Bush was going to leave office either way, and in retrospect I doubt impeachment would've made enough marginal impact on results in 2008. That being said, I strongly disagree with Pelosi shutting the door on impeachment, especially after Mueller's public comments. She doesn't have to take overly calculated positions here; it's a simple matter of principle. If she doesn't have the votes to impeach, then she should whip them up.
I wouldn't bet against Pelosi. She's cunning.
Pelosi will never impeach any one, republican, Democrat, green, etc no matter what the crime or the evidence.   Pelsoi needs to resign.
EXACTLY. This is why NO VOTER should ever have a fucking political 'identity'. The constitution is all that matters, not some fucking political party or some ineffective weak speaker of the House.
McConnell will simply refuse to bring it to vote. Illegal, yes, but who's going to stop him?
Impeachment isn't going to stop that (the Senate won't convict), but not doing it sends a message to future presidents that nothing they do will ever rise to the level of impeachment.  Force those Senators to cast their votes saying this level of corruption and disrespect for the law is ok with them.
You didn't read his/her comment. He/she said that impeachment *needs* to happen. Just not right away. There's the real possibility that if you do impeachment proceedings too early then by the time the election rolls around the independents we need to vote D will have forgotten the laundry list of crimes and embarrassments Trump has done while in office, as well as the list of senators who voted no on impeachment.  Maybe you don't agree, but you should at least respect that Pelosi might have reservations about doing it too soon.  The **REAL** bullshit wpuld be if she never impeaches, but it makes top much sense to run the impeachment hearings closer to the election. The timing of doing so would be optimal, politically, and as long as they DO hold impeachment proceedings they will have done their duty to the Constitution, regardless of timing.
I hope you're right but every day he gets away with more and more. Even if it dies in the senate it needs to be done...
>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro‚Äôs great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen‚Äôs Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ‚Äúorder‚Äù than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ‚ÄúI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action‚Äù; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man‚Äôs freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ‚Äúmore convenient season.‚Äù  MLK
Wtf is wrong with you??   I'm not a right wing shill *FFS*.  I'm telling you that those Dem congress people are all trying their best to give those poor souls in the detention center *some* sort of help/relief. **They disagree on *how* to best help them, but all of them are voting for those people.**   There's no fucking cynical evil shit going  from the Dems on this issue of the detention centers.   Wtf are you smoking to assume otherwise???
What?? Fuck *who* all?
The fuck are you talking about?   All I was saying is when you're a **DEMOCRAT** in Congress rn, with this detention center crisis going on, you have limited options.  You pretty much either hold out for a perfect bill, while those poor people suffer in the centers OR you work as hard as you can to get the most you can out of a border bill and pass it in hopes that can relieve them in some way.   The whole "I won't contribute to the fascism/tyranny of this administration" thing is fine, but NOT on the detention center issue. Every second we spend holding out for a better bill for those people they're suffering.  Whether you believe/agree with my description of the situation in Congress  currently, you cannot hold it against the Dem congress people that voted yes on the border bill. **There's no cynicism about it, they were all doing what they thought was best for the victims in those detention centers.**
Pelosi's failure to impeach Bush shows a lack of principle on her part. Even though he was going to leave office either way, holding him accountable would still have sent a clear message. He wasn't ever held accountable though and it's horrible to see how his image has been rehabilitated since he left office.  I think her political calculation may be similar here: she figures Trump will probably leave anyway after 2020 so why impeach? It's the wrong approach.

>I wouldn't bet against Pelosi. She's cunning.  I'm going to need a source on this.  Other than taking in ~~bribes~~ donations for the DNC, I don't see her being effective at all
Bush, Cheney and Rumsfield should all be rotting together in a cell for the rest of their lives for war crimes. Obama should have been impeached for destroying the 4th amendment that eveyone likes to pretend never happened. Trump should go under the guillotine on the white house lawn. Then and ONLY then would we have a chance at true justice, peace and prosperity.
I don't think it's lack of principle, just that it's a poor reading of what happened after Clinton was impeached. Democrats did gain House seats in the aftermath of Clinton's acquittal, and Pelosi likely doesn't want to lose strong incumbents in swing districts. However, there are multiple ways to make the impeachment of Trump advantageous for Democrats, and I worry she's ignoring them too much for misguided reasons.
Elizabeth's portrait at Harvard Law is covered with "Thank You" notes
No doubt she‚Äôll continue to persist and fight for her policy one way or another. I'm excited to see what's next for Warren.
As an aspiring attorney, Liz has been such an inspiration to me. I hope she keeps up the fight and continues to inspire many more!
This is very cool; thank you (and I'm sad again...)
Oh wow, I hadn't seen the ones on Bruce's picture. Yeap, I'm gonna cry again today.
Too smart for even the Democratic electorate, sadly. That's the truth. Sure she made some campaign blunders, but ultimately, she lacked major drama.... And as we see with our current President, the people love drama.   She was just too boring for them, even if she was the best-packaged candidate.
I‚Äôm sure we will be thanking her for years to come. She is gonna continue to fight for those that have no voice. Better stock up on post it notes Harvard.
She didn't need your post it notes; she needed you to vote for her; she didn't need all the glowing news articles after she dropped out; she needed the positive press BEFORE she dropped out.  Now that she isn't seeking power, everyone loves her.
Awwww. My heart...
Always prouder (üòáüòâ) of the Warren team. Still standing and not afraid to face the tune üòª
She is amazing. This our loss as a country.
I‚Äôm a student at HLS and I got to write up my own thank-you notes to Senator Warren and Professor Mann on Friday. I‚Äôm still so sad about her campaign ending, and writing the notes felt like a little moment of healing. I‚Äôm glad so many of my classmates share the love and gratitude that I feel for Warren and her husband ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm seriously disappointed. While this is not as bad as when Hillary lost, I‚Äôm feeling similar feelings. As a teacher, I was supportive of Warren and her policies. She understood what it was like to be an educator, and I felt represented and understood. She is smart and capable, and she showed the courage to devour a billionaire‚Äôs soul on a national stage. She would have been an amazing president, and I‚Äôm sad she won‚Äôt get that chance.
Perhaps Biden will pick her as his running mate, if he gets the Dem nomination. Hopefully he‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs a way to heal the party and not alienate the progressive base, as Hillary did.
We're getting closer every day, and hopefully someday we'll actually get there.
<3 Thank you Liz! <3
Kind of cool they put a fire alarm next to her picture! üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

Senate Majority Leader by 2021.
Bruce would've made an exceptional First Gentleman.  Seeing a scholar and a supportive husband next to the leader of free world would do a lot to undo toxic masculinity in American culture.
I'm on the other side of the country, so her appearance on SNL gave me that moment of healing instead
I'm almost certain it's going to be Biden-Klobuchar. Female and Midwestern and her seat is safe with the party should she choose to leave the Senate.
I just hope I'm alive to see it.

Removed: Rule 4.

We'd need a progressive in the white house. Schumer is well liked by the democratic establishment.
I‚Äôve had that thought a lot over the last 6 months.  We need more models of supportive, devoted masculinity.
The way he protectively stood behind her while she was giving her concession speech just spoke volumes.  The way she mentions him, "Bruce drove me down to the town hall in Vermont," you can tell he's with her every step of the way.
No, Biden will pick Kamala Harris or another woman of color.  Perhaps Stacey Abrams.    He would be wise to pick Warren and make some concessions to his platform to appease progressives so that less of them will stay home or vote 3rd party, though.
Ugh. Having the opportunity to pick one of the two women who lasted until Super Tuesday, only one of whom represents a part of the party that feels ignored and unwanted, and picking Klobuchar...that would be absolutely peak Biden. I now feel that this is inevitable, because of course he would.
Ugh
If he‚Äôs going to choose a female midwestern VP I think Tammy Baldwin or Tammy Duckworth would be better choices.
It'll probably be a young(er) woman-of-color. Maybe Kamala Harris.
Do you plan on dying soon?
Please remember to stay civil. Many of us had different rankings after Warren, it is please try and respect that fact.
Schumer gets bullied by McConnell and cracks under pressure. Look how big he flubbed that Supreme Court ‚Äòthreat‚Äô and justice Roberts and McConnell made him look like an idiot.  If it isn‚Äôt Warren (who I would be thrilled if she got VP) then I hope someone else gets the leader position other than Schumer. Ducksworth, Feinstein, or Brown maybe??
I agree that it's going to be a woman, but I don't think he *has* to pick a woman of color though. Biden has a great rapport with the African-American community already, so it's not necessarily more advantageous than picking a white woman.  I would think the Biden admin will probably include AG Kamala Harris and NSA Director Pete Buttigieg though.
> He would be wise to pick Warren and make some concessions to his platform to appease progressives  I‚Äôve seen some people argue that Harris has an extremely progressive voting record.  Problem is, she‚Äôs ALSO got a [very problematic record](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/23/18184192/kamala-harris-president-campaign-criminal-justice-record) from her time as California‚Äôs Attorney General.  She‚Äôs not a dealbreaker if Biden puts her on the ticket in 2020, but if Biden steps aside in 2024, she‚Äôs going to have a really hard time making the case why she should get the nomination.
[removed]
I would love if Brown it Duckworth got it and I say that as a Feinstein constituent. I mean, obviously Liz too, but I see that as less likely unfortunately.
Buttigieg might be better as UN Ambassador or Secretary of State.  I feel like the VP would be someone the democratic party wants to groom for the 2024 run as Biden will only serve one term.  They will want it to be a woman and I still think that Kamala Harris fits the bill.  We will see if I end up correct.
Everyone has a problematic record, including Sanders (he spend the 90's tough on crime).  Harris got slandered like Warren did by the Sanders scorched earthers.  Harris actually wants to champion criminal justice reform.  She is not going to have a hard time, because she will have spend 4 years on criminal justice reform.  Good luck with the "Kamala is a cop" rhetoric after that.
If you would like to discuss a removal, please send a mod mail.
Cops are fine and important. Bad cops are absolutely terrible.
> She is not going to have a hard time, because she will have spend 4 years on criminal justice reform.   I look forward to seeing it.  FWIW:  I follow a number of prominent civil rights / criminal defense attorneys on other platforms (Twitter, etc).  They will WELCOME genuine reform.  They will also see through bullshit in a nanosecond, and waste no time calling her out, should she engage in faux-reform.
from a bernie bro...
I am voting, volunteering for and donating to whoever the nominee is. Ultimately, it sounds like a miscommunication, because Sanders does allow that he discussed gender and politics at this meeting. Seems pretty minor next to obstruction of justice, putting a hit out on a US ambassador, the eminent extinction of half the species on earth and "don't call them concentration" camps at the border.
Also the media needs to be front and center on trump parnas and impeachment.
We appreciate you. And believe me, for all the vitriol incited by randos, we also will fight like hell to make the nominee (whoever it is) the President.
I think it's important to remember that there's a concerted effort to divide the democratic base ahead of the general. Just saying.
This is exactly how I feel about Bernie. I'd still be extremely happy if he's our nominee. I think it's important to remember that the vitriolic comments that seem to be everywhere on the internet toward Warren represent a small number of people and isn't congruent with the real world. Hopefully the people saying these things can be swayed by the more reasonable people.
Thank you <3
Agree with this strongly but want to take it to another level and just say whoever the nominee is against Trump I will back strongly even if they are not a progressive. Removing him from office is priority number one.
Hear hear!
Thank you, same here. I think it is utterly ridiculous we are having this fight at all, let alone two/three weeks before Iowa
Fellow Bernie supporter here. I agree, and I just want to forget that this ever happened. We all need to stick together. This movement is so much bigger than the candidates themselves.  We need to defeat Trump. These are the only two who can do it, and we will only win by fighting, organizing and persisting **together**.
Thanks for being a positive representative for bernie oP
Yo, straight back at you as a Warren supporter. We in it together.
After I found out the person who organized the debate last night  Sarah Isgur Flores was apart of the Trump administration before she took a job a CNN. It really left me feeling like Liz and Bernard got played by CNN.  I'm most pissed at the fact CNN is considered news and just wants to divide the left bc we actually have a shot at this.  We are going to crush Trump and they will do everything in there power to stop us.
Dude, thanks for saying this.  I'm in the same boat - I'm thrilled with either Warren or Bernie.  Because they're both real progressives.  But note the amount of accounts in this thread trying to keep the "Bernie or Bust" kind of narrative going.  And then PLEASE remember that our federal intel agencies said that is **exactly** the technique the Russians used in 2016.  And they'll do it again.   [https://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/russians-used-bernie-bros-as-unwitting-agents-in-disinformation-campaign-senate-intel-witness/](https://www.rawstory.com/2017/03/russians-used-bernie-bros-as-unwitting-agents-in-disinformation-campaign-senate-intel-witness/)   Trump is in the White House.  A legit monster.  We need to vote for WHOMEVER can get him out of there... before it's too late.
Thank you! I get in more and more discussions with Bernie folk and them calling Warren centrist. I can't even deal it's an absurdity.
I‚Äôm voting for Warren if she‚Äôs the nominee and I‚Äôll vote for Bernie if he‚Äôs the nominee.  They‚Äôre easily the two best candidates of the field.
I'm a Bernie bro too. The way Warren supporters have been reacting to this on reddit has given me hope that progressives can stay united and move past this.
I love Bernie *and* Liz, I‚Äôd be happy to see either one of them take the nomination. I‚Äôm also sick of the in-fighting and bullshit, and the way the media is making something out of nothing. We can‚Äôt let anything divide us going forward!
This I can get behind. Pro-Bernie in 2016 now Im giving Liz a shot; at the end of the day I will go for either candidate. I wish the DNC would establish a ranked choice voting system so we could have the option to vote Bernie and/or Warren over Biden and vice versa. I think it would solidify the party more and be a great ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù to showcase ranked choice and how it represents constituents as a whole.
I‚Äôm a Bernie/Elizabeth supporter too! I‚Äôve resolved to vote for whomever has the delegate lead when it comes time for my state to vote. I love them both and I won‚Äôt let these smears distract me from the goal: get a progressive in the White House.
Despite all of this fighting when Third Way published an ugly editorial in today's WaPo claiming that Bernie is unelectable I defended him in the comment section. For the sake of what both sides care about we have to put this behind us.  By the way, it's the Biden supporters agreeing with the op-ed. We all should be focusing on keeping Biden from being the nominee and not this petty crap.
Maybe my standards are too low but I just want someone who is not Trump. If Warren or Sanders lied about one thing is fucking irrelevant in every way, the guy in office right now lies 300 times per day.
I‚Äôll vote for Biden if I have to. It would be stupid to not support any democrat against Trump. The risk is too high.
Phew I needed this today, glad to see this is such a popular post on here and the top comments are also positive. It's been a rough past week browsing these boards.
I‚Äôm supporting Sanders, but Warren has my vote in the general. I‚Äôd be happy with either/or.
Thanks! Blue no matter who, right?    Liz is my favorite, but Bernie would also be good.
It's just frustrating to always get shit from Bernie Bros about supporting Warren.
Thank you for being reasonable!
Bernie supporter here.  Same.  Warren has my full support if she wins the primary!
Same here. I actually don‚Äôt know who I‚Äôll vote for. Just whoever is leading by the time Georgia comes to vote. I just don‚Äôt want Biden, but will vote for him in the general if he gets the nomination
[deleted]
Bernie supporter here. I feel the same way. So bummed on this infighting. She has my vote of Bernie is out of contention. :'(
My only disappointment is that I believe Bernie did say it, and I wish we could address what I believe he meant and what it means.  I believe regardless of what Bernie's actual words were and how those words were relayed in a game if telephone thar Bernie had a legitimate concern.  There is still a portion of this country who can be persuaded by outright sexism. That Trump will do anything to win, and if that means exploiting that with the help of the Russians, Facebook, and plausible deniabilty then he will do so, and this fight...this time...might be best won if we did not introduce such reptile brain variables when 3 states and less than 100k votes get to determine our fate.  And I think the counterpoint to that is this fight is absolutely about who we are as a people, and getting those of us who aren't xenophobic Neanderthals to the voting booth.  Instead of a nuanced discussion about how a woman who had 3 million more votes than Trump is sitting at home and what it takes to ensure that doesn't happen again, it's turned into this media nonsense.
As a fellow Bernard bro (well, lady) YES
I'm also a Bernie supporter and completely agree. I also suspect that at least 15% of the folks this sub are Berners based on occasionally lurking.
Thank you. Back atcha!
Thanks for posting this. I feel the same way about Bernie. I‚Äôm worried that you might be in the minority of Bernie supporters though, at least from what‚Äôs visible online.   Does anyone know what the percentage of Bernie or Bust voters are in his camp?
This very post makes you not a Bernie bro, just an advocate for your preferred candidate :)
I like both and I've donated to both! I don't feel like Liz is a liar and I don't feel that Bernie would say a woman couldn't be president. Likely a miscommunication.
Anyone but Trump.
Bernie Bro is sexist as the term trivializes his majority female base
>even if she‚Äôs not Bernie lol  This reminded me of a pretty hilarious [McSweeney‚Äôs](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/this-candidate-seems-progressive-but-is-their-name-bernie-enough) article my wife shared with me.
Same here. I am just bored and the drama can be entertaining if you take it with a grain of salt.
The infighting is being drummed up by bots.  Why they seem to favor Bernie is beyond me, but Bernie needs to shut this shit down hard if he's to get my vote, assuming he's the nominee.
Same here, absolutely.  Thanks for posting this.
I'm sure Russia is behind the campaign to divide Bernie and Warren groups. Over night hashtags start trending, I see so many bots here and on twitter. It would be incredibly helpful if warren and Bernie put out a joint statement to help alleviate e division even if it's all BS optics
We will perssssssist together. üêç‚ù§Ô∏è
Bernie supporter here. Same.
Ditto that.  The trolls or legitimately angry Bernie bros out there will pass.  We know what happened in ‚Äò16 and aren‚Äôt looking for a repeat.  Just takes a while to figure out where to put the pitchforks when we‚Äôre all handed so many by the media. :/
I'm just sitting here wishing they were both on the same ticket.
I wish Mom and Dad would stop fighting...
Please don't call yourself a Bernie Bro. I know some on this sub likes to use it but I really wish they wouldn't and you don't have to play along with it. The Bernie Bro thing should have stayed in 2016.

Thanks. I feel the same way from the Warren side. I think he said it out of sadness, because our country is sexist and he was disappointed at the time. He can't explain that without the media taking it way way out of context. He is still on our team, but Warren also had to address it or it would damage her campaign. It's an unfortunate situation. Honestly though, so many people share his fears, including my female partner. It's good she finally got to address this issue and explain why she can win.
If Bernie did say this we don't need to argue about it we'll just prove him wrong!
I‚Äôve had more tense horrid arguments with family members and ultimately still love them, we forgive and get over it.   I‚Äôm of the mind that Bernie and Warren just don‚Äôt recall details or who said what in a forgettable moment to staff and here we are.   We are so quick in our society lately to burn people at the stake for the smallest little infraction and it‚Äôs infuriating. Remember what is at stake everyone; permanent GOP control of our government and a mob family in charge in perpetuity.
Agree from a warren supporter
[removed]
Agreed, She is still my #2 choice and I would Pick Warren over every other candidate. She is miles above the Rest of the Corp Dem trash and I would vote for her in a heartbeat. I want to feel in my heart that any True Warren supporter would be like me and hopefully every other Bernie supporter, that if Bernie or in the opposite case Warren does not make the nomination, we would come together and all jump over to support the remaining Progressive Candidate. I can and will gladly hop over to the Warren bandwagon if Bernie dropped out and I hope all Warren supporters would do the same. I cant imagine any Bernie OR Warren Supporter jumping on the Biden, Buttigieg OR (god forbid) The Trump Campaign.
what! I am a woman for Bernie and I feel the exact same way. Even Bernie said it: ''let's not focus too much on this because this is what Donald trump and the media wants us to do''
I think this issue is a huge negative for the progressive movement, and I don't know what Warren's team was thinking trying to make this an issue.  At best it's a distraction from real issues.  At worst, it looks like she took something from 13 months ago that's a complete "he said/she said" thing and made it an issue 4 days before the last debate before voting starts.  Nobody wants this bickering.  The online polls I've seen have mostly sided with "I don't care about this, this dispute is a distraction".  All it did was give America a view into bad behavior from both Warren and Sanders about a non-issue.  I wouldn't be surprised if both of their numbers go down over this unfortunately.
I don‚Äôt believe Bernie thinks women can‚Äôt win, I do believe Abby (CNN moderator) was incredibly unfair and biased, but it does not sit well with me that he does not at least acknowledge what Warren felt she heard. Warren is not the enemy. She is a progressive like Bernie and I expect a bit more empathy towards this situation. I‚Äôm having trouble letting this go.
simp
Most Bernie supporters share this sentiment, myself included. Unfortunately, people from both sides assume all the very vocal supporters on Reddit and Twitter are expressing the feelings of the majority. They are not. They are just the ones who feel the need to talk about it.
Maybe referring to a Sanders supporter insultingly as a Bernie Bro when they‚Äôre telling you they want to accomplish this together isn‚Äôt a good look?
How the fuck are you a Bernie bro? Fuck outta here
Maga 2020   Good luck u guys are fucked
I wasn't there, but I know in my heart the conversation went like this.   EW - We shouldn't split the progressive vote, Bernie, please support me.  BS - I like you but I have a better chance in the general, look what happened to Hillary.  And from that, you can see that really both sides are telling the truth.
Thank you,  I think a lot of this is bad faith actors trying to divide us, not sure how much of this on Twitter or Reddit is real.  One thing to add. This is a strategic mistake by Warren. This is a he said / she said and a real dumb hill to die on. It's a private conversation that should not be played out in public, and Warren permitting the MSM to make an issue out of this is a distraction and playing into MSM manipulation. There is literally no way Bernie or Warren can win this battle, so it should not be fought.   The best thing she can do, is to kill this issue and story. Bernie has even demonstrated how to do it last election with his "no one cares about your damn emails" statement.   Our enemy is the corporate status quo. Not each other. I for one will not be manipulated into this BS.
When I'm canvassing I tell bernie folks I would be happy if Liz and Bernie could split Cali 50/50 and cut out all the other candidates.
I mean this stuff is really bad and it's ok to be mad at each other's candidate.... It's natural but let's not be mad at each other.  That's how they make us lose.  Bernie supporter.

Warren finds the best solution with the tools available. She is a problem solver and an executive on top of being an honest politician! She behaves kind of like a scientist using the tech of the time to build new tech. Bernie saw where the tech was going and has been saying that's where we need to go without helping us get there (passing very few bills or building any agencies). People like Warren make Bernie's visions come true. She is the executive who will actually fix things. She passed more in 1 term as a senator that Bernie's entire career!
As a Bernie supporter, this whole debacle has really left me feeling hurt in so many ways. But I will throw my full support behind whoever is the candidate and I will continue to support the progressive movement no matter what. I hope that this blows over and Liz and Bernie can go back to being close friends and stronger allies.
lol. writing "bernie bro" to legitimize content, when in reality a "bernie bro" would never call himself a bernie bro.   fake news bro more like it.
Also a ‚ÄúBernie bro‚Äù. I have been defending Warren though from the beginning and have said for years that she would make a great president. If not Bernie (the OG), at least Warren would still be transformative. I even joined this sub ages ago because I love seeing good news stories about Warren.   I gotta say though, I am thoroughly disappointed in how this has played out. I didn‚Äôt think Warren would allow a smear like that to go uncorrected or clarified. And when someone extends their hand to you on a public stage‚Äîespecially your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of all people‚Äîyou shake it. If you have beef, talk that out privately. This camp has been talking about unity all week and not criticizing candidates and then allow your biggest ally in the race to be smeared as a sexist.  I really want this all to be a misunderstanding. If Liz comes out and explains what happened, I‚Äôm happy to give Warren the benefit of the doubt, move on and pretend this didn‚Äôt happen. If only for the sake of uniting the left.  Understand though what has happened these last 24 hours. You can‚Äôt put this toothpaste back in the tube. This may end up being a disaster for our greatest hope for saving the American empire and the entire world. If this kind of trickery and media manipulation divides our side, we will lose this one last chance.
you should vote for warren shes better
I was really on the fence about the two but... this made up my mind though. I‚Äôd vote for either, but I‚Äôm disappointed in her.
I have strong reservations against Warren in regards to this whole situation, but I'm still going to vote for whomever gets the nomination, even if it's the truly problematic Joe Biden. In regards to front runners Warren is still my #2.
If they (Bernie and Liz) value unity, here's a thought: publicly endorse each other. It would be a major sign that:   A) It's a 35-40% vote for both of them   B) The supporters, endorsements, etc. are all on the same team.   C) They're still friends and allies and CNN failed.
Question to Warren supporters - do you think she is getting good advice from her advisors regarding this?  I just want this ugly episode behind everyone asap.
Bernie  bro isn‚Äôt real. I love you
I wish Warren elaborated more on this. I believe her that she heard this, but I want to know if she believes Bernie was dead serious and thought a woman could not win. This is so far from the positions he has stood for with documented proof of the contrary.  Even better is some joint statement that gives them both cover.
this isn't gonna get you laid man...clever though
[removed]
I am yet to make up my mind on who to vote for. But, the attack on Warren and her supporters from Bernie Bros and his top paid surrogates is not new. And Sanders encourages that cult like following. When was the last time he asked his volunteers to not spread false and negative stories against his opponents?
Pretty sure you're not a Bernie Bro if you're thinking this rationally.

Yes the only thing hurt by this news cycle is democrats.
Bernie wasn't tactful in his convo with Warren.  That's it.  Everything else is dumb drama.  Warren just needs to keep being a BAMF.
CNN just jumped into Fox News territory in my mind.
Or even more so, preventing student loans from being able to be discharged during bankruptcy, being the architect behind the democratic party support for two wars in Iraq, the harassment of Anita Hill during a supreme court confirmation hearing, and the numerous other grievances everyone who would even consider supporting either Warren or Sanders in the first place has towards Biden.  I am legitimately hurt by this whole thing, I don't care who said what, the support that I have for either Sanders or Warren is entirely issues focused and I couldn't care less about any personality/character flaws, or less woke opinions, so long as they remain completely committed to the progressive movements goals around economic, racial, environmental, and political justice.  Both the Warren and Sanders campaign are magnifying this issue for the sake of fundraising, when I'd much rather have seen a debate between Sanders on the different merits of their various policy proposals which have never once been compared against each others during a debate.
They really need to just meet privately, hash things out, and have the two candidates--not proxies or staffers--put out a joint statement of some kind to put this whole thing to bed. All this is doing is helping Biden and Buttigieg.

it was so incredible to hear her speak live, she really works a crowd and the crowd loved her. they're estimating 20k people attended tonight  https://twitter.com/rubycramer/status/1173762572509700096?s=20
For any team members reading the YouTube chat needed moderation. Trolling is to be expected but the constant spamming was obnoxious.
I wonder how long her selfie line took.  EDIT: Holy shit she went until almost midnight.  https://twitter.com/helenbrosnan/status/1173805123568656384?s=21
That looks like a pretty massive turnout! It's been amazing watching Warren's popularity grow over the summer, but it really feels like we're RIGHT on the edge of hitting another massive surge: WarrenNYC is one of the top trends on twitter, Working Families Party officially endorsed Warren, she's basically the only candidate who has clearly come out ahead in all three debates. Don't want to speak too soon of course, but it feels like the tides are about to turn in an even bigger way than they have been
I hope it's at least 10K
[And here‚Äôs the charming Trump supporters who shoes up to counter-protest. ](https://imgur.com/a/GZ0IMLT)  They‚Äôre not sending their best folks.
It was amazing hearing her speak live üòª
She killed it.   Warren is our President.   Dream big. Fight hard.   I seriously sent the link out to everyone I know. I am putting it on the company Facebook page tomorrow. This speech is viral.    She says what we all know to be true. The problem is corruption. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all of it.   Normal people literally can‚Äôt afford the price tag of corruption- and it just needs to stop.  Everyone else always ignores it. It‚Äôs like a doctor ignoring you are being poisoned and just treating the symptoms... oh, so you think the arsenic is giving you a headache?!?!   Stop the corruption   I was in Germany and Belgium and Sweden... and the idea of tax avoidance was abhorrent- why would you cheat and steal from your fellow citizens?   Why would you even think of behaving in such an antisocial way for such small amounts of money?!
Edit: got carried away. Sorry it‚Äôs so long- but the first few statements are good!   I just made this my profile pic. ‚Äú and yet she persevered‚Äù is my background picture.   I am seriously organizing a group of my gfs to get ‚Äòand yet she persevered‚Äô tattoo on our forearms.   I dint think some people realize how angry a lot of us are, just because we don‚Äôt go and shoot ups schools.   I‚Äôm angry. I have set up shit so that when I die, my kids have a fighting chance. I‚Äôm 50, but I‚Äôm not going to suck the blood of my whole family dying slowly- I can‚Äôt afford the life insurance payments.   I will not look away.  Warren fucking killed it tonight. She‚Äôs absolutely right. There is no point in arguing minutiae when there is blatant corruption. This form of Universal care vs that form? It doesn‚Äôt matter, because you will not get shot as long as corruption is okay.   Look at general threads where people are arguing about how much Trump should be allowed to profit from the Presidency... wtf?!? Presidents are not allowed to own private business interests- it‚Äôs pretty ducking basic. We give you the mist powerful position in the world, you aren‚Äôt allowed to make a monarchy.   People throw around a bunch of different words like oligarchy, etc, but they are all the same thing... it‚Äôs a direct return to Aristocracy- inherited wealth and power, achieved without merit. They ignore the founders, like Franklin, who believed there should be no inherited wealth.   What I haven‚Äôt seen Warren say, but I believe are her intentions (based upon her legal views from writings), is the idea of abolitionist family trusts and many forms of incorporating.   What the press isn‚Äôt saying, is that that is the real fear- not taxes. Eliminate most trusts, and shadow corps. They concentrate a lot on other aspects of her history in bankruptcy law- but ignore the glaringly obvious because they can and it serves their purposes. But- Warren is a debate specialist. She‚Äôs niot going to use her best shit (although she was damn good tonight) in the early rounds. Fight hard.  You don‚Äôt argue inherited wealth against Biden- but you kill Trump with it. ‚ÄòHow much tax free money should you be given by your parents? 2 million? 10 million? 200 million?!?!‚Äô  ‚ÄòSo, Mr Trump, how many secret corporations have you owned? I assume we will never see those tax records either...‚Äô  Understand that the Republicans will lie, cheat and steal... but they really dint want a French Revolution scenario.   NC is now lost to Republicans. You only override a governors veto during 9/11 commemorations if you have already lost- because that‚Äôs some desperate shit. Half of them are set up to go to prison or you would just never do it... (I honestly assume the recent election fraud case is going to have numerous members implicated). That was a ‚Äòhail mary‚Äô If I‚Äôve ever seen one, because it still won‚Äôt override the governor in the Senate.    Pelosi is going to keep playing out corruption through every House hearing. Mc Connell is stuck- he can‚Äôt let anything controversial go to a vote because of Trump. Trump is a real idiot. He really is. He didn‚Äôt tank are slowly growing economy because he‚Äôs got a plan... he‚Äôs just that stupid (trade wars are easy to win stupid). Republicans are so used to lies and deceit they just didn‚Äôt realize that Trump actually believed it all.   Think about the reality of Trump- he was a washed up ‚Äòhas been‚Äô who was broke except for money he got from the protected trust from daddy that he couldn‚Äôt destroy... them rhe ‚ÄòApprentice‚Äô thought it would be hysterical to cast him as a great business guy- and he was, as usual, cheap. Republicans do this. Reagan was an actor- and represented the actors union when he was paid to. GW pretended he was from Texas while raised in fucking New England boarding schools.
Hmm, nope, no DISARRAY to be found.  Only love and hope.
Aaaand that‚Äôs a phone wallpaper. Thank you!
Whenever I see the misguided rage about her online, I look to images like this and know that she is believed in.  The most popular candidate will win in the end.
I caught The Professor at Washington Square on C-SPAN yesterday, I think she did pretty well!
Incredible! Over 20K in attendance. Elizabeth Warren is the one y'all. She's leading this movement and I am ready to fight!
Is that picture from k√ºmmel?
God that was overwhelming. It just stinks of desperation. Accusations of racism, dishonesty, and small crowds... [ummm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection)
Do you have a link?
This. Or turn the live chat off completely. Between the MAGA crowd and Bernie Bros it was unreadable.
Direct people to CSPAN- and always ignore tube comments.   Dream big. Fight hard.    https://www.c-span.org/video/?464314-1/senator-elizabeth-warren-campaigns-york-city
Just ignore them, they're angry bitter losers.
Nice to hear something good for a change!
Here‚Äôs the CSPAN. I‚Äôve been telling people that I think Warren has ‚Äòit‚Äô. She proved it tonight. I‚Äôm going to dream big, and fight fucking hard.   https://www.c-span.org/video/?464314-1/senator-elizabeth-warren-campaigns-york-city
Remember in the beginning of the year, when everybody was saying she was washed up, and she was very low in the polls.  I remember even Reddit, and other liberal websites were even saying that her campaign was not going to get off the ground.
I was just there!  Don't know about 10K but it's up there. Energy was wild.   Sideview photo:  [https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fjwbnF\_ai/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fjwbnF_ai/)
20K people attended
All eight of them!
minority rule is pretty accurate
Honestly surprised that many made it to New York
It was everything I wanted it to be. Facts, analogies, solid storytelling and inspiring rhetoric. No cheap shots or sound bites. Just good politics.
The phrase I think you're referring to (at least in relation to Warren) is ["Nevertheless, she persisted."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevertheless,_she_persisted)    The Republicans seem to have a knack for unintentionally making great campaign slogans for their female opponents.  Clinton had "nasty woman" from Trump and Warren also got "impolite arrogant woman" from John Kelly.  They just can't stop putting out sexist phrases that make great slogans.
But what if I just lie LOUDER?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLOmBE6cQB4
I have a feeling that much of the Bernie bro stuff is fake profiles and instigation.
Sanders and Warren have VERY similar platforms. They are friends, and they do not attack or criticize each other. I do not think ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù are online attacking Warren supporters. I think that both candidates are viewed favorably by each other‚Äôs supporters. I am sure that any (or at least most) trolling by ‚ÄúBernie Bros‚Äù is manipulative online behavior with the goal of dividing Warren and Sanders supporters.   Sanders vs Warren is nothing like Sanders vs Clinton. Clinton and Sanders have very different records, policy positions, and ethics. Their huge differences, the media bias, and the frustration over the superdelegate system all contributed to the toxic online behavior of some Bernie supporters. This is a very different situation where none of those factors exist. I think it‚Äôs important to recognize this.
Sanders people? Naw. I was pro Sanders. But I really don't think he could win. I'm sorry to say that. Republicans see him as too far left. Some Republicans see the need to get rid of tRump. We need them to vote blue.
I heard from national that they stopped ‚Äòcounting heads‚Äô at 20k!
CSPAN link   https://www.c-span.org/video/?464314-1/senator-elizabeth-warren-campaigns-york-city  Dream big. Fight hard.
**Nevertheless, she persisted**  "Nevertheless, she persisted" is an expression adopted by the feminist movement, especially in the United States. It became popular in 2017 after the United States Senate voted to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren's objections to confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions as U.S. Attorney General. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made this remark in defense of the silencing, during his comments following the vote.  The expression went viral as feminists posted it on social media with hashtag references to other women.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
Thank you, we're going to have to put a link to Warren's youtube channel on the sidebar.
It‚Äôs stopped. Can‚Äôt vuew üòî
Agreed. He may have some obnoxious fans, but we need to assume anyone trying to sow discord between democratic candidates' followings is intending to...well, sow discord in the democratic party. Please, everyone! When you begin an argument with anyone else claiming to support the Dem party, please just attempt to find common ground and agree we are all trying to support what's right!!  Imagine if everyone in the Dem party decided to keep a cool head and work toward ridding our government of the Republican scourge. We would be unstoppable!! And we need to be unstoppable, because if we are stoppable, it will be through our own doing. Be civil, be respectful, be progressive!!
A thousand times this. Thank you.
It may have started that way but his real supporters have definitely taken up a lot of the talking points.
They were viciously attacking Warren on twitter yesterday when received that huge endorsement from the family org that had endorsed Bernie last time. It was really really ugly. It‚Äôs a very dark percentage of his supporters.
Another place where Warren is speaking, is the Polk Country Democrat dinner in Iowa, that they are going to show on C Span this weekend.
I don't think we need Republican votes at all.  They're a nice to have, but Clinton had a host of issues that caused a low turnout and still won by millions of votes.  We just need to get people in the right states to show up.
Oh wow, then I stand corrected! I seriously underestimated. That is phenomenal!
It starts at the end for me, but you can drag the progress marker back to the start to watch it.
This 100%. I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter 1st, Warren is my 2nd. Bernie and Warren don‚Äôt bash each, neither should we.
Even if that's true, the point remains that we're all on the same team.
See: Super ChapoTrapHouse Bros, only for Wii U
Yeah I saw that. We need to have discord in the party. No infighting.
I went to CSPAN. Incredible. She honestly killed it. I copied and saved the link. Phenomenal.   Warren is my president.   https://www.c-span.org/video/?464314-1/senator-elizabeth-warren-campaigns-york-city
Word as well!  While I have my favorites in the party, any discord that the MAGA crowd can use will use it, even if they have to create it themselves.  I think for any Democrat, what we want is a win for the White House and both houses of congress, because it means a win for everyone and their rights.
üëç
Me too, this is mostly the Biden backers and the Russians both of whom would love Biden to win and would love for Bernie and Warren voters to not support the other candidate if one of them drops out.
True, in fact, they have had each other's backs in the debates, even though the networks want them to shread each other.
Tell that to them.
We need to work together. We need to show our unity and others will join us. It's not just an election this time, it's our country. It's our global reputation, which right now isn't great.
That is why I am taking the stance that I will vote for my favorate in the primaries, but will vote for the nominee, and support then 100 percent in the general election, because any one of those Democrats would be way better then Trump.
Silver lining?
I‚Äôm actually glad Bloomberg is fair game.  He‚Äôs not a real Democrat and absolutely deserves what he has coming to him from ALL of the real patriots on the stage.  Give ‚Äòem hell, Liz!
If Bloomberg ends up being the nominee, it'll confirm that American voters care more about wealth, ads, and appealing sound bites than actual substance. 2 awful billionaires in a row. Sorry if this sounds pretentious but I'm getting really frustrated with how dumb the electorate has proven itself to be.
Maybe, but I feel like debates have less of an effect than they used to. Arguably, Clinton won all 3 debates in '16 and I don't feel like it changed many minds. Even so, I want see them all call Bloomberg out on his hubris, so it should be entertaining at the very least.
Damn Liz, I'm a Bernie guy but I recognize a good tweet when I see one.
She's destroying him in this debate.  Sweep the leg, Liz!
This reminds me why I loved Warren.
Elizabeth Warren:   Makes a promise.   Delivers.
This turned out to be a teaser trailer.
I consider him a miniboss that the candidates need to overcome in order to reach the general election.  He's absolutely carpet bombing all forms of media with his nonsense, and it's launched him up to 19% in the polls.  Advertising is far more influential on low-information voters than I think we like to believe.  Where I get additionally concerned is that if he starts spending his megabillions attacking other candidates, it could have lasting detrimental effects all the way into the general.
Warren should bring this one out on the debate stage.  Great tweet.
**yasss drag him**
I'm glad he got into the debate, because it's the only way to answer his juggernaut of campaign ads
Go get em
With a fork and knife?
I'm a Bernie supporter but my god, Warren was fire last night. Absolutely bodied Bloomberg. It reminded me of 2015 Warren. Well done, Senator, well done.
Of course. There is no justifiable reason that a guy polling at 15% should not be allowed in the debates. Is it terrible that he's trying to buy the election? Yes, but he does have support.
[removed]
As a New Yorker, Bloomberg did a great job here with some problematic things happening.
[removed]
Ikr?  At first I was mad that Bloomberg made the debate stage, but then I realized that this is the first time he is actually going to be subjected to harsh push back.
If Bloomberg is the nominee, I honestly have no idea how I'd vote.
Nothing new there.  The fact that Trump is president should be enough to fear that this country isn't capable of governing itself.
True to a degree. But remember, one good debate performance also catapulted Klobuchar from obscurity to this ‚Äúsurging‚Äù narrative that helped her enormously both in NH and in overall media attention. Part of it is just a recency effect I think‚Äîwhen debates happen just before people vote it can influence their thinking, especially if they‚Äôre undecided.
What‚Äôs odd that is more people watch debates now. 538 did a piece on this in their podcast, talking about how they weren‚Äôt even a big deal until recently, and only watched by insiders. I feel like modern debates don‚Äôt really convince anyone of anything, since most of it is repetitive talking points.  What clearly matters more are YouTube ads.
I think you are wrong. Debates often comes with waves of donations for the candidates who do well.
Debates in the general election matter very little, because we are increasingly polarized and people know which side they are on. In the primary, where everyone is on the same ‚Äúteam‚Äù and is well liked by most voters (except Bloomberg), they can cause big shifts in polls. See Kamala last summer, see Klobuchar last week.
The biggest problem with debates is that not a lot of people tune in, they rely on the headlines and clips the next day. Unfortunately, the media outlets are going to paint their own story and narrative regardless of the true context of the live debates. I wouldn't be suprised if you see a lot of "Bloomberg Highlights" after tonight for one more final push by this clown before Super T.
At least it's a chance for him to be vetted.  Running nonstop commercials about  him with Obama without having to face hard questions or push back is why he is rising in polls so fast.  And news stations will show the highlights even if most people don't watch the actual debates, so it's a chance to see him get taken down a peg or two.
She won the 1st one hand down , but trump won the 2nd one and 3rd one was basically a tie
Clinton only won 2 of the debates. Trump won the second one after his disastrous first one.
Also, during one of those debates Clinton used the infamous ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù line which didn‚Äôt work it in her favor.
[removed]
I am so worried about this.  That if it turns out that Bloomberg and Sanders emerge after Super Tuesday as the front runners, we will have full on scorched earth against each other.  Sanders using his supporters and Bloomberg using  his wads of cash.  And we end up so bruised that the vote is suppressed and Trump ekes out a win.  I feel a lot like this election is ours to lose; and yet, we might eff it up yet again.
They didn‚Äôt relax the donor threshold or polls for others. People that had the required number of donors but not the polling or vice versa weren‚Äôt allowed on stage.
Hey. This hurts my soul but I have to remove for rule four. Please refrain from calling him a snake. The rest is fine.
Some. Problematic. Things?  Kalief Browder and a whole lotta brown folks would say differently.
As a Puerto Rican New Yorker I can say that his stop and frisk bullshit directly affected people in my family and that he‚Äôs a scum bag.
I appreciate your perspective but it's pretty clear you aren't a person of color.
It sounds you were never unconstitutionally stopped and frisked, right?
Can you clarify?  That's a very vague comment.
Not in education. I was a teacher under his administration. And it was terrible. You can‚Äôt run a city like a business.
[removed]
I understand your frustration but that kind of thinking is counterproductive if you want to see real change. Yes the DNC is disgustingly corrupt, and no, Bloomberg shouldn't be able to buy his way on stage, but what other path to real change is there other than through the Democratic primary at this point in time? Warren and Sanders both recognize this.
Wait what. If you're unhappy with him joining the race, then vote against him.
Look at what he's done and not his empty words.
One candidate is an existential threat to the country and the other is a moderate republican who will reform our healthcare system to provide a public option.   To me, this isn‚Äôt even a difficult question.  I am going to plug my nose and vote for ANY Dem: Bernie, Mike, Pete, Liz, Amy, or Biden.   Please vote Blue no Matter Who. Abstaining or voting 3rd party is a vote for Donald Trump.
Just stop that.  I don't like Bloomberg even the tiniest little bit; but Trump is an existential threat to people of color, women, immigrants, anyone with integrity who works for the federal government, and marginalized people.  To not vote for the nominee is inexcusable.  It's basically saying you are cool with Trump picking Ruth Bader Ginsberg's replacement and that it's cool for us to ensure that climate changes makes this country unlivable in 30 years.  Learn the difference between profound disappointment and existential threat.
I'm going to vote for the candidate who believes in climate change and is working to address it.
Swing state voter?
True dat.  EDIT: I think I remember hearing that because of the debate she picked up the last-minute decision voters.  That's a good thing to remember.
One? I remember she was getting really high marks all the way back in October and November by going after Warren and Pete.  I don't think a singular debate matters, but the trend over several debates actually does. It's why people were pissed off at the lack of debates in 2016.
Same thing happened to Kamala Harris after that one debate.
100%  Everytime before a debate OR a primary/caucus the media always talks about something for no reason and then it happens. Koblosurge, Pete possibly winning, Biden's campaign in shambles, Bloomberg (which attributed to his polling), and now combative Warren.   It was the reason why Biden and Warren surged in Summer to Fall. It was the reason Kamala exploded in popularity and died down.  And finally, it was the reason why partly Sanders lost the primaries and Clinton was completely painted as absolutely evil and conniving.   Trump is literally the only one who took the media narrative and twisted it into a positive.
I've already decided who I'll vote for. A debate isn't going to change my mind now.
Oh man, but they're all Bloomberg, all the time now!
what matters more than the debates is how the pundits and MSM choose to spin them. They are literally deciding who are nominee is going to be. They want Sanders/Trump.
Debate clips however are played over and over again in the media; so that part does effect perception.
I don't understand why most people don't use an Adblocker for youtube
That is also a  fair point I had not considered.
Well someone in the comments was right. She killed last night and apparently had some pretty baller fundraising numbers.
No, that was at a fund raiser: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_of_deplorables  She hadn't planned to deploy that to the public.
We're trying to enforce rule 4 as fairly as possible and despite many of us having similar feelings about Bloomberg we want to keep things centered on policy instead of straight attacks. Criticizing him for past statements/policy is more than welcome though. Especially since Bloomberg has so many skeletons in his closet that it's been mistaken for a morgue.  &#x200B;  Edit: typo
Bloomberg would still need to get people to vote for him. I would hope that money isn't enough to win.
The donor threshold never kept anyone out. Polling is an actual measure of voting support.   It would literally be unethical for Bloomberg to ask regular people to donate money to him, a billionaire, just so he can appear on stage. It would be unethical for the DNC to push him to do so.
Yeah, Bloomberg is way better off now than had he not made the debate stage, huh?
updated* No worries.
I guess you didn‚Äôt read my whole post ?
As a child I remember literally every teacher was on their way to fight Bloomberg. It was kind of funny, they absolutely despised him and talk about protesting randomly to us elementary/middle school kids.
Removed. There is nothing about that comment indicating the user is trolling. In the future if you suspect a comment is trolling simply report it and move on.
The path to change is losing until you understand why you're losing and then you change to stop it from happening. I abstained in 2016 and I registered democrat this year to vote for either Bernie or Warren, but the moment I saw that headline I knew I made a mistake. I'm ashamed that my name is tied to this party now. I won't participate in your primary until you start holding fair elections, I don't think that's too much to expect.
I think that they are unhappy that the party is allowing Bloomberg to run as a Democrat. Which I totally understand.
That would only legitimize the party allowing someone to buy their way into the election. It's the exact type of blatant corruption that I want to see gone and I refuse to be a part of it. You guys want independents to come to your side then stop fucking cheating in your primaries.
Absolutely. The US government can survive even Bloomberg. Trump is out here declaring himself the supreme law enforcement officer, able to order prosecutors around to protect his cronies.   There is no debate in which one I'd vote for if forced into that choice, but I really hope that doesn't happen.
Trump is very bad and I will vote for any Dem nom but Bloomberg's role in Stop and Frisk and Redlining and his comments in the last decade has been god awful for minorities. I only just learned about his NDA with the women in his companies because of this debate which makes it even worse.  I thought the worst we'll ever get is Biden who at least will do some improvement but Bloomberg's previous positions and recent statements is just incredibly awful to the point his election is just an election on a more mild form of racism/sexism.  Still would vote for the nominee, don't think he will be one anyways.
In Nevada, which is a Caucus like Iowa, it's especially important to be the second choice of most candidates. So in that regard this debate is particularly important.
I don‚Äôt really recall her ‚Äúgoing after‚Äù Warren. She drew contrasts, but it didn‚Äôt strike me as the aggressive style of contrast. She‚Äôs gone after Pete much harder.   If we end up saddled with a centrist nominee, she‚Äôs by far my top choice.
There's a large part of the electorate who hasn't decided.
I've notice some Bernie supporters have turned it into a running joke, by posting  nice things about Bloomberg and then below putting "Paid for by Bloomberg for President".  Which is kind of funny.
You really think they want "Sanders/Trump"?  I think they want "Insert Moderate/Trump".
> They are literally deciding who are nominee is going to be. They want Sanders/Trump.  Yeah, that doesn't reflect what I see in the media at all. Unless by media you mean "social media".
Right, but that‚Äôs usually just the zingers and little about the policy differences. This is why Trump won the nomination. Endless clips of him being a douche to the other candidates made people laugh.
Damn. I totally misremembered that.
Boom! Moderator burn. Good luck Bloomberg.
It turned into people taking pot shots at him and bringing him down. But it doesn‚Äôt change that ethically,  he bought that spot, which I dangerous. What if he was actually charismatic and spoke well and further convinced America he was a good choice?   We need to get money out of politics. there are many good people who would make an excellent president but no one hears of them because they‚Äôre too poor to even consider running for anything.
I did, what do you think I am missing?
Don't be obstinate. You joined the party for a reason (the same one I did in 2016). You just have one last thing to do.   The party is garbage, but so is the one in charge. This one is better, and there are some decent politicians running. Hold your nose and do what needs to be done.
I get it, but if you're unhappy with the party, not voting isn't going to change. You can't change something if you don't participate.
Vote for the candidates (you had the right choices) that prioritize rooting out corruption. That is the only shot to cleanse the party (and hopefully the country).  Independents don't have a lot of clout, so I would advise being strategic (as you understand what you were doing to be).
Same, honestly. At least she's straightforward as to who she is, politically speaking.
I long for the days of just corporations just trying to sell me things I don't need...
It's shallow af, but sometimes the zingers are at least based on reality.  I would like Bloomberg to be the subject of a few of those.  Like Warren maybe saying "while you were busy buying your way into this race, I was busy meeting and listening to real people talk about their lives and how this economy hasn't worked for them"  Biden can after Bloomberg for claiming close ties to Obama that did not exist.
She got asked about it during a debate, though. But yeah, she wasn't unwise enough to just come out and think it was a winning move.
I already acknowledged that there were problems with his tenure.  No need to aggressively hop on me.
I will happily vote in the general. I'm also happily registering as independent and abstaining from this farce of a primary.
Instead we have them trying to sell us a candidate we don't need.
Warren Calls for Barr to Resign or Face Impeachment
YES. I remember yesterday some us wanted her to do exactly this.
She‚Äôs the one real leader in this race and this is the right call.   Now she should say it on every TV show she can get herself on, or stage a protest, or *something* to show the people not on Twitter she‚Äôs serious about fighting Trump
Fantastic! She needs to hammer this anti-corruption rhetoric as long as possible, because it has bi-partisan support.
This is just one part of a great twitter thread. Glad to see Warren come out swinging against Trump and Barr for corrupting the DOJ:  [https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1227642418650062850](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1227642418650062850)
I can't help but worry that people don't pay enough attention to winning back the Senate in 2020.  As long as Mitch McConnell is majority leader, Congress will forever be on life-support. Depriving him of a majority should be the 2nd most important project after winning back the White House.
Throwback to May last year when Warren, after studying the Mueller report, took to the Senate floor to lay out the [case for impeachment in detail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb0qvpYaK08).
Wish we could skip the impeachment on Barr and just move him straight to prison, after the guilty verdict at trial of course. That is the only place he deserves along with Impeached POTUS and the entire Trump family and cabinet.
Yes..... more impeachments.    I think we should impeach trump again as well.    Can we impeach Tucker Carlson while we are at it.??
A Conservative Judge Draws a Line in the Sand With the Trump Administration  Outraged the attorney general had ignored a court order, he authors a blistering opinion rebuking William Barr for overstepping his constitutional authority.  https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/02/12/a-conservative-judge-draws-a-line-in-the-sand-with-trump-administration-114185
and this impeachment will go any different to Trumps?  All that can fix things is removing republicans from office.
It feels like Republicans let Trump do whatever he wants. Like a parent with an extremely spoiled brat for a child. The Republican tolerate actions they would never under any Democrat ever. Obama would have gotten hit with articles of impeachment for even looking at Ukraine too nicely.    I don't believe Barr has a conscience. And it's hard to believe in justice after only Mitt Romney voted to remove him. Susan Collins actually *believed* that Trump would learn something. Trump then abuses power by firing people- one of the articles against him.  She needs backup if this is going to work. How many other Senators and representatives has she got backing her Barr's resignation? This needs to hit him like a ton of bricks.
The more corrupt the man in office - the better for Warren's campaign as the anti-corruption candidate.
Trump and his goons are so stupid they can't help but blunder their way into impeachment and criminal cases.
That's my LIZ
such an empty threat
She needs to bring the argument against corruption right here to the AG. Show us you're doing value and the people might come back, or at least I hope.
Yes, she needs more of this.
^Great idea!   What can we do to help amplify the message as well?
Unfortunately, none of this will matter since Mitch McConnell is Senate Majority Leader.
This is her big strength. Her anti corruption platform and history is amazing.
She can be the hammer to their authoritarian sickle!
That thread was lit.
Read an article today that mentioned how much her campaign not only worked for her, but actively helped local and state Dems with their elections, way more than the other candidates' campaigns.  This needs to be pushed more, about how Warren recognizes the importance of local, state and down ballot campaigns and actively supports them.
Considering a quarter of Democrats think Bernie Sanders should be the nominee, you're absolutely right. Too many aren't thinking about the house and senate.
This is when I came all in. As a black woman, I was on the obligated Harris train up till that point. The contrast between how they handled it was day and night. Harris edging her bets, Warren deceive in her moral convention. I have been dismayed at how much she has pulled away from the accountability message as the campaign wore on
POTUS Warren‚Äôs AG is going to be veeeeery busy
Barr takes control of legal matters of interest to Trump, including Stone sentencing   Attorney General William Barr's intervention in Roger Stone's case wasn't the first time senior political appointees reached into a case involving an ex-Trump aide, officials say.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/barr-takes-control-legal-matters-interest-trump-including-stone-sentencing-n1135231
They're not stupid, they just don't care and don't believe they'll face any serious consequences.
Email her team? Tweet her senior campaign staff?   Honestly her media strategy has been one of the most frustrating aspects of her campaign. She needed to embrace national media way way earlier. Of course she‚Äôs wonderful in person but she can‚Äôt meet everyone.   She needs to be on camera.
Elizabeth Warren jumps to first place in new MoveOn straw poll with 37%
Warren is up 31 points from the last straw poll taken of MoveOn members and edges out her closest rival, Sanders by over 20 points. Warren is also the top second choice with 25%.
I hope this trend continues.  Liz is the most inspiring candidate in the race.  There is an excitement about her - *even though* she's laying out detailed policy proposals :)
I think it should be a rule that if you get less than Mike Gravel in any poll you're required to drop out of the race.
I've been donating to both Warren and Sanders. I truly like and respect them both. I worked on Sanders' campaign and see a lot of the same energy building for Warren from her supporters but in a more composed fashion.      I think Sanders previous campaign threw open the door for the ideas that Warren actually has the capacity to deliver on (and has also been speaking about for years). I find her to be excellent at the nuts and bolts of governance and, moreover, to be pointed in her communications and explanations. She also has so many "gotcha" moments on video that are delicious to watch.      Today I donated $50 to her instead of my weekly $25/$25.      I might donate to Sanders again depending on how things shape up. I certainly will if he were nominated.      That said I am so excited about Warren...and totally wondering who would make a good running mate.
Full results are here: http://MoveOn.org/results  Good to see that Warren is also the top second choice candidate nationwide and in the earliest primary states.
Good or bad, let's remember polls don't mean much this far from the first primary.  &#x200B;  Edit: though they do have the advantage of reminding me of the names of candidates I keep forgetting even exist. Wayne Messam? Seth Moulton? Mike Gravel? I feel like pollsters invent random candidate names to see how many people just close their eyes and pick the name their finger lands on.
Time for AOC to endorse!
Is anyone here aware of any interfering factors in this poll?  I don't mean unethically, but because a straw poll isn't serious business it's common to request your supporters to respond.  I'm mainly referring to [this call for voting in the MoveOn poll, which many of us responded to](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/c1usyp/action_go_support_warren_in_the_moveonorg_straw/).  I didn't get that link but I think I got directed to vote in the poll from somewhere else.  High five I guess.  The moral is don't overestimate what this means for normal polling.  This does mean that Warren has a comparatively large number of high-information moderately-involved supporters who got called to action.  We already knew Warren leads in high-information progressive democrats, and high-information voters more broadly are often a leading indicator in where a race will shift.  (Because high information voters are more informed on buried scandal and have been exposed to more rhetoric from candidates, which is where the general electorate ends up months later.)    So the MoveOn straw poll isn't insignificant but it shows very different things than a representative randomized poll.
Good to hear! While Sanders is my top choice, she‚Äôs definitely a great second choice for me.
Hopefully Warren continues rising, but good to know polls are not that useful yet, and straw polls are especially not predictive of anything.
Biden really is the Jeb Bush of 2020.
I just want to remind everyone that this is very early in the race but also a horribly conducted poll, 538 didn‚Äôt even score it, which is not a great sign.
She will lose the general election
She will be the nominee. The debates will make it even more clear to people that she should be the one. That's exactly what happened in 2008, when seeing Obama on a stage with Hillary (and others) throughout he summer of 2007 made it clear to people that he was the best candidate.  **EDIT:** I will just add that the debates in 2007 started in April and they had more than one per month throughout that summer and into 2008. Comparatively, the very first Democratic debate of the 2016 election was in **October** of 2015, which gave not enough time for any competitor of Hillary to generate enough organic support. Hillary was too far ahead by then (over a 50 point lead at times in 2015) to allow some other candidate to overcome her lead. Except that her lead was built too much on name recognition and not enough based on raw political ability.  So if it's not too obvious, in a way, this year Biden is Hillary 2008 (more national name recognition, more centrist) and Liz Warren is Obama (better politician, more progressive, more visionary). Except Joe has less of a lead than Hillary had in 2008.
[removed]
I'd argue there's excitement *because* she's putting out detailed policy proposals. At this point the voters want someone who can at least lay out a framework for their ideas, and we all hope they'll be able to execute on them
[removed]
[removed]
I just can't wait for the 3rd and 4th debate when all the people that don't actually have support can't participate.
I would like to offer his silent rock drop video as evidence for this argument!
I donated $5 to her last week (I know it's not much but I'm not a very wealthy person) and plan to give at least that much each week until the election. Every time I hear her talk, I feel inspired and hopeful for the future she's working towards.
Right. These are the two (realistic) candidates I'd head to the polls smiling to vote for. Still, Warren is a head above. They're both tenacious and principled, but Warren has an intellectual curiosity and work ethic that I admire so much.
I think that's the part that gets me most excited. Even if she's not their first choice, it sounds like most progressives would be satisfied or even also thrilled to have her. She's definitely what we need right now.
C'mon, everyone knows Mike Gravel.
Well to be fair it was also posted on [S4P](https://np.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/c1wm5a/moveon_has_a_2020_presidential_strawpoll_vote/?utm_source=reddit-android) and Sanders fans tend to brigade these kind of polls so if anything it should have skewed towards him. Also it's members only and MoveOn voted for Sanders by 79% in 2016.
[removed]
History says otherwise. Hillary won the popular vote, and Warren is a much stronger candidate.
I'm a huge Bernie supporter, and have been donating monthly to his campaign for 3 years now... I just donated to Warren for the first time, and plan on doing it again. Very pleased with how she is running her campaign. I think she can pull this off.
[deleted]
Is this a impression of a preteen edgelord?
Seconding this--after three years of what's amounted to executive chaos, a list of well-thought-out policy proposals is as far as we can get from Trump. The public's starting to realize that plans beat out Twitter policy, and it shows.
I agree.  Her well articulated policy proposals are a breath of fresh air.  I was just making fun of the people who do not see the difference between a detailed plan and a campaign slogan.
I'd just tack on that it's because of her detailed proposals _and_ that she's a charismatic and thoughtful communicator. Without that second part, she'd be much like another candidate in 2016 who had a laundry list of detailed policy proposals, and look where that got her.
I would say that this could be a reason why she should stay in Congress. The executive branch doesn‚Äôt write up policies they can support policies and sign them. She‚Äôs coming up with a ton of policies showing that she is a powerhouse and should be in the branch of government that actually passes laws, we would be losing a very powerful person from Congress if she leaves.
I have seen far too many of these exact comments, with these exact concerns, stated this exact way, bringing up two issues that have been thoroughly debunked.   1. She's [co-sponsoring Bernie's Medicare-for-All proposal](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-joins-sanders-13-other-senators-to-reintroduce-medicare-for-all) in the Senate. There is nothing wishy-washy about it; she fully supports Medicare-for-All, and has said [‚Äúthere‚Äôs no excuse for stopping at half-measures.‚Äù](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/2020-democrats-medicare-for-all-public-option.html) 2. No one has sworn off big donations for the general (not even Bernie), because Trump has over [$97 million in his campaign fund](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P80001571/), which will certainly balloon even more as we move toward the general election, and Democrats know that grassroots funding campaigns cannot generate that level of funding and power.  >I‚Äôm not looking to fight about these topics; I‚Äôm just concerned about them. From one supporter to another, we‚Äôre on the same team.   ["Enter The Concern Troll"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2014/01/13/enter-the-concern-troll/?utm_term=.3daa9077aa36)
She has signed onto M4A but I think the reason that she hasn't gotten into the specifics is probably because she has a plan of her own in the works. Considering the depth and number of proposals that she has already released reframing the debate it makes sense that she would have her own for health care as well, in fact she already has a proposal out that would let the government manufacture generic forms of drugs like insulin and allow Medicare to negotiate. I think she's likely going to time the release of the proposal around a significant event like she has with her other plans, and she has plenty of time to do that considering how far out we are right now.
On the Medicare For All bill that's currently on the table, I'm highly skeptical of it since I work in healthcare. This industry is notoriously resistant to change and lacks agility in the face of mandated modernization. To be clear, this goes beyond "change always comes hard," there is just a culture of slow and resistant change in this sector. My take on it is because clinical practice is slow to change due to its cautious and overly analytical nature. We take years to build evidence and come out with new guidelines and then it takes another couple years for providers to individually change their practice accordingly.   We saw this problem with the [HITECH Act](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5020152/) where five years after implementation, we fell short on a lot of the goals. We barely met the lowest bar, which was electronic health record implementation across the board for all healthcare organizations (and there are still some HCOs that are still using paper records).   Now look at the [M4A bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384/text) on the table. A 2-year implementation schedule after the bill passes and only two years to scale down the private health insurance industry to zero. Warren's response reads to me as someone who is cautious of doing damage in attempting to reach a goal.   It sounds completely in line with who she is because she wants to get everyone to the table to make sure we're doing things right so on the healthcare front. It's not enough for me that someone has an idea, it matters to me how we get to that idea. If the specifics of this is what Bernie is running on, I'm actually opposed to it because it would mean a lot of hell for myself and my colleagues. Realistically speaking I could imagine a lot of healthcare organizations having to shutdown or reduce staff to stay afloat during the transition period and beyond. That leaves huge holes for people to the fall through.
It took a week longer than Sanders but Warren did sign TYT's Progressive Policy Pledge, one point of which was Medicare for All.  That's clearly a commitment to some form of Medicare for All but Warren is holding back announcing that policy for some reason.  We can expect her to make a splash.  The lack of a healthcare policy is a fair reason to be skeptical, so that pledge is reassuring.  It's also from a media powerhouse that Warren would pay dearly for betraying her word to.  As far as the general election, I actually agree with the money thing as strategy and can explain why.  The concern is of course corruption, which Warren has proven herself reliably against.  Assuming Warren becomes the Democratic Nominee, the party platform will be set.  Donors will not have influence over that platform.  But sadly US elections have been shown to be deeply affected by advertising and media portrayal.  ***Unilateral disarmament is not a smart strategy.***    For Bernie, refusing any big-money finance in the final stretch creates a possible financial issue if he becomes the nominee, because any big-money democratic ads will come from PACs he doesn't have any leverage over.  If he even coordinates the ad money it's as good as compromising on his principled position, which will be (mostly unfairly) spun and have a political price.  I'd rather just not make the promise in a way that becomes confusing to voters later or cedes control of Democratic messaging to more outside groups when the nominee right now really needs to lead the entire movement.  Because Trump sure controls his movement.  In both cases a progressive nominee has wealthy anti-Trump donors between a rock and a hard place.  There is no reason to give them a say in selecting the presidential cabinet (like Obama allowed the banks to).  But trading cabinet selections for cash is my only hypothetical concern.  Considering Warren was going to fight *Hillary* over dirty regulators, I'm betting we can trust Warren.  I tend to go into too much detail but that's the strategy, Mr.
You're right, she hasn't spelled out her own M4A plan yet, but she has co-sponsored Bernie's plan. So that should be somewhat encouraging to progressives.   But I believe one of the sticking points in the Warren/Sanders fight (and I think at some point in the debates they will come to blows) will be over this, because I really doubt Warren will adopt Bernie's strategy of effective nationalization of the health insurance industry.   Do I think Bernie's plan is a good one? Hell yeah.  Do I think most voters will go along with it? Not a chance.   People are extremely protective about their healthcare plans. I think Warren knows this, and I imagine she'll be taking an incrementalist approach to solving it, with a public option alongside more regulated private insurance for the foreseeable future. That is definitely not Bernie's plan, and if the primary race goes like I think it will, will be the primary line drawn between the two.   I agree with Warren here, but more revolution minded voters will probably back Bernie. There's logic behind both approaches. I just think Warren's is the winning one.  EDIT: ....and I was wrong on this. Warren gives an unqualified endorsement of the same plan for health care that Bernie has. I'm surprised but pleased!
A common criticism for all genders /s
I want some of them to still represent us, but do it in the senate and the house!
Yeah. Kind of BS that Warren isn't on stage with the other front runners but maybe they'll deliberately reshuffle for July. Could be a good opportunity for her to stand out and build the momentum. But I really want to see her and Bernie able to debate nuances of progressive policy on the same stage instead of each of them squaring off against a bunch of centrists. I'm cool with either of them as the nominee.
I think everyone deserves a chance, but if after campaigning and a debate they can't muster support, we should focus on the candidates that do.
COUGH De Blasio COUGH
Great video! I donated hoping he'd make the debates just to see him yell at the centrists, fingers crossed for next month. Kind of embarrassing for Seth Moulton, who has the best manufactured moderate Dem presidential resume imaginable, to be losing to someone who isn't even running to win.
He's a spry 89 years old.
Good, that makes the result more significant.  I'm loving the optimism in these comments.
Will you stop with that kind of shit? Why can't you make a post praising Warren without it turning into "Shit on Sanders and Sanders Supporters" thread?  Dont you realize that many of those Supporters you're disparaging also love Warren just as much?

I said lose the general election, not win the popular vote.
I really hope that if Warren emerges as the leader, all Bernie supporters will embrace her like you. Her plans overlap a ton with Bernie's and I just don't see any reason to not like her if you like Bernie.  Of course, I also hope Democrats will all rally around Bernie if he wins the nomination. However, polling I have seen suggests that Warren is better positioned to win. Specifically, she is close to Bernie in terms of polls asking voters about their "first choice," but then she leads everyone as a "second choice" and "third choice." Bernie is like second place behind Biden as a "first choice" candidate but then he's ranked very low as voters' second or third choice.  So basically, you either love Bernie or you don't, and I don't see that as a winning formula. The data really suggests Elizabeth Warren will be the one.
This can‚Äôt be true! Because that would mean that folks who voted for Bernie might not just have been sexist idiots?!?! That might mean they actually disagreed with Hilary‚Äôs policies! This can‚Äôt be!!!!!! /s
It's just an analogy. Analogies offer useful comparative examples.  Am I also stuck in 2008 if I make a comparison to that election? Not every mention of Hillary Clinton means someone is stuck in the past.
Executive chaos is a fantastic term and I think I'll start using it!
Warren‚Äôs policies are most progressive than Clinton‚Äôs were plus Warren isn‚Äôt going to any fundraisers unlike Clinton
The president's endorsement of a bill goes really far (or it used to I suppose) I mean just look at how slimy Mitch McConnell bends over backwards to never vote on a bill the president doesn't support

>The lack of a healthcare policy is a fair reason to be skeptical  Thank you for being reasonable about this.  I support Bernie over Warren, and a big reason why is the healthcare issue. Every other Warren supporters swears that there is no daylight between Sanders and Warren on healthcare. I know that he'll fight like hell and settle for nothing less than single payer, while I suspect that Warren would be inclined to pursue a public option as a compromise path. Of course, I'd like to be proven wrong, and it would be great to see Warren draft some legislation of her own.   &#x200B;  As regards the money issue: I don't think most people think Warren would be corrupted by money in the general election. At least I don't think she would be corrupted. It's just a bad look. It's not an action that's consistent with the idea that money corrupts politics.   &#x200B;  >If he even coordinates the ad money it's as good as compromising on his principled position  &#x200B;  It's already supposed to be illegal to for a candidate to coordinate with a PAC. They are supposed to be completely independent from one another. Though, of course, the reality is they never are, and the rule is not enforced.
The irony is that Sherrod Brown is praised for this exact thing lmao
Do we know the dates for the July debates yet?
I definitely think it's a good thing. This is the first debate, and this is day one. If she didn't have the momentum I might be annoyed, but all eyes will be on her.  I mean, if it was Bernie instead of Warren, I'd be pretty mad. He'd get a chance to capture the excitement of the first debate, to stake a claim to the ideas he and Warren share. He would get the attention and it would take some of the wind out of her sails. This way she gets to forge her own path forward.
It's literally just a response giving the facts as to whether or not the poll is skewed towards Warren? Exactly what did I say that can be interpreted as disparaging Sanders?
Right, because Trump, Obama and Clinton (Bill) were all predictable winners.
I'll do you one better and happily campaign my ass off for Warren if she is the top runner for the left wing after the next couple months!
I‚Äôm still going Bernie because I was there in 2016 and I believe his convictions are the strongest. But if he‚Äôs 1A, Liz Warren is 1B. I initially thought the DNA test blunder was too big to overcome but we are way past that now and I think she handled it fairly well.  The right won‚Äôt give it up, but they think calling Bernie a socialist is enough to stop people voting for him, so fuck what they think.
Almost all Bernie supporters would embrace Warren enthusiastically if she gets the nom. The reverse is not as true.
you ok?
Haha I totally feel you. So frustrating...
I think discussions about Hillary are still useful in the interest of not letting the past repeat itself. When I saw Biden's announcement video where he chose to focus exclusively on Trump's racist comments, I remember thinking, "Why on earth is he using HRC's playbook? It didn't work then, it won't work now." Then at the South Carolina Democratic Convention, he gave an unfocused, meandering laundry list as if he was reading the bullet points off his own campaign website, another red flag that flashes back to HRC.  HRC was a terrible candidate and if Joe Biden can't understand why that was so and learn from it, he's just as bad and "unelectable." So yeah, Hillary is still fair game to talk about.
The ADHD presidency: lots of ideas, lots of energy,  very little follow through
Yeah but they don‚Äôt write up bills and debate them like on Congress
It's the vagueness that worries me. Why not clear that up?
I believe they are the 30 and 31 of July, at least that is what is written in my calendar
>Sanders fans tend to brigade these kind of polls
voters proved in 2016 that they are willing to vote for trump if the alternative is too liberal.  Both Clintons are typically more center of the road (especially during election time) but Bernie‚Äôs success forced Hilary to move more to the left than she would have like to be... and it cost her.    Warren is far more liberal than Hilary and probably Bernie too.  Many, many people will begrudgingly vote for trump to avoid voting for a candidate that is too liberal.    I know warren is a Reddit darling and I‚Äôm sure she is easily a better choice than trump, but her chances of winning based on her far left politics will put her behind the 8ball.
I bet she ... wait for it... **plans** on you campaigning!  Ahahaha. I‚Äôll see myself out.
It's not really "Warren supporters" who wouldn't vote for Bernie. Warren supporters would absolutely vote for him.  The difference is that more moderate Democrats would vote for Warren versus Bernie. Why? Well, lol, because Warren is more moderate than Bernie -- because Warren is a Democrat and Bernie isn't.  This has always been the problem with Bernie as a general election candidate -- compared to the best other Democratic candidates, he's not as likely as other candidates to get support from over half of voters.  So your blame is not on Warren supporters but rather, it's just political reality that many moderates aren't going to vote for Bernie's policies.  Hardcore Bernie supporters have made the mistake of interpreting his popularity as an outsider as a reflection of how he would perform as an actual general election presidential candidate. I'm not saying he couldn't win, but once he's a general election candidate he would face tremendous pushback from people fearful that he's going to bring socialism to the US.
Not true, Bernie is a close second choice for me. If a Warren voter cares about policy, then Bernie is the obvious other choice. No one else comes closes. I love my progressive grandma and grandad.
Tired, man. You?
Yeah, Biden is looking a lot like Hillary here, and it is worth remembering Hillary so as not to repeat mistakes.  To me, a lot of this is about recognizing the difference between a politician/leader who is maybe good for a certain role (like Senator, Congressman, Vice President), but not good for the role of President.  Hillary was a good Senator, I think, because she was in New York, it's a Democratic-leaning state, she was widely respected there, and so there wasn't this massive campaign of dredging up all of the most negative things about the Clintons and then combining that with disinformation. But all of that happened when she became a national candidate and she came with so much negative baggage and so much time in the national spotlight, and it was so easy to link her real history of being a mostly successful public official to a lot of disinformation (Clintons are murderers, Hillary is evil, Hillary is an extreme liberal and/or Hillary is way too conservative, Hillary's adviser runs a child prostitution ring, Hillary illegally traded uranium with Russia, Hillary caused Benghazi). It was just too easy to exploit American ignorance to erode Hillary's support.  With Biden, he similarly was a good Senator in a Democratic-leaning state and then he was a respected Vice President because Vice Presidents don't have to take the spotlight too much. But he also has this long history of public service where he made some bad votes and was a bit creepy and it will be easy to emphasize and exaggerate his faults to the extreme.  Liz Warren has negatives with the Native American ancestry stuff, but I actually think she has done a good job of addressing and apologizing for that stuff and see it as a minor mistake on her part. And I think most importantly, more than any other candidate she is about something and her politics fit this moment. Biden's politics just don't fit this moment. He's too centrist and he comes off as out of touch.  To make sure we beat the Republicans/Trump (not just the presidency, but the Senate), we need a nominee who is going to inspire young people to vote in historically high numbers. Liz Warren's plans can do that. Biden won't inspire young people to vote in historically high numbers.
Presidents can request that legislative members introduce certain bills
Thank you!
It's literally true. It's not a bad thing, in fact it's a good way of showing online support for your candidate. But Sanders supporters do have coordinated efforts to vote in online polls, that's just reality.
Hillary was too liberal?? People didn‚Äôt like Hillary for many reasons. That was not one of them.   What you are arguing is everyone‚Äôs first impression. And then they look at her policies and listen to her story. She‚Äôs progressive, sure, but her policies are more populist than everything else.   Trump was too liberal too - and no one cared because he was a (dishonest fear-mongering) populist - go back and watch is rallies - ‚Äúthese Wall Street bankers are robbing you‚Äù etc. And everyone doubted him from day one but it worked.  Most don‚Äôt care much about policies anyway, unfortunately - they want someone to fight wealthy corporatists for them and Trump has betrayed them and Warren has picked up the mantle.   Honestly, again, what you‚Äôre arguing is everyone‚Äôs initial argument (heard it many times and can give examples) and then they convert.
> So your blame is not on Warren supporters but rather  I wasn't trying to assign blame, just making an observation that's supported by polling data. Warren's closest rival in terms of policy is Bernie, and it isn't even close. Yet Harris and Pete are the second choices for Warren voters, with Bernie falling well behind both of those two. Even in this MoveOn poll, Bernie is the second choice for only 11% of respondents. So, even if ALL of that 11% came from just Warren supporters (obviously it didn't) that would still mean that less than 1/3 of Warren supporters have Bernie as the second choice.   Anecdotally, there are a ton of Warren supporters that I've seen say that they fucking despise Sanders. I haven't seen any Sanders supporters saying the same thing about Liz. I've seen some saying dumb stuff like Warren is a corporate shill, etc., but even those people think she's among the top choices.   But, when it comes to the general election, it doesn't really matter if a lot of Dems hate Bernie but decide he's better than Trump. What matters is how many Dems hate Bernie so much that they'd stay home or vote for Trump or Schultz. I think that number is small. People have (correctly, IMO) said that they think his outsider status will help him in the general election because that's what the polling says. Compared to the other candidates, he does very well with independent/swing voters, and demographics (young and very liberal) that don't show up to vote very often. That's what wins elections.
This argument never made sense to me. All the polls currently show Biden and Sanders with better numbers vs Trump than Warren. In 2016, Sanders did significantly better with independents than Clinton did, even though he was uber progressive. On top of that, he's most competitive in rust belt, where Trump has basically the only pathway to reelection. Sanders is significantly more popular with actual moderates and independents, just not democratic party's moderates...  The blame is absolutely on Warren voters, because her voters are not Sanders voters to a large degree. If you look at Biden second choice, it's Bernie. If you look at Bernie's, it's Biden, though recently that started to shift more to Warren. So who does Warren take votes from? Kamala/Beto/Pete. Former Clinton voters who will only vote for woman. Neoliberals, Yuppies, white collar workers as opposed to blue collar that Biden/Sanders compete over.
> If a Warren voter cares about policy, then Bernie is the obvious other choice. No one else comes closes.  Agreed, only I have Bernie ahead of Liz. Liz is my #2 and there is a mile between her and the next person on my list.
Fired up
No, brigading is a bad thing. It's against the spirit of online polls and surveys. And it's not really true to single out Sanders supporters. Sanders supporters don't do it any more than others. Which is to say, not that often.  It's yet another facet of the "Bernie Bro" slander that's been happening since 2015. Essentially portraying Sanders supporters as rude and unruly and childish.
Hilary was pushed to the left by Bernie‚Äôs success in the primaries and put her in a place where she was uncomfortable.   And if you think for a second that people who voted for trump are aware of some quote he made about Wall Street, you are overestimating them.
>I haven't seen any Sanders supporters say the same about Liz.  Lol head over to WayOfTheBern and you will, their stickied post is almost always something trashing Warren nowadays. I think though the average Sanders supporter isn't likely to dislike Warren, and I agree that the average Warren supporter may be more prone to dislike Sanders (full disclosure: I fall into the latter group).   This is because Warren is pulling in almost equal parts from both Clinton and Sanders 2016 coalitions, as evidenced by the fact the Sanders and Harris are both tied as the top second choice for Warren supporters. It's a sign of a strong candidate though to unite voters with pretty different viewpoints and across ideologies.
But if you look deeper at the polls, Warren is the only one gaining ground over the last few months, and then she is ahead of all candidates as a second or third choice among voters. Bernie is second as a first choice candidate but does not poll well as a second, third, or fourth choice.  That means that if voters abandon Biden, it's more likely to be Warren than Bernie that they choose.  >"Former Clinton voters will only voted for women."  Lol, really dude? She got like 60 million votes in 2016, the majority of votes. Plenty of her supporters are voting for Biden.
Biden and Sanders are more known nationally than Warren. It's similar to how Hillary had a huge lead in 2016 before any debates -- because so few people knew the other candidates. Bernie eventually emerged after debate season started.  Once we have a few debates this year, candidates like Warren and others will get more attention and then the polls will reflect more how people can review the actual candidates and not just support who they know.  My prediction is that Elizabeth Warren will be in the lead by October.
Go to literally any dailykos straw polls and you'll know that isn't the truth
Have you been to /r/WayOfTheBern?
Right, you said she was pushed to the left by Bernie. But again, she was historically unpopular (as was Trump) for many reasons. And this is the first time i‚Äôve heard that it was because she was too liberal. As for people voting for Trump because of what he said at his rallies - I‚Äôm a bit confused - you think the people who supported him and went to his rallies and voted for him...didn‚Äôt know what he was saying at his rallies?
As I said above, the latest polling I've seen shows that the second choice for Warren voters is NOT Bernie. He's in a distant third behind Harris and Pete (both about the same).  https://twitter.com/_waleedshahid/status/1143538459287666689  Warren has gained in the polls recently, but her gains have NOT come at the expense of Bernie.   https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign-polls/450182-warren-support-rises-in-two-national-polls  Yes, I conceded that you can find some Bernie supporters trashing Warren (especially at the sub you mentioned). But even on that sub, which is probably the rudest you can find anywhere, a lot of the scorn towards Warren is of the "she's a diet version of Bernie" variety. You'll see people saying that Tulsi is better than her, but I haven't seen anyone (even there) saying that Warren isn't much much better than Biden and the rest of the candidates not named Tulsi or Bernie.  Contrast that to the many Warren supporters that have Bernie at the absolute bottom of their list. Like you said, a lot of Warren's support comes from Hillary primary voters, and those people aren't really picking Warren based on policy/ideology.
She's not the only one, Pete surged as well.   I don't know what polls you're looking at, the one's i've seen 2 weeks back to 2 months back all showed Biden's second choice was Sanders, not Warren. Biden is basically flat over the last couple of months, Sanders maybe a couple of points down. Warren gained at the expense of Kamala/Beto, couple of points from Bernie (though he also gained a couple of points these past couple of weeks) and couple of points from Biden. Also, seems like she stopped Pete surge.   You don't think that significant bloc of Warren's voters support because she could be the first female president? I've seen plenty of comments of people saying in this very subreddit they will not vote for a white old male. Just like HRC had plenty of people voting against her because she was a woman, she also had many who voted because of that glass ceiling. Google PUMAs. And it seems antimale/pro woman vote this time is coalescing around Warren, since Kamala is not gaining any traction. Democratic voter base is like 65%+ women? Even a small part of that is big enough voting bloc, unless you somehow think women are above identity politics?
I would imagine the people at rallies represent a fraction of a percent of voters for a candidate.  The vast majority of people who voted for trump were never aware of statements like that.
> As I said above, the latest polling I've seen shows that the second choice for Warren voters is NOT Bernie.   Morning Consult has Bernie -> Biden (34%) as much more common than Bernie -> Warren (21%), and Warren -> Bernie being tied with Warren -> Harris (21% each):  https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/  That's been consistent for a while now.  > You'll see people saying that Tulsi is better than her, but I haven't seen anyone (even there) saying that Warren isn't much much better than Biden and the rest of the candidates not named Tulsi or Bernie.  a) As someone from Hawaii who's followed her actions since before she stuck up for Bernie, calling Tulsi a progressive is a seriously bad take, especially if you're going to try to create a purity test to separate Warren and Bernie.  b) WayOfTheBern is home of the busters and at some points has had more articles trashing Warren on their front page than articles about Bernie.  It's honestly hard to see how someone who posts there can say that they think the sub just prefers Bernie but also like Warren.  Assuming you are posting in good faith, please consider avoiding that sub as it is at best a home to toxicity and very likely being actively manipulated by bad actors.  https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/c1ex6j/warren_is_supported_by_third_way_cap_the_neocons/  https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/c32pe3/warren_a_solid_compromise_candidate/  https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/byffis/its_tulsi_gabbard_bernie_sanders_or_bust/  > Like you said, a lot of Warren's support comes from Hillary primary voters, and those people aren't really picking Warren based on policy/ideology.  I think they are choosing on policy (among everyone else), but Bernie has turned them off.  It's not like Warren isn't also competing with Pete, Harris, and Biden for their votes.  They're choosing Warren because they like her policies, even while they can't see Sanders as an effective leader.
Elizabeth Warren pledges not to appoint wealthy donors to ambassador positions in sweeping reform of State Department
Liz is my hero
I think that pledge is only useful if the person isn‚Äôt qualified.  I knew an ambassador to an African Country.  He was a significant donor to a presidential campaign.  He also had lived in the country in question for years and spoke the languages that the citizens of that country spoke.  He was a big donor but he was also qualified for that job.  I have zero issues with big donors who are similarly qualified.
Well, shit. Why am I even donating $10 a month?
How about putting people in those positions that are well educated about the countries they would serve as ambassadors for?
US diplomats accept the sinecure ambassadors, and sometimes even warm to them. But across the boards, we'd prefer career foreign service to fill those vacancies.  source: was US diplomat, hence the username!
Reform? You mean rebuild.
To everyone getting upset for no reason, the headline is just one aspect of the sweeping State Department reforms she's proposing.   Besides, would you rather the United States Ambassador to some of America's top allies be someone who is an expert in the ins and outs of that country, who speaks the major languages used, who knows how to work with our top level staff there, who can handle a crisis in the country, who deeply understands and can represent the views of the Warren administration and the US State department to the government there, or would you rather someone who donated a lot of money buy the job?  This is just another aspect of the corruption in America we've all grown numb to.
So, if someone like Angelina Jolie wanted to be ambassador for Laos would she would automatically be rejected? Or Oprah Winfrey? Or is it more about having a candidate with decades of international relations experience? Even then, a persons personal success should not be a factor?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, ambassadors ‚â† cabinet roles. If this was a cabinet position, I'd be down with this rule. B/c those people are more engaged in policy decisions.
Making this pledge about cabinet positions would carry much more weight.  This comes across as a ‚Äústay in the headlines‚Äù bit of news.  Warren is currently my choice but I‚Äôm not influenced by this news.
Eh, that's kinda how ambassadorships have always worked. A potted plant could serve as our ambassador in London, because the state department has hundreds of career employees talking with hundreds of their counterparts in the UK pretty much constantly, as do our armed forces and intelligence agencies, etc.  Edit: to -> in
Under the Warren administration, ambassadors will be required to give free selfies to anyone that wants one; not just at fancy state dinners.
This is one of the biggest holdovers from the political spoils era, most other government positions were professionalized but we should be aware that other countries see some of our ambassadors as jokes and the state department has lost a lot of good people because the culmination of a career in foreign service is usually NOT as an ambassador, someone who is expert at representing the US for an entire career and knows how the state department works
Umm, thanks, I guess. I love Warren, but thats the baseline. Is this an extreme position now?
I get where you're coming from but I  think the problem is that many wealthy donors are offered ambassadorships in exchange for financial support, which is nothing short of bribery. There are plenty of qualified people out there, I don't really feel all that bad for the rich donors.
I don't think living in the country and speaking the language is enough to qualify for a major foreign service position.
Yeah but surely there are equally qualified people that AREN'T big donors.
I think it's also a little bit 'stretchy' and a bit inconsistent.  Ultimately, in most embassies, the Ambassador is the representative - where representative is key. The majority of serious work gets done by working level folks and the Ambassadors are the movers and shakers. To that end, I think it's a bit disgenuous on how this article characterises how some previous administrations have done this. Yes, Obama appointed some big time bundlers (not just straight big donors like the current administration) and certainly yes that is some favour - but they're typically assigned to 'easier' countries in Western Europe or small countries where the bulk of their job will just be making public speeches or visiting schools or making key friends, which is what those bundlers tend to be good at. Obviously key embassies or conflict areas are going to require more subject matter experts.  I think it's a nice gesture on Warren's part here but, especially with how her fundraising strategy is structured against big donors anyway, it is mostly a given.
There is a conflict of interest these people don‚Äôt bribe their way into these positions because they want to help people. They are going to abuse the position to enrich themselves.
Shouldn't Ambassadors of the United States of America be the most qualified person, not whoever donated the most?  Imagine a crisis in another country, wouldn't you want the ambassador to be able to work in sync with the state department, giving their expert knowledge of the ins and outs of that country? Some US ambassadors to America's allies, have no experience in the country, don't speak the major languages spoken there but gave lots of money to the winning candidate.
Did Obama ever appoint a cabinet position based on donations? I would imagine the Trump administration to be an outlier.
In that case we shouldn't be paying a salary to someone who's job isn't essential. I'm definitely not ok with it.
Yup. This would only make sense for places that don't need lavish parties. But ambassadors most of the time just meet people in those country and host dinners and build relationships. (The embassy does other work obv).
Ambassador to London?
Considering Obama used to give bundlers these positions, yes it is.
Exactly. If they‚Äôre qualified, they shouldn‚Äôt need to purchase the position in the first place. If a wealthy philanthropist wants an ambassadorship, they should tailor their philanthropy to proving their qualifications for that position, not shell out for the ambassador tier on Candidate X‚Äôs Kickstarter.
You don‚Äôt think having an idea about the local politics, knowing the key players in government and being able to speak to almost anyone living there would be a helpful skill set for an ambassador?
Why should anything matter other than qualifications?
It feels really weird to me that you are giving obama a pass on rewarding campaign donations with appointments to desirable jobs. To me that seems extremely corrupt and definitely something that everyone should pledge not to do.
in certain areas yes, but many ambassadorships in places like London is just wining and dinning
in*
Mostly they are going to big bundlers and mega donors. It's not like some affluent Warren supporter with a diplomatic background who gives the hard money max of l $4600 is going to be disqualified
Those thing are important, but only in addition to actual experience in foreign policy.   One of my cousins was a deputy ambassador. He had a degree in [Region] Studies and a graduate degree in international relations. He also had 30 years experience in the State Department, including 20 years working as a political officer in the country. He was also fluent in the language.   Those are the qualifications ambassadors should have.
It‚Äôs helpful but it‚Äôs a lot less helpful than having actual foreign policy experience and a clear history of job performance in diplomacy.
Maybe just a difference of terminology. I'm looking at it as qualifications and disqualifications, you should have the first but none of the latter. But if you want, you can frame "lack of DQs" as a qualification, and then claim that "only qualifications matter", in which case I'd agree with you.
Political appointments should be ethical in both fact and appearance. A big donor getting a position is never going to appear ethical. It will always appear like a bribe, Warren is making the right call her. Time to end moneys influence on politics
Really you don't think it might be helpful to have an ambassador in London who is an expert on the history of the UK and the EU, and the UK relations with Ireland given the border with Northern Ireland. Who knows what President Warren would want in a future trade agreement with an independent UK, maybe they should be someone who can pick all of that up quickly and have a good rapport with the President. Also even wining and dining important people on behalf of the United States is important for our diplomatic relations in all of this.
For Trump, his ambassadors gave million dollar donations to his inauguration. There is less oversight and the SDNY was investigating to see if Trump was laundering money with that fund. Barr stopped the investigation from continuing. I'm hoping Congress gets a better look, but given how hard it is to just get his NY state taxes, I don't know when we would know.
I think those things only matter when you are either working as an ambassador to a key ally eg the UK, with nations we do not have great relationships with but are important eg Russia in 1993, or are nations with a small staff.  This guy was in an African nation that we had ok relationships with but didn‚Äôt have much to offer at the time so the need for diplomacy was minimal.  Merely knowing the leaders as personal acquaintances/friends seemed to be enough as we were never going to be negotiating anything difficult with them at that time.
Disqualifications are things that would prevent you from getting a security clearance.  Being able to get a security clearance should be required fir all sensitive positions.
Note:  >Really you don't think it might be helpful to have an ambassador in London who is an expert on the history of the UK and the EU, and the UK relations with Ireland given the border with Northern Ireland  sets up a false dilemma fallacy, you can have both.  Either you're reading my comments wrong or implying I said something I never said.
Then to get at your original point, I view it as a qualification to not be a big donor.
I'm saying we should have people who are in ambassadors because they bought the job, instead we should be looking at their abilities to do the job alone
My point was that their income and donations shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with becoming or not becoming an ambassador.  Most ambassador‚Äôs actual jobs do not require a background in diplomacy because the relationship with the nation they are in isn‚Äôt changing nor are there treaties to be handled so merely having expert knowledge of that nation is enough.
At least be able to speak the language or know anything of substance about the country. Watching Trump's picks trying to answer basic Senate questions was cringe worthy.
Of course it does. Large donations create the possibility of conflicts of interest. You're looking too narrowly at the explicit job requirements.
There can be conflicts of interest even without donations so I do not see how it logically should rule someone out.
Juli√°n Castro endorses Warren for President!
It sounds like if she wins, it's Warren/Castro. I'm shocked, but pleasantly surprised, he endorsed so early.
this is the best team-up of this primary cycle. Glad to see an endorsement from someone who ran a campaign on uplifting forgotten American voices!
Sitting next to my husband wishing that some of the early dropouts would make endorsements before the voting begins and bam!   Happy to see this one for sure.
This makes me so happy!
i'm glad someone had the courage to endorse now! (out of the ex candidates).
Just watched the joint video on twitter and am so happy! He was my #2 choice so it's really nice to see them teaming up together.
I wish he was still in the race, but this is awesome!
Warren/Castro!!! I hope de Blasio and Jay Inslee endorse in the near future. Media desperately wants to end Warren's campaign and she needs some help to fight back.
You da real mvp.  Excuse me, that should be "vp".
This endorsement means so much to me.
This is so exciting! This is a duo for the ages. Can‚Äôt get over how excited I am
Someone tell me I'm an idiot if I'm wrong, but isn't this the first candidate for nominee that's endorsed?
Makes me so happy!!!!
hell ya! my two favorites!
Doesn't surprise me; he's been very vocally supportive of Warren for a while, even as a candidate himself. His endorsement is very much welcomed though!
I'm not home alone, so I'm quietly screaming with joy!!!
This is awesome! Although, not completely unexpected. I saw them together at the Polk County Steak fry and they looked really close then.
Not a huge shocker, he's an ideal candidate for her VP slot. But I'm surprised it came so early.
AMAZING!
What I like the most is that she is providing a voice and adopting some of the ideas of these candidates that were not able to get much traction in the primary. She is telling them that what they did and what they stand for is important and she wants to continue to take it forward.
Great I thought they had something in common üòä
You love to see it
I'm thrilled!
Ngl, this is huge. I've been bouncing back between Yang, Sanders, and Warren. This is a fantastic endorsement and really makes this a neck and neck race for me. I can't believe I'm still this undecided this late into the race. I'm really glad I don't vote in Iowa because I don't know how I'd make that decision. I'm hoping by the time my state comes up, the choice will be more apparent for me. Although if it isn't, maybe that's not a bad thing.

The comments. I'm sick of them.
A high profile endorsement is always good news, however the poll numbers are not good news. Warren's team needs to focus on ad buys, and preparing for a great debate performance in January!
Makes perfect sense, though I doubt it will have any significant impact on the race.
Love this potential combo
This is the dream ticket!
*Juli√°n Castro endorses himself to be Warren's running mate*
But what about Warren/Harris?!?!?

Is it possible that he‚Äôs just endorsing her for the hope of a VP pick? Warren needs a black person from the south imo. Castro as VP wouldnt really help her
That would be a rad ticket!
This has always been my favorite pairing!
Not a certainty but certainly a possibility
Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt try to sway her away from M4A, as he is against it.
Idk, I‚Äôve been seeing some hints of Warren Yang
I really like Castro to be anyone's VP.  I donated to keep him in the debates. I think a Warren Castro ticket would be best.
Bernie/AOC disagrees.
I mean if you are Harris and want to endorse, who do you endorse? I doubt it‚Äôs Bernie, or Pete. Maybe Biden but she attacked him already pretty badly...
I was Hoping Kamala would but I'm assuming her asking price was too high.
It's more calculation than courage. Castro had to get in before Booker (assuming the polls are correct and Booker's departure is imminent).
...and am reading the comments and find it interesting that Bernie supporters are both attacking him and at the same time claiming his supporters were too few to make a difference. I supported Bernie in 2016 but there's something really ugly about his campaign this time and it's a complete turn-off.
Agreed, it's sad that qualified candidates are dropping out while inexperienced candidates stay afloat.
Didn't Inslee already endorse her when she adopted his climate change plan?
Great question.¬†There have only been a few minor endorsements from candidates who dropped out so far ‚Äì¬†none of the big ones. [This section on the wiki page lists who the dropouts have endorsed if anyone.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Withdrew_before_the_primaries)   Mike Gravel has endorsed "Gabbard and Sanders"  John Hickenlooper has endorsed Michael Bennet  Tim Ryan has endorsed Joe Biden  And now Juli√°n Castro has endorsed Elizabeth Warren  I think/hope Warren has a chance at getting the endorsements of Inslee, Harris, O'Rourke, and Gillibrand. I don't know whether any of them will endorse before there's a clear leader, though. We'll see!
[deleted]
Mike Gravel dropped out and endorsed Bernie last August, though one could argue that the primary hadn't really begun yet.  EDIT: Also, Tim Ryan dropped out and endorsed Biden.
Sure is! If she could get Kamala's heading into Cali, what a boost that could be.
Inslee is the closest
Tim Ryan endorsed Biden.
Can we collectively agree that just because a former 2020 Democratic candidate endorses another, it isn't simply, or primarily, because they're angling for VP or some other cabinet position? They could be sincere about what they're saying!
it‚Äôs good optics to ingratiate dropout candidates ideas into your campaign, but its also suspect from an ideological standpoint. castro and harris are at odds in terms of policy. castro, admirably, put forth one of the most, if not the most, comprehensive criminal justice reform plans . that he deserves credit for. on the other hamd, kamala was attorney general of California; in that role she carried forth some of the most punitive criminal justice policies seen in the US.   its hard to sqaure. i give warren credit for teaming up with castro.  that credit is lost with her praise and support of kamala. liz warren is great, but needs to sharpen her PR skills. or just be consistent.
Having 3 options is pretty great! I'm so late that I'm going to have to pick between whoever the top two candidates are but plan to canvass in a Super Tuesday state at least.
Why are you bouncing back and forth? What draws you to each candidate? I can guess of course, but I'd like to gauge what your priorities are and where you're coming from in terms of how you feel each candidate can effectively deal with them.
Removed for Rule 1 (Trolling)
He attacked Biden and fell to the same fate as Kamala.
I don't know if that's necessarily true. Black voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, and might support whoever the nominee is. Castro could help energize the Hispanic demographic, if the nominee feels that's more valuable.   Edit: it's definitely uncomfortable to talk about demographics this way, but unfortunately it's a big factor.
Yeah, that's probably more likely. I think he could be okay, but it's not like he has a huge latinx following anyway. They have great chemistry though, but then again, Warren has great chemistry with a lot of people since she's a warm person.
He would, though.
I'm going to go out on limb and guess you, yourself, are *not* a "black person from the south".
>Warren needs a black person from the south imo  to win the south? If Warren/Castro could win back wi/pa/mi then they could lose florida and still win, regular south doesn't even matter*   *more reason why we need to eliminate the electoral college
>Warren needs a black person  Black voters don't automatically vote for black candidates. Just look at Biden vs Kamala. Like a lot of minority voters, they tend to vote strategically in primaries, looking for the candidate that's mostly likely to win while still representing their interests.   I think that signifying the Democratic party's faith in diversity and coalitions is more important that which particular Person of Color makes it onto the top two slots. I do think there must and will be a PoC in the vp slot, now that it looks near certain a white person will win (sorry Booker!). And if the top slot is a man, the vp will be a woman.   I don't think Warren would feel compelled to pick a man though. So I wouldn't be surprised by Warren/Abrams
Andrew Gillam perhaps. Help her win FL. I don't have a problem with Castro, but I prefer a safe approach. Winning TX would be awesome, but losing FL and TX really, really bad.
This is what I was thinking. No way would the other major candidates select Castro as VP.
I would find this ticket very appealing. I always liked Castro and it was disappointing that he never got to show off like how he deserved to. Anyway, I'm thankful for his endorsement.
I would be beyond astounded if that ever happened.
I would be surprised if that happened.
I'm honestly not sure why this is getting so downvoted.  Warren and Yang seem to have a great relationship and not incompatible messages and approach to problem solving.  I wouldn't put him as a super likely because there are a lot of good options, but as far as candidate chemistry and potential to merge messages, Yang seems like a real possibility.  (I do think Castro fits that bill much better though.)
Didn‚Äôt she essentially say that it‚Äôs fiction that automation is taking away jobs?
If anything could ruin my support for Warren, that would be it.
I did the same. I thought his voice was super necessary in the primary and I'm sad that he dropped out sooner than I wanted but if it means that he's an advocate for the Warren campaign for the rest of the primary (at least) then I can't complain! I really do hope to vote for a Warren/Castro ticket in November as well.
I mean... I LOVE and respect AOC for sure
I feel like Harris is waiting until some of the early primary states to gauge Warren‚Äôs momentum, but I could absolutely imagine her endorsing Warren. Same with O‚ÄôRourke, Gillibrand, and Inslee.
Kamala doesn't fit on the ticket with anyone, she wants to run the show. She's like the black version of Hillary.  Doesn't stop me from hoping she'll endorse Warren or Sanders, I would be pleasantly surprised. She's probably more aligned with Biden or Buttigieg.
Why would Castro have to endorse before Booker drops out?
Castro and Warren are good friends and are closely aligned politically, he would have endorsed her regardless of any political ambitions.
Response from Pete camp has been... interesting. They really don't like Castro.
There have been bad actors masquerading as Bernie supporters since 2016. There is a lot of pro-Bernie propaganda intended only to divide Democrats.
It's not usually the campaign itself (other than some surrogates like Nina Turner). I do, however, dock them for still failing to reign in the assholes, and it's one of the reasons he is not my first choice this time.
Bernies campaign is still pretty mad about various tinfoil and real problems with the 2016 campaign and the DNC  it's still interesting to me that generally speaking the result is the same ride or die 20-25%   it'll be a interesting thing to watch as different groups peel off and suspend campaigns
In my opinion there is a sincere effort from dark forces on the right to seed distrust among Bernie supporters. It‚Äôs why you see so much vitriol online against any other candidate. The point is to convince enough unknowing people that everyone except Bernie is a liar and to splinter the party and deny votes in the general from anyone that‚Äôs isn‚Äôt Bernie.   In fact, I‚Äôm quite certain that is what‚Äôs happening.
It was ugly in 2016 too. I was told that I was a "low information voter" and "voting against my interests as a black person" because I was considering voting for Hillary
I could see Inslee or Gillibrand endorsing her. There's enough issue synergy and also those two are pretty well out of contention for the VP position. I doubt either one would be a game-changer, but it would still be nice.  O' Rourke I see as unlikely to endorse. It's hard to imagine a world where she picks him for VP over Castro. He seems more likely to endorse Biden, though I don't think Biden will pick a white guy for his VP either.  Harris is truly the wildcard. IMO she is too attractive as a VP candidate - as she is now the most visible woman of color in Democratic politics outside Michelle Obama - to make an endorsement now. It would be a really bold play for her to bank on Warren wanting an all female ticket, and she probably has an equal or better chance of getting AG (if she wants it) under a Biden administration. My guess is she will wait. Maybe endorse Warren if and only if Warren opens up an early lead.  Sadly, I imagine that most likely scenario for some of these endorsements is that if Bernie starts pummeling Biden, they will close the circle around Biden and try to block a Bernie nomination.
I'm holding out hope that Inslee is Warren's VP pick.  Castro endorsing this early must mean he was promised a sweet cabinet gig.  Maybe SoS
Oh man, even if you call Gravel a technicality, I'm totally wrong.  Tim Ryan endorsed Biden  Hickenlooper endorsed Bennett
And Gillibrand before NY.
Why would Kamala endorse Warren?  And I don't know how many in CA would view this as favorably.  When she dropped out her CA specific polls were dropping rapidly
Sooo did i think..moulton. but he never made a debate so did he actually run?
Exactly. Castro was a strong progressive voice and a lot of his policies lined up well with Warren's. It makes sense he'd want the person whose views sync up best with his own to be president.
It would only be hard to square if she was adopting their entire platform. She is not. She has been consistent in her approach of ‚ÄúLet the best ideas survive‚Äù. She isn‚Äôt too proud to stick to unworkable positions. She‚Äôs adaptable. If something BETTER comes along that helps the American people with the data to back it up, she doesn‚Äôt double down on the worse position. She adopts the better position. She knows how to move the football. My concern with Bernie would be that he may paralyzed by his own ideology to be an effective president. To continue with the football analogy, his ideology may force him to make bizarre decisions like always going for it on 4th and 10, or always punting on 4th and 1. As president, you have to know what is achievable. If a ‚Äúhalf-measure‚Äù approach to solve a big problem hits his desk, what is he going to do? Will he sign it? Or will he push for something that may never even hit his desk? I‚Äôm concerned he will get nothing done by doubling down on potentially unworkable positions because his ideology dictates it. Warren knows how to move the football.
I mean, I supported Sanders in 2016, but then I thought it would be great to have a female president who supported a lot of his policies. And I was really worried about Sanders after his heart attack, and thought he should drop out. But this his next debate performance was amazing, and he got the critical AOC endorsement. And then Warren released her plan, which, while a lot of people in the Sanders circle criticizes for being too soft, I appreciate that she really looked at the roadmap of how to get there and created a realistic solution. But then I also really preferred Sanders' response to the Iran assassination over Warren. Meanwhile, Castro has been the only candidate that has addressed trans people unprompted on the debate stage and that really meant a lot to me. I feel like in another race, he would totally be my number one. So his endorsement means so much to me. And then Yang is doing his own thing, and I love all of his policies that I feel like other candidates aren't exploring. He comes from such a different field and I appreciate that varied experience (although I definitely worry about his lack of experience when it comes to foreign affairs.) So yeah, I love all three candidates and would be happy with any of them. I see the tension rising between the camps as the race starts to come to a head, but I've decided to really make sure I don't let supporters color my views of the candidates. I really don't want Biden; I'd vote Buttigeig over him.... but like, I don't want Pete either. He really is Biden lite.
Is anyone else disgusted that people are picked based on their ability to energize different demographics than by what they believe in? Not an attack on you, /u/ezrs158, but the system in general.
The problem isn't the ratio of Democratic picks to Republican picks - as you point out, Black Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic in that regard. The problem is the ratio of people who vote to people who don't vote. That ratio was much higher with Obama in 2008 and 2012 with Black Americans, and also young people.
This election cycle will be [the first one where Hispanic voters actually outnumber black voters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/first-time-latinos-be-largest-non-white-share-eligible-voters-n964571). So Castro could do her a lot of good by energizing voters in the Southwest, possibly even helping her flip Texas.
But if you pick someone like Abrams, you energize a large base of otherwise non-voters to hit the polls in a battleground state
Hi Reddit! It‚Äôs the Warren for President campaign.
You‚Äôre amazing! I‚Äôm currently working hard in Kentucky to elect a Democratic Governor, but after November I will get to work helping you win (on top of helping MITCH lose!) Thanks for making a teenager from Kentucky care so much ‚ù§Ô∏è.
Aw hype the official campaign noticed us here on reddit. This has inspired me to donate 25 more dollars to the campaign tonight.
Elizabeth Warren AMA when?
Some of your meet and greet events are on Facebook, but not on https://events.elizabethwarren.com  Please fix this! A lot of people are not on Facebook. Your San Diego event wasn't there, for instance.
We're not doing nearly as much as you guys are. Keep it up!
Thanks for all the work your campaign is doing, it‚Äôs making a difference and there is a noticeable groundswell.
I'm a Warren fan and business owner in the oil and gas industry in a community that relies on that industry. I have questions for Elizabeth because our entire community, and we as owners/employers, have real anxiety about what lies ahead not only for the environment, but also for our business and the families we support. Not everyone in oil and gas is evil and corrupt.  I'm frustrated that I don't know where to write to be sure Mrs. Warren hears my questions. Advice?
Keep up the great work! I hope to see you guys take a more pro-active and civil way of pushing back against smears and lies about Warren and her record from the right and some very loud elements of the left.
Wow! What ‚Äúbig structural changes‚Äù are most important to her?
When she's president can you make official "W: The President" stickers? I need one...for...Schadenfruede.
Can't wait to get out and collect signatures tomorrow for Warren here in Chicago! If my schedule had the time I would love to go knock on doors in Iowa!
when will you do AMAs

I don't think it's a great idea right now. There are far too many bad faith actors on this site. You'll end up with questions based on false premises upvoted to the top, drowning out anyone genuinely interested in asking a legitimate question. It'll either serve mainly as a magnet for trolls, or be locked in a well moderated sub like this one where she's basically preaching to the choir.
What question would you ask?
This! I'd never sign up to Facebook, and it's time to actively boycott that site. Allowing blatant lies in political ads is enough.
Also, I really want to have an event near Boston! I've seen 2 candidates but not my hometown senator!!!
You know we can FIX that problem.  Reddit is an organizing tool dammit.  Let‚Äôs use it.
How will choosing Sanders as a vice unify the party? That is actually the most tone deaf thing to do. The vice has to be a more conservative or moderate and popular Democrat.   Sanders supporters have also been hostile to Warren lately.  and believe it or not, most of the party is moderate.
It‚Äôd alienate the moderates. I adore Bernie, but having him as VP would not be good strategy, imo. I think Bernie, should he get the nomination, would be wise to have Warren be VP... but I don‚Äôt see Bernie getting the nomination.
The idea that something needs to be done to "unify the party" between Warren and Sanders while ignoring that most of the party isn't progressive is why people lose their minds on social media.  The left isn't the party and we need to get over these trivial differences if we want to have any hope of taking control of the actual party.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I think the KY State Party is doing better than the national party lol.
AMAs are kind of overrated anyways.
She was a professor- I think she would do well. She‚Äôs been answering questions for decades in a classroom.
Oh boy. Probably just be full of questions like "what is your favorite kind of teepee".
What, specifically, will you do to fight ongoing Russian aggression abroad and at home?
does she think her protectionism isn't too much? or will she change some of her manifesto if she makes it to the general
She often does events in southern NH, the drive is around an hour long
I get the sentiment here, but the campaign has its own digital organizing tool in All-In for Warren, and I highly suggest you use it! They do at least a bit of vetting, so it's less susceptible to trolling, and it's where I get most of my info on volunteer opportunities.
[deleted]
The only reason I'd agree that Bernie/Warren makes any sense is because his VP has such a high chance of becoming president.  Warren has the luxury of selecting a candidate that can pull in a particular demographic or state and/or building the profile of an up and coming successor.
I am a moderate...the rest are shit. the dems in general, especially on gun talk, are doing a damn fine job of alienating the middle--especially Bernie whom I like.
This post is being removed for violating Rule 4: Dividing Democrats. Suggesting not voting in the general because a ticket isn't ideal is part of what resulted in Trump in 2016.
you know that moderates are the biggest faction in the Democratic party right? and no what a lot of studies suggest is that Hilary was just an unlikable candidate plus the effect of Obama-Trump voters.  Why is Biden winning by a huge margin in states that Bernie had previously won over Hilary? There's a theory that some supported Bernie because they just didn't like Hilary.

[deleted]
Yep‚Äîand the risk/reward is wrong. An AMA in the warren sub isn‚Äôt going to change minds in the right direction.
You‚Äôve got a point there. As much as I‚Äôd love an AMA, it would be a troll magnet. Maybe somebody like Roger Lau or someone else working on the campaign could do one.
Although Warren is a goddamn debate genius, she'd probably respond with something about affordable housing for Native Americans.
This is my understanding, and if any economists are here, feel free to correct me:  As far as I can tell, the EP plan and her trade plan are not exactly the same. The EP plan is about creating incentives for companies to keep workers at home while trade plan is about fair treatment abroad. Even with new standards, multi-national corporations will still want to do foreign trade in these regions and there will be a higher incentive compared to China because of the higher standard of living.   The bet is that a supply-demand equilibrium won't change to keep prices of foreign goods *relatively* the same. The difference is a cut into obscene corporate profits.   Remember, she'd also raise the minimum wage to $15/hour. You need protections, so those existing jobs don't go abroad.  The next thing is about the sudden increase in worker cost. That's where eliminating most student loan debt and M4A comes in. More spending money would offset the wage increase and keep small business afloat.   Now, there's another bet about inflation. While there will be an increase in money circulation with an increased deficit, the redistribution of bank wealth will move from complex financial instruments to savings & loans. The Federal Reserve would be able to manage the new increase in inflation at an incremental rate as it is supposed to. But you're also looking at a 10-year road map.   You have to look at all her plans when combined together; not just individually. Saying that, the economic risks under her plans are far less than under Bernie's. Bernie's plans don't take into account market behavior and Bernie's bet on MMT is dangerous because of it. I believe Warren has a far better understanding of economics than any other candidate.
I don‚Äôt have a car :(
Although she's adopted a few of Bernie's policies, she's not really a "copycat candidate"- remember how progressives tried to "Draft Warren" in 2014 before anyone really knew who Bernie was? Similarly, her 2012 Senate campaign (post-Occupy Wall Street) was powered by small donors in a similar fashion that Bernie's presidential run would be in 2016. (I am a fan of both, so followed both their campaigns).  And actually, Bernie's copied a few of her policies, too (student loan debt forgiveness, breaking up Big Ag, implementing a wealth tax \[Bernie's 2014 plan was more of an estate tax\], etc.)  As far as pulling Republican swing votes, [she has been](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-supporter-elizabeth-warren-2020-election-vote-a9127086.html) (if anecdotal evidence is accepted, people's relatives on this sub have been swayed, as they LIKE that she [used to be a Republican](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu8D7yrbrT0)\- and after all, the biggest swing vote in the 2018 midterms were suburban Republican women who got sick of Trump).
I agree - Warren can and should pick a VP to help her secure victory in the election. I like Stacy Abrams for VP, myself. My thoughts on a Bernie/Warren ticket were probably not fully thought through though, fair point. I mean I‚Äôd like it, I‚Äôd have loved that ticket in 2016, but I don‚Äôt think Bernie is the right choice to lead the democratic party currently. And Bernie should definitely not be Warren‚Äôs VP.
and who do you want to win?
[deleted]
Literally came here to say that Stacey Abrams ‚Äî if she wants it ‚Äî seems like a/the obvious choice for VP. Really hoping that Warren, if she secures the nomination, doesn‚Äôt pick a generic-Tim-Kaine-white-guy for VP.
I completely agree with your thoughts on Bernie/Warren. I think Castro would be great as Warren‚Äôs VP, personally, although Abrams would be rad as well.
A quick look at their comment history demonstrates they're a MAGA-hat wearing dolphin fucker.
Why choose that sub though? It's the one most compromised by bots/trolls. That alone shows poor judgement.
Stacy fucking Abrams, my friends! Yes! She is really excellent.
Lmao, and they're calling us delusional?

SFP banned a guy who donated hundreds to the Bernie campaign because he said it was a good thing that Warren banned big money in the general election.  They banned me for saying they should reach out to Hilary supporters after 2016 to improve his chances in 2020.  So I get what you're saying. Unfortunately I'm not sure there is a good Bernie sub on Reddit that represents the good character of most Bernie supporters I know in real life.  But WoTB just seems so much worse every time I visit... It's like a userbase of Trump supporters pretending to be Bernie supporters. Maybe I'm wrong but it really creeps me out.
WoTB is not light on moderation. They censor users who they do not agree with. I literally can not comment there unless there are no 4-letter words in my comment (or they will be auto removed). I‚Äôm a major Bernie supporter, back from 2016 election.   Worse, the mods participate and encourage attacking other users. Bernie supporters, like me, included. With petty name calling. They, including the mods, actively push the Seth Rich conspiracy. Actively deny Russia‚Äôs involvement in hacking related to the last election. Etc. s4P is far better, though not perfect.
I really miss the old Sanders for President sub. I joined when there were only a couple thousand people, before he even announced his intention to run for president. It really was an incredibly wholesome sub back then.
WoTB has been Trump supporters (and likely Russian military) larping as Bernie supporters for years now
Happened to me as well. Got banned from S4P without explanation, just because I challenged factually wrong statements about Warren while making clear I also support Bernie). Seems like even calls for unity of the progressive movement are considered kind of traitorous there. If Way of the Bern is "light on moderation" does that mean they tolerate the lies, but also the counterspeech, or do they just tolerate the lies?
I guess this explains why S4P seems to have gone downhill lately. Is K4S still any good?

Yah, me too. Those were good days. ;(
Thanks for fighting the good fight, anyway!  I find it bizarre that anyone *wouldn't* want unity in the progressive movement (who was in good faith, anyway). I mean, in a democracy, majority rules, and you need all the people you can get in order to get anything done.  Otherwise, as others have said, it just turns into the People's Front of Judea vs. the Judean People's Front, the two Green Parties, etc.
Oh you should absolutely blame Twitter and Facebook.
You're kidding me right? Real Bernie supporters in real life aren't engaging in the kind of bullshit attacks on Warren on their front page right now.  I.e. https://i.redd.it/fcqjfxo8p0s31.jpg

Joy Reid: Look at how people adore Elizabeth Warren now that she is not seeking power
Right on. Yesterday, as so many powerful Democrats - men and women - lamented her losses and the role of sexism in her defeat, I couldn't help but think how different things might have looked if any of those people had endorsed her when they had the chance.
Warren is too good for our stupid country.
In 2016 all we heard was, "I'd vote for a woman, just not THAT woman" and when we found the woman who checked all the boxes, they're still like "no, not her either". What more do we have to do?
People seem to like women best when they give up authority and are no longer a threat.
Clinton legit had some weaknesses. 30 years of being slandered by right wing media. She could come across as snarky and didn‚Äôt always seem authentic.   Elizabeth had none of those weaknesses, except that she, too, was a woman. Ugh.
She'd be the nominee if she was a dude. Her biggest weakness was being a woman unfortunately
The longer I live, the more appealing it seems to go off and start a feminist commune in the woods somewhere.
I find we are always more appreciated as long as we stay in "our place.‚Äú  And it's always fun to hear the inevitable question about how a woman will manage her business/political life with home life.  The same way my male opponents do it, assholes.
I wish they would‚Äôve shown that adoration for her at the polls
Joy Reid has been killing it with her commentary this primary. Her perspective on when she knew Biden would sweep the south via the Black vote was so good. She better get Chris Matthews spot.
This. Shes getting more media coverage after she dropped out than at any time in the primary post Iowa. There are three tickets out of Iowa until a woman earns one.   There are entire shows and segments talking about her candidacy, policies etc now that she‚Äôs out. The media erasure was Absolutely ridiculous and contributed to her fall.
It's because they want to convince warren supporters to join their candidate's team.  It's pathetic.
These honeyed words have followed every single candidate that drops out.  The establishment is very welcoming of diversity as soon as it doesn't pose a threat to the status quo.
I spent a lot of time on Twitter after Pete dropped out, then Mike, and then Liz. The sentiment i saw was a lot different between them.  For Liz It was akin to how a frightened person might lash out once the threat was gone. For Pete and Mike is was more like saying goodbye to an old friend (but one you never had much affection for)  I feel her threat to the status quo was more than they could handle and the fact that it was coming from a woman made it even harder for them, almost like how dare she...   But for supporters of Liz it was like saying goodbye to someone you love and will miss dearly.
The sufferage never stopped it just wears a different mask.
It's because Liz is everything the Dems profess to be, but aren't really.
I don‚Äôt know how this election is going to go. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be Bernie or Biden and I don‚Äôt know if that candidate will win or lose against Trump. But I think one essential truth that we will take away from this primary in the years to come is that if Elizabeth Warren had been a man, she‚Äôd have been the 46th President of the United States.
That speech is short and amazing.
I wish the media gave EW as much attention as they are now
It's crazy how many supportive posts and articles I've seen since she dropped out. Where were you people for the past 1.5 years?
This is true.  I hope she is in VP consideration.
"Women had it in their grasp and they let it go."  Pretty devastating and damning statement there from Joy Reid.
So accurate. Get over your mommy issues and vote in women
So much this! It's actually really gross. It's almost like they know exactly how craven their dislike of Warren is.   When it mattered, no one was there to fight the fight with her. Now that she might be able to help them, they are happy to sing her praises. Sadly, many women won't be surprised by this at all.
Truer words were never spoken. Really love Joy and they need to give her Chris Matthew's slot on a permanent basis ASAP.
Now [Krystal Fucking Ball](https://twitter.com/krystalball/status/1235680871060922369) is tweeting positively about her!!! I'm quitting the internet forever.
When I saw this I felt sick. Those Women are upset about Warren leaving. I would be ok with that if any of them were Warren supporters. Yes, a woman president would be great if women could vote for her. But don‚Äôt NOT support her and then be upset when she gets out for lack of support. The ONLY folks with that argument should be female Warren supporters.
Joy was fabulous last night.
Joy should get the Hardball slot. She is fantastic. Always speaks the truth.
I was going to post something along the lines of "Doesn't it seem like today is the most attention her campaign has gotten?" Where were they in October???
The right and Russia wants the left to fight with itself. Stop letting them win
Amen
yeah basically this
I'm not a big fan of Joy Reid, she's spot on here.
I need this clip saved to my phone.
I‚Äôm a guy so my reaction may not be fair but that felt a little victim blame-y.

This is just human nature.  Nobody thought Trump was a "nazi" or the epitome of evil until he sought power as well.  A blowhard, sure.  But a "lovable" one.  He used to be a welcome guest on shows like SNL, late night circuit, etc.   Hell, the Clintons even went to his wedding.
[removed]
Or if any media outlet actually mentioned her name after Iowa.
Yessssss, I thought the same thing too! Maybe if they had showed up when the fight was tough, they could have actually influenced for the good. It's easy to say something afterwards.
It was the same for Pete too. He got called racist and a corporate sellout for quite a while, but boy were those pundits all admiring his grassroots movement and his Douglass plan.  It felt like a lot of the good progressive voices this time around were ignored until they were gone.
And the media played a role in that sexism.  It's like they are now regretting their the role they played, but they played it nonetheless.  They never learn.
Yep. On that thread, I wish Bernie hadn't run and had gathered his supporters around her to run as one progressive faction. Warren would have an easy path to the nomination right now as a progressive candidate who is working to make moderate ideas better.
I couldn‚Äôt agree more
My husband knows a woman at work who was a computer programmer at the Pentagon in the 90s. Even though she fully admits that being a woman programmer sucked and she had to face a ton of sexism she is still adamant that women shouldn‚Äôt have the right to vote. And that men should be the only ones who should be president. Oh and she‚Äôs been a divorced single mom since like the early 2000s always talking about how hard it had been so it‚Äôs not like she even has a controlling husband or anything. The level of internalized misogyny some women have is absolutely mind blowing.
I think voters are terrified of what happened in 2016 and are having nightmares that it might happen again and have internalized this may be the outcome if the nominee is a female again, which is the wrong message to interpret from Clintons loss IMO.  As a result they want to pick a 'safe' option, i.e. not a female.
https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-dont-hate-women-candidates-i-just-hated-hillary-clinton-and-now-believe-that-elizabeth-warren-is-responsible-for-the-collapse-of-the-republic
It‚Äôs always the same excuses. There‚Äôs always a silly disqualifier. There are always small reasons to justify holding women to a standard twice as high as men.   You can‚Äôt ever convince me that Biden is more electable and more qualified than Warren.
> I'd vote for a woman, just not THAT woman  That was always bullshit. Hillary was by far the most qualified person to be President
That‚Äôs why we need to ignore it when they argue it‚Äôs wrong to vote just because they are a woman. We had several qualified women run this year whether you‚Äôre a moderate or progressive. And yet when someone said that the candidate being a woman was a plus they got slammed for it. They use it to hold qualified women to a different, impossible standard than male candidates. It‚Äôs ok to vote for a woman because she is a woman. Clearly this country has been voting on a candidate being male as an added plus for over 200 years.
The thing is Hillary checked most of those boxes too and so many people just went "Nah" and that was that.
It's his turn!
grow a penis, apparently.
Well, did Elizabeth ever consider not BEING a woman? Check and mate! /s
I stand by my 2016 primary vote. Clinton was not right for the country. I stand by my 2020 primary absentee vote too. Warren is absolutely right for the country
I feel like warren could have been a contender in 2016. Bernie even said if she ran, he wouldn‚Äôt have.
Several women about the same age as Warren said things to me over the last year like, ‚ÄúWomen can‚Äôt be leaders.‚Äù One woman said, ‚ÄúYou know an organization is in trouble when they hire a woman to run it.‚Äù I‚Äôm afraid that this is a generational issue that will take another 20-30 years to change enough with voters to even consider it. It shocks me that this is still so much of an issue.
As a male Warren backer who is crushed that she‚Äôs not the nominee (unless something miraculous happens), there is truth in this statement. There is also truth in realizing that women are not a voting block. Groups you were born into tell very little about us. Groups you choose say much more about how you think and what kind of person you are.  We will continue to fight past sexism, and racism, and homophobia, and all the other negative things in our midst. We will continue to fight for the progressive agenda. We will continue to fight for a Warren White House and for every strong and competent leader who shares her values, from Ayana Pressley to Julian Castro.  Blood and teeth.
Damn this sub went from ‚ÄúGet EW elected‚Äù to ‚ÄúFuck the patriarchy‚Äù overnight.
Liz had few weaknesses but plenty of competition. Ofc Liz had an uphill climb because of her gender, but I think she could have done it if she wasn't being attacked from both the left and the right the entire primary.   If Bernie doesn't run, half the moderates also dont run, and this race is basically Biden v Warren from the start. Even with the sexism of today, I'm convinced she wins that.
The Hillary treatment is what Fox news is trying to do to AOC now. Trying to pack in as much lies about her asap because they know she can rise to power much sooner. They're especially worried since she wields the power of her platform and social media a lot better than they expected.
Warren is a political outsider trying to inch her way to the inside. That's night and day compared to Hilary, a career insider. If you're looking to solve the puzzle, start there. Hilary paid her dues and the DNC propelled her forward. Many of the banking executives EW was going after are major campaign contributors. Meanwhile Hillary was quite cozy with them (and her husband repealed Glass Steagall).
I think the snake mudslinging hurt her a lot as well, alongside trump having his little pet name for her ("oh god he's already prepared for her clearly she can't win"), but it felt like the media was like "female Bernie" and then ignored her.
Very well could be but we also have to critique her campaign to an extent. The Medicare for All debacle objectively hurt her, especially with Bernie admitting taxes would go up. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that he surged, and Liz faltered after that moment. Politically, she tried to bridge two groups of Democrats together, and I think Super Tuesday is showing that the party is too fractured for that.
You might like this book ;) [https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Herland\_(novel)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Herland_(novel))
Joy Reid is one such person who love Elizabeth Warren now that she‚Äôs out of the race. She couldn‚Äôt stop fucking talking about Joe Biden before he entered the race while Warren was cruising toward the top of the field, she had time for Pete and Amy but barely any for Liz. Nah, let‚Äôs not re-write MSNBC‚Äôs role in minimizing Warren.
Would love to see it. Would definitely tune in for that slot if she had it. Nothing against Kornacki, but she's perfect for that slot.
Tbh, I don't think she should be allowed to take such a high profile spot after this kinda of Islamaphobia:  >Although he makes a salient point here:  >>My feeling is that the only reason that a world war between civilizations has not already broken out is that the vast majority of Muslims living in the world today are so desperately poor that they have the time, energy and resources for only the occasional burst of AK-47 fire into the air from the garbage and sewage laden streets outside of their mud huts. Give them resources and I fear that they will come after us everywhere that they can find us, which is to say everywhere.   [source - her blog (reid report)](http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060207043723/http://blog.reidreport.com/)  I'd like to at least see an apology or something else that suggests that she has grown and moved past this.
She's definitely killing it. That's why they'll give the next promotion to a basic white man.
The comments from ‚Äúüêçüêçüêç‚Äù to ‚ÄúPLEASE ENDORSE‚Äù overnight has been equally fascinating, pathetic, and enraging.
It‚Äôs like seeing a soft boi after he‚Äôs been dumped.
Am I missing something? Is this a proper use of the term suffrage? I thought suffrage is just the right to vote.
Suffrage is a positive thing. People fight to get suffrage for themselves.
Problem with that is it would take her out of the senate.
I mean, she didn‚Äôt really say anything nice about Liz. She just said ‚ÄúAdam, you‚Äôre lucky to have her fighting for you.‚Äù  Lmao. Typical.  I hate her.
100% true but how do we stop them?  It's only been effective because there is close to no way to fight it with an anonymous internet.
I see your point, but I think she‚Äôs just being a realist. If women don‚Äôt demand a woman President, men certainly aren‚Äôt going to.
Idk why you're being downvoted; that's exactly what Reid did at the end there.  She said voting women were responsible for not nominating a woman and it means we (I'm a woman) didn't want it enough the way black voters wanted a black president.  It's pretty fucking infuriating because even if every black voter voted Obama, he wouldn't have gotten in without non-black voters; that's just math.  Going from there, b/c women are divided into parties--meaning we can't count on Republicans or Independents to vote for our nominee--we now have to bank on *all* Democratic women voting for a woman in order to make it happen?  And what, we can't look to the men and say, "Where the fuck is your vote"?    Women have been rallying around women candidates for a *long* time; what needs to change isn't us, but the media, the pundits, the other candidates, and their supporters not being sexist.
Right, why blame *women* for this?
Oh, it's obvious why Berners are reaching out--they realized their "revolution" was short a few thousands of votes due to their non-existent constituency and now need us.  Both of the remaining candidates have weaknesses; to suggest Sanders and his lifelong career of questionable judgement is not going to be picked over is naive cult-think on his side.
Unfortunately that flies the face of what several of Bernie's supporters and surrogates have said and done, and the formula where Bernie's supporters get whipped into a froth and refuse to vote is much closer to 2016's formula than Biden's current messaging of party unity and focusing on defeating Trump instead of other Democrats.
No, he proved his evil with the 'Mexicans are rapist' nonsense, the mocking a disabled reporter, reading off a Muslim ban during the campaign, etc etc. He was a horrible person before and still is.

Removed: Trolling.
This!  At first I agreed with the woman in the video, but then thinking on it more, it wasn't just women that stopped Warren, it was also men preferring other candidates (even if Warren's message matched what they wanted, my husband for example fell into this), and then further more, the media vilifying her as well as the entire system set up to be voting more akin to the electoral college than to a popular vote as well as not every state has voted yet!!!  While I was able to vote in SC, if I was still living in Wisconsin I would have _not_ been able to vote!  The entire system, media and primary voting, is flawed and archaic and in a post-Trump political landscape, both need to be overhauled, otherwise we will just end up with Trump having a second term, if not his kids following afterwards.
I don‚Äôt really care for or about Pete one way or the other, but I don‚Äôt think his treatment is comparable. Especially when we are talking about what it will take to elect a woman and give her voice the weight it deserves in the process. Pete was, in my opinion, taken FAR more seriously than his embarrassingly limited experience merited. As Amy pointed out, a woman with his slim resume would never have been seen as a legitimate contender for the Presidency. I‚Äôm not going to argue about Pete‚Äôs progressivism or lack thereof because it has been done to death. But he benefited from male privilege from the start of his campaign to the end. And taking a conversation about the plight of a woman candidate and making it into a conversation about how your golden boy didn‚Äôt get a fair shake is obnoxious.
I don't think Pete was a "progressive voice"...  [This video](https://youtu.be/DMmoB2WMMlo) definitely speaks to a specific kind of audience but it nevertheless does a good job pointing out some more problematic aspects of Buttigeig's stances on issues (including the Douglass plan you mentioned).
Maybe he would have gotten more positive coverage of his Douglas plan if he didn‚Äôt try to fake black endorsements.   Also Pete was not ignored. The only reason why he nearly won NH is because he won Iowa and got a shit ton of media coverage. Before the primary actually started he got millions of dollars in free media attention and coverage. More than Kamala, Booker or Gillibrand. He‚Äôs a young former mayor of a college town yet he got more attention and press than any of the more experienced minority or female candidates. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair of you to try and put him in the same situation with Warren. I agree that he‚Äôs more progressive than people on the internet claimed he was (but that‚Äôs mainly because they said that he was a republican).
This. This exactly.
> The level of internalized misogyny some women have is absolutely mind blowing.  Yeah. It's a phenomenon of systems of oppression. The oppressed reinforce their own oppression.
Yep, an Admin at my previous job (a woman) didn't think women had the 'brains' to use the vote right. My only hope is we wait long enough and all these people die off, and their stupid opinions die with them.  &#x200B;  It's so depressing.
This is why Republicans will have the first female president.  The only women who can capture these voters will need to have a boot on the neck of women, and that's something modern Trump conservatives can mostly get behind.
Wow, to think i'm more of feminist than a lot of women... that's weird.  Interesting point made by  Cornell philosophy professor Kate Manne:  > Misogyny rewards women who reinforce the status quo and punishes those who don‚Äôt
Wat  I am....speechless
I'm so curious to know her reasoning behind her beliefs.
omg that's horrifying
I also think Liz's path to the nomination was over the top of Bernie Sanders. The left isn't strong enough that both could be competitive, and we saw both surge at different times as we saw them take the progressive mantle. Bernie ended up a lot luckier with the timing of his peak than Warren; if her summer surge happened before Iowa, I think Bernie and Warren's positions would be reversed now.
Southern dems view it as their job to pick someone they *think* can win the General election. They take the primary very seriously. You get a powerful combination of sexism from an older traditional cohort plus their fear of everybody elses sexism. Then what happened in the south on Tuesday is the result.
Its both. Like seriously, if Elizabeth Warren were a man you‚Äôd think she is better than everyone else, not that that means everyone would vote for her because voting isn‚Äôt a purely rational decision. Obviously its impossible to convince anyone of it because its impossible to disassociate her gender from everyone‚Äôs perception or concept of her, and even then people might be stubborn to admit their bias.  Its not just sexism, but lets also not pretend like that has no part in the decision making process.

Weird endorsement, but ok.
Knowing that Warren is the boogieman that keeps Coulter up at night in her sarcophagus is just... *chef's kiss*
Is....is this an endorsement?
As terrible as Coulter is/can be, I imagine that even she has had to work harder than every man she's come across in her career to get to where she is.   So this is clearly a veiled nod to Warren and a verbal slap to the back of the head of Democratic voters that are still failing to see that the best candidate on stage is the one that's been the best debater, most prepared, and shouts the least.
This is...exactly Liz‚Äôs pitch lol   We‚Äôre in the end times.  But truly this is what I worry about with a Bernie win. Nothing I‚Äôve seen from him suggests a huge interest in the work of governing or the leveraging his position to enact structural change. Ask him about the first 100 days and he mentions rallies. It‚Äôs like he sees the election as the end point. I worry with him that if he fails to deliver, especially as a second term is unlikely, progressivism is dead in the water for a generation.
I‚Äôm reminded of Rush Limbaugh‚Äôs rambling tirade about how ‚Äúliberals are just okay with AaAAanYThInG when it comes to sex as long as there‚Äôs CoNSeNt‚Äù  Like...yeah? Where did you think the burn was there, my man?
Spot on, Ann... and that's why I voted for her.
Exactly. I would hope that most fellow Yanggangers would see that she‚Äôs the most data-driven and solutions-oriented of the remaining candidates.
She is a real life Leslie knope.
They really are the party of feckless ineptitude. At least Ann's being upfront about it.  I think we need a new sticker to go along with "Nevertheless, she persisted" that says "She's the Freak"
Accidentally gave the best reason why Warren is the best candidate. Thanks, Ann coulter!  Never thought I'd say THAT sentence out loud and mean it.
Are Tweets copyrighted?  Cause this needs to be on campaign merch.
Waiting for Liz to do a replay of the scene in the simpsons movie where she is presenting 5 plans at the same time to the president or congress or whatever.
If Nazi Barbie hates it, I love it.
Absolutely! Who knew Ann Coulter would 'endorse' Elizabeth Warren? ;) Bring on the plans!
dah Freak gets it done!
This is by far the best endorsement I've seen for Liz!!
The condition of Warren being part of a Sanders admin should he be the candidate is what makes Bernie viable imo. I love Bernie but I just feel Warren outclasses him.
And I love it! Give me a government that works hard for its citizens!
Lmao oh no y'all Ann Coulter is after us!
Sounds like an endorsement to me
weird. what's her angle?
Don't threaten me with a good time, Ann
Ann Coulter was hilarious for years. Kinda sorry to see her material now.
Anything coming out of that woman's crazy MOUTH is not worth spit!!!
Yes, Anne. That‚Äôs what we like about her.
LOL this reminds me of Rubio's comment that Obama knows what he's doing.
Always ignore Republicans opinions on the Democratic primary.  They are never arguing in good faith.
Warren could make a great president that America Deserves. And if she doesnt get the nomination, I hope she gets the VP at least. America would be better with her mind at the helm.
[removed]
In Ann Coultiers mind?  Yes.  In anything resembling reality?  No.
I mean, by comparison to who we have RN? I suppose so.  This truly is a bizarro timeline.
Given how insane the current administration is in both uselessness and vile policy, yes.
Knowing Ann Coulter, I‚Äôm sure she views it as a strategic tweet to split the progressive vote.
A huge part of conservative ideology (traditional conservatism, not the shift to absolute faith in a single figurehead that we have today) stems from the notion that progressive policy will bankrupt the nation. For a not-insignificant portion of the conservative base, fear of liberal policy destroying the economy is the primary reason for looking past other ‚Äúless attractive‚Äù aspects of conservatism today.  Conservative leaders get this - most probably 100% believe it - but they‚Äôre also cognizant of the fragility of that belief. They understand that there‚Äôs a scenario, however likely, where a progressive president could enact progressive policy and the economy survives. If the country doesn‚Äôt completely fall apart under a progressive government, a major pillar of conservatism does.
Basically, conservatives want the government to do absolutely nothing other than start unnecessary wars and protect the wealthy.
Well this got me my brilliant new user name!  I needed one just for this sub!
No I'm pretty sure that was a veiled endorsement, well who knows and who gives a shit about Ann Ghoulter

Her and Bloomberg are about as big a self-endorsement as you could ask.
>As terrible as Coulter is/can be, I imagine that even she has had to work harder than every man she's come across in her career to get to where she is.  It‚Äôs telling that she refers to Liz as ‚ÄúSen. Warren‚Äù and the other one as ‚ÄúBernie.‚Äù
He had an interview on CNN after the debate and repeated something he's said before but it stuck with me.  He was asked how he'd pass progressive stuff through Congress and he basically said he'd be a different kind of president where he's go hold rallies for issues around the country. He said he'd go to Kentucky and hold rallies for the minimum wage and stuff and that would somehow convicne McConnell and Paul to vote for his bills.  It's nice to think about in theory but laughably naive as a practical governing plan. Sure, maybe that could work with some Democrats but it'll have no effect on red states republicans. And he's not willing to get rid of the filibuster so red state republicans will hold a veto over his entire legislative agenda.   Sanders simply has no realistic plan to deliver anything he supports and when pressed on it, he and his supporters duck and Dodge and say you're not a believer.  Warren has detailed plans and wants to kill the filibuster. And if she can't pass things, she has already laid out some EOs. She's said she's willing to compromise as needed but mainly focuses on "Dream Big" as your starting position. Very different and much better which is why I like her.
Yep. Being President is more than just repeating your stump speech ad infinitum.
He just has too much opposition. Too alienating. Sure he brings out the youth vote but old people shun him, and they are WAY more reliable voters. Sure he brings in progressives but moderates, independents, and conservatives are terrified of socialism.   https://news.gallup.com/poll/285563/socialism-atheism-political-liabilities.aspx  I see him being a net negative overall. Trump and republicans are just anxiously waiting to unleash a torrent of ads solidifying him as a socialist and no amount of youth or liberal Latino enthusiasm is going to overcome that.
I'm pretty sure that Bernie will lose to Trump tbh.  A lot of voters are going to pick Trump over a "scary revolutionary socialist" which is exactly what the GOP and stealth Russian intelligence will successfully paint him as during the general.  He just has too much baggage to overcome it in the eyes of swing voters.
Another example of Conservatives Threatening Us With A Good Time.
Maybe Rush wasn't as offended with the "anything" as much as the "consent" part.  üòÆ
Warren got that poll bump after that hate-fic about her and that ex-marine.
I‚Äôve heard her described as a policy wonk and I‚Äôd love that as a flair or t shirt or something. I‚Äôm a policy wonk too!
Can we get the rights to play Super Freak at her next rally please?
Removed: Rule 11
If Anne supports you, there‚Äôs something wrong
Actually in comparison to Bernie Sanders
I'm sure Ann Coulter would love to see Trump run against Bernie.
Good catch!   I try really hard not to perpetuate the historical conditioning of seeing politics as our team vs theirs, but anyone who has participated in some form of competition should recognize the position of respecting a move or skill that an opponent displayed without overtly cheering for them. I think this is one of those moments.
Warren needs to call him on this bs. Like if he actually has to say on a debate stage ‚ÄòMcConnell will pass M4A after I hold a rally in Kentucky‚Äô she can expose him as naive at best and unqualified for the job at worst   If he did actually win this Liz would be doing 93% of the work, guaranteed
The whole rally thing creeps me the fuck out, I don't care who is at the head of it. There's got to be a more productive use of time. Leading up to an election with a specific time frame, I can understand, but outside of that, gross.
> He said he'd go to Kentucky and hold rallies for the minimum wage and stuff and that would somehow convicne McConnell and Paul to vote for his bills.  If this is truly his plan, Warren ***has*** to call him out on it. The turtle and libertarian care nothing about their constituents. They'd laugh at Bernie's tactics (and probably already are). If Warren really wants to win this, she has to push her plans/EOs and contrast that with Bernie's ridiculous "rally strategy".  If Bernie defeats Trump, we'll have four years of gridlock and an old man yelling at rallies. Pretty much what we have now without the overt fascism. Warren has to take the battle to Bernie. ***Now.***
The first time I heard him say this I was really astonished. The thing about Bernie - he doesn‚Äôt say things with political calculus in mind, that‚Äôs why a lot of people admire him. He must believe that this will actually work. I do not.  Yikes.
Of course he thinks rallies solve everything.  Like Trump, they will be the only part of the job he wants to do.
I wish this came up in debates.
Even though I'm not a Bernie stan, I would've expected him to be more on building local coalitions than relying just on rallies, if he's truly about being a movement. Rallies get butts in seats, but real change comes from organzing, supporting, and building groups that involve people who are dedicated to the issues.
>Sure, maybe that could work with some Democrats but it'll have no effect on red states republicans.  I'd imagine he sees it as a Huey Long/Teddy Roosevelt situation where he sets up on the bully pulpit and expects his supporters to harass targets into submission. It sounds silly until you realize that a cult of personality has arisen around Sanders, and he really could be a demagogue that rules with an 'iron fist'.
Those rallies are indeed part of the plan though.  Warren's plan accounts for building public support, but it also accounts for building support from the inside too, and can Bernie do that?  A Warren\Sanders ticket is what we need, with Bernie as VP cause VP would have the time to drum up public support leaving Warren as president to set up all the blocks in Washington.
Yeah... I hate to agree with Pete but the anti-Trump wave to ride is in those swing House districts. Suburbia. My hope is the hatred of Trump is so strong they‚Äôll vote for anyone, even Bernie.
Trump supports him?  (Seriously, Trump sent out a tweet telling Bernie good luck and an at-em boy) At least he's got that going for him.
Younger voters tend to be more Bernie or Bust and say they will only show up to vote if he gets the nom. They aren't showing up at the primaries in big numbers yet, so not sure I really believe that. Older people tend to be Never Bernie and they do show up. Now maybe they'll come around, but I doubt five months of "Commie Bernie and his death panels" attack ads or whatever they come up with is going to motivate voters. I've heard 70 year old men say that this could be the first election they sit out.
I feel like there are two kinds of people in this primary:  those that live in a leftist bubble and think that all it takes is to calmly talk about democratic socialist issues and they will win; and the rest of us; those of us who don't live in a bubble and understand how easy it will be for the GOP with the help of Russian intelligence to turn Bernie into a toxic revolutionary extremist in the eyes of the voters that we need to actually win the election.
Yep I think he loses too. And the House.  Put the weird cervical cancer essays on rotation in the houses of the suburban white women who swung 2018 for 4 months and...no.   Tbh it‚Äôs going to be incredibly difficult for anyone given the electoral college (unless there‚Äôs a recession) but he‚Äôs so risky  Then again Biden is also high risk. He‚Äôs not sharp.
People really are mouth-breathers that want the loudest rhetoric, aren't they?
Do you listen to the Podcast ‚ÄúKnowledge Fight‚Äù? That‚Äôs what they call their supporters. Makes me laugh when I see that expression in the wild.
Maybe not. Rick James has some...history...with women that does not work with Warren's vibe.
And there's a good chance of you being a Nazi.
How much Bernie Sanders gets done is entirely dependent on how hard we work to flip the senate and continue being involved after elections. Doesn't matter if you're Warren or Sanders a republican senate will not work to pass legislation, that much is clear.
To be real, the entire GOP can‚Äôt believe their luck right now. Nominating Bernie would be tantamount to gift wrapping the election and handing it to Trump.
Maybe, but wouldn‚Äôt she be trying to boost Bernie‚Äôs profile if that were the case? I think she wants a brokered convention that would leave as many democrats salty as possible.  Edit: lol no, you guys downvoting me are probably right. Ann coulter has no intention of pitting democrats against each other.... silly.
One of the few non-shitshow parts of last night's debate was Warren more or less making this exact point about his health care plan, where she has actually done the work to make her plan viable when she gets into office and he very much hasn't.
She would be doing the work, but Sanders would be taking credit for it.
I worry it is too late now. The time to do this was months ago before people started voting.
It‚Äôs what Trump does. He just never stopped campaigning.
Unquestioning adulation is apparently a hell of a drug.
I think the idea is that the fight for these policies we want is not going to stop after winning the election.  At that point you will need to convince congress and the senate. Even if we have a super majority, getting anything passed is going to be hard, a potential repeat of what happened with the affordable care act.   Rallies are a show of force and they can be an effective way to move people up the ladder of engagement. Political movements need volunteers and donors; people to make their case. When people meet in a real space to listen and support a politician and discuss policies, the movement itself has more chances to be more interconnected. Our movement will live or die with the strength of the cohesion and organization of the groups that populate it. Rallies are a good way to sew that network together into a stronger fabric.
When is the next debate anyway?   Looking at the new Texas poll which has her at 14%, I think her strategy was to bomb Bloomberg again and leave Bernie mostly alone because a) Bloomberg seems to be pushing her just under the viability line and b) she understands momentum and doesn‚Äôt want Bloomberg to create any   If she‚Äôs still alive after Super Tuesday she can take it to Bernie  ETA: She also has the highest net favorability in Texas by a good margin. The electability issue really has been poison. Everyone likes her, few are willing to stick their necks out.
I think he's being totally honest when he says he believes he will get so many people to come to the polls that it really will be a political revolution. The problem is that I don't think he has any plan for what happens if he gets elected but that revolution doesn't occur in the size needed to actually remove people like McConnell from power.
Like he has a base of supporters in every single major city, it just baffles me  why he won't talk about how he will involve them in his presidency if he's a president of the people.
I‚Äôm a fan of a warren/Amy ticket because klobuchar is a moderate senate democrat and I really think the 2 of them could unite everyone who‚Äôs to the left of the career republicans. Especially if we see a Romney bloc form, we could essentially override any McConnell republican and create a progressive agenda that has tons of support.      Disclaimer: not a Bernie fan, but open to spirited debate on this.
IMO having Bernie anywhere on the ticket is electoral suicide. We‚Äôd lose the house and probably some senate seats.
Pete is absolutely on the money, loathe as I am to admit it.  Bernie‚Äôs theory of his path to electoral college victory is bunk. It would rely on a huge youth turnout the likes of which we‚Äôve never seen before and the primary isn‚Äôt showing that turnout. He‚Äôs winning because of the split field and picking up momentum as more people jump on the bandwagon of the anointed winner. But he needs college educated white people and boomers and he does very poorly with both demos. And he‚Äôs conceded Florida from the start.
Trump wants Bernie to win the nomination because it gives him the best chance at reelection. So does Russia, for the same reasons. Gross.
I keep asking myself why.  Why, when we had a whole host of competent likeable good candidates.  Not only Warren, but Castro, Booker, Harris.  That we are ending up with Sanders or Biden (or god forbid, Bloomberg)?  I have to believe that this is backlash because of Trump.  That they won't risk a woman or POC, but seem to be willing to risk a guy who has trouble finishing sentences or a socialist with a mountain of baggage.  Because they are white men.  If we'd known this earlier than maybe Jay Inslee could have been pressured to stop just talking about climate change and go all in as a serious candidate.  He's a governor after all.  And progressive.  Without baggage and able to finish sentences
Ahh that‚Äôs fair, damn.
Disagree. Considering most of the senate Democrats have not endorsed any of his plans, I strongly doubt Bernie gets anything done even if we flip every senate seat that's up this cycle. Warren has an actual history of getting moderate Dems to support progressive ideas. I think a Bernie Sanders presidency is a second Jimmy Carter presidency, so I still prefer Warren by a mile.
1. Clarifying what the tweet said. 2. Responding to the undercover defense/promotion of Bernie supporters on this sub. Their tactics include trying to mitigate and deflect even the mildest criticism against Sanders in a stealth way. 3. In times of crisis - Warren has a history of making huge, improbable, progressive change, eg. dreaming up, organizing fighting for, building a whole new federal agency to be an active check against financial institution fraud. She had to fight Republicans and Democrats to make this happen. Bernie hasn‚Äôt accomplished anything near comparable in scope or scale.  Your unsupported defense of Sanders is still promotion of Sanders, I wish you wouldn‚Äôt promote him in other candidate‚Äôs subs.  Edited to add context [https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/f9bnwm/seeing\_a\_lot\_of\_bernie\_voices\_saying\_if\_he\_gets\_a/fiqnzfe/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/f9bnwm/seeing_a_lot_of_bernie_voices_saying_if_he_gets_a/fiqnzfe/?context=3)
Maybe, but that's what people said about the GOP nominating Trump in '16...
Is that what your gut tells you? Because polls tell a difference story. I imagine the goal is to pit democrats against each other.
God last night was such a mess.  It was a good opener! I want her to specifically point out the absurdity of running on a promise to pass the most ambitious piece of progressive legislation since the New Deal by protesting outside Mitch McConnell‚Äôs bedroom window in Kentucky.
It pretty much is too late.
You come at the queen, you best not miss.
And wasn‚Äôt Elizabeth Warren warning about the housing crisis years before it happened? She has a pretty good track record of pointing these things out.
This is both delicious in its irony and terrifying in its truth.
It's not even a prediction:  There's a republican in the White House.  Of course it's a recession.
Oh, lookie here, a collection of dums dums to mock.   [https://americarisingpac.org/elizabeth-warrens-politically-motivated-recession-warning-long-on-fear-shorts-on-facts/](https://americarisingpac.org/elizabeth-warrens-politically-motivated-recession-warning-long-on-fear-shorts-on-facts/)
At 33 I‚Äôve never been so excited about a political candidate. Let‚Äôs do this y‚Äôall.
She knows the economy.
Trump got EXTREMELY lucky to inherit Obama‚Äôs economy. When a democrat wins in 2020 and we are all suffering from the Trump economy, stupid people will blame it on the new president.
so i SHOULDNT invest in the stock market right now?
so is it gonna get super shitty in 2020 cause that'd be pleasant timing, if it's inevitable i want it to fuck republicans shit up
What a Cox that guy is
She was right the first time, in the fact of the establishment, she has been prepared to be doubted again, hopefully they don't make the same mistake in the face of financial crisis.
this has aged poorly.
Guess it's a good thing *you* didn't skip that important context, huh Jeff?
Warren is the sober person at the party warning people not to drive, and they get mad at her for bringing down their vibe.
It‚Äôs almost as if she was a professor and one of the country‚Äôs leading experts on this precise subject...
yeah and I'm pretty sure Warren knows how to read a fucking yield curve.
The housing crisis had a lot more signs as the build up was slower.
Literally no one has a good track record of predicting financial market downturns.
That isn‚Äôt how it works.  Recessions are part of the business cycle Hyman Minsky has done quite a lot of work on this subject if you have any interest in understanding why recessions occur.   What the tax cuts like the one in 2017 or the one under GWB do is prolong recovery as ideally you cut income taxes during recessions to boost spending.  When you cut tax revenue while the economy is strong you weaken the ability for this to work when you actually need it.  This is further exacerbated by our low interest rates which we cannot cut much further when the next recession hits.  This our two best responses to a recession have been weakened by the GOP.  The GOP does not cause recessions but their platform since the late 1990s absolutely prolongs recovery.
I like Elizabeth but this is the longest bull run in the history of the country. It's bound to end regardless of who is in office. If anything, he's artificially extended it with tax cuts and pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low.
They did the work for us. LOL.
Happens every time
Don't try to catch a falling knife.  Dollar cost average. Always.
Might want to wait a while and see if the market bottoms out. More bang for your buck in that situation!
You can always short or buy option puts.
Probably should talk to a financial advisor. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/08/recession.asp  >Historically, one of the safer places in the equity market is consumer staples. These are typically the last products that a household removes from its budget.

You mean the original article?
 And when the next kid dies driving home, they'll act like it was totally of their control and nothing could be done.
The funniest shit I've seen on Twitter is how Warren just copies Clinton and Harris. As if Warren doesn't have decades of credentials.
Very well explained.  Thank you.
Some recessions are cyclical, but you can't say every recession is natural. I feel like a lot of this has been because of horrible republican economic policy, and like Warren has been saying, avoidable. Sure recessions are a natural part of the economy, but if you have good regulation in place you can prevent at least the worst parts of that. I think a good part of the blame for this recession falls on Trump's shoulders, especially because of how bad this trade war is.
More accurately, blowing all our cash on the tax cuts did jack all to stimulate the economy, and left our Keynesian toolbox half empty for the coming recession.
I don't know if our federal deficit skyrocketing under Trump or the Chinese trade war offsets a 25 point interest cut.
What about jorts? I've got some wranglers with a rip in the knee
This is horrendously bad advice.
No, this post. It appears recession fears were overblown.
I don't know that I hear people saying she copies Harris or Clinton. She's pretty far left of both. I mostly hear that she uses Bernie's ideas, which is think is bullshit. Just because she wasn't running for president last year on Bernie's platform doesn't mean she's not been fighting for a lot of these policies for years.
Recessions are man made.  Did a cycle start a trade war with China?  Did a cycle remove NAFTA?  Did a cycle give tax cuts to the rich and cut social services for everyone else?  Did a cycle cut emergency funds for natural disasters to build a wall?  Did a cycle cause a hiring freeze in the government?
For equities markets? None of the things you've mentioned seem to be as large a factor as the tax cuts were, which spurred on corporate acquisitions and stock buy-backs - boosting equities markets and continued expansion. Our equities markets haven't cared about the deficit in a long time, why would they start caring because Trump is in office? Hasn't the deficit been growing year over year for almost 2 decades now? Obama almost tripled the deficit his first year in office. Trump hasn't even doubled it since taking office. The trade war is a policy that Warren will very likely continue if she becomes president. It's one of the few Trump policies that has a great deal of strategic importance associated with it.
Shorting jorts is a bad strategy financially (and just in general) - they are unfortunately rising in "popularity" again.
Steve Eisman is shorting Canadian banks, lots of investors are shorting retailers that depend on Chinese imports, food exporters to China are taking a hit. So I would bet against the American economy by shorting stock.
She's a liberal progressive and Bernie is a democratic socialist. Her policies reflect that. The only thing they're identical on is Medicare For All.   For example, Warren's student loan forgiveness doesn't cover the top 1%, while Bernie's does. Warren also has a better way to pay for it than Bernie's solution. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H9cdDuzK6o  Clinton and Harris are more moderate. She pretty much has nothing in common with either of them. However, they all appeal to the same base, which is kinda weird given the policy differences. Bernie has a base that also would vote for someone with the exact opposite policies. That's why Bernie and Warren are not attacking each other. They're after different voters. And for those voters, character is more important to them than policies.
It's only a cycle insomuch as Republicans get into power and immediately start cutting themselves checks at the expense of the middle and working class. As Baron Rothschild once said, "Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if that blood is your own." If it isn't by design, they somehow keep lucking into gobbling up more and more of wealth while everyone else is being wiped out.
Obama did not triple the debt.  The debt tripled while he was in office.  When you say ‚ÄúObama tripled the debt‚Äù you are placing blame on him for that increase.  Factually speaking almost all of the debt increase was due to Congress as they control spending and taxation.    Specifically the three largest sources of the debt increase under Obama were the Iraq and Afghan wars and the tax cuts under GWB.  Obama voted for none of those as he opposed making the cuts permanent and wasn‚Äôt in national politics when the Iraq war was voted on.  Thus blaming Obama rather than Congress is inaccurate at best.  Obama‚Äôs policies were responsible for slightly less than $1T of the debt increase in his eight years.  The rest was largely due to the administration before him and previous Congressional decisions.   For someone who seems to understand finance you seem to not have a good grasp on the basics of how the government handles money/debt and the history of our debt.
You‚Äôre wrong about a number of things. Deficits spiked in 2008-09 then went down every single year under Obama.   Second, Trump may have extended the equity bubble but that stopped end of 2017. To do so he spent a crazy amount of money, causing deficits to spike again, all for a brief spike in growth that has now returned to Obama levels. Are we really better off now with a much higher debt load but no new growth?
Shorting is for professional investors who can tolerate the risk of infinite losses. No one at a reddit advice level about investing should engage in shorts. Not ever.
You don't even know the difference between debt and what I said, the deficit. Go look up the difference, and research your stats while you're at it. Nearly everything you just said is totally wrong.
>You‚Äôre wrong about a number of things. Deficits spiked in 2008-09 then went down every single year under Obama.   First of all I never said deficits didnt decrease after tripling in his first year. Secondly, you're wrong. 2016 deficit increased from 2015. Edit: wait. I dont know why I'm giving you credit for this. The deficit also increased 2010 to 2011 as well. LOL >Second, Trump may have extended the equity bubble but that stopped end of 2017.   Uh, no it didn't... lol do you have any idea what you're talking about? We're 6% off all time highs...  >To do so he spent a crazy amount of money, causing deficits to spike again, all for a brief spike in growth that has now returned to Obama levels. Are we really better off now with a much higher debt load but no new growth?  What are you even talking about? The only "spending" he did was to increase the military budget. The other component was tax cuts... and we're not at "obama levels" in the equity markets. We're significantly above them. Growth rates are measured as a percentage... its much easier to grow from the trough of a recession than it is at the peak of an economic recovery. You people are literally economically illiterate.
I know the difference I just missed that somehow.  Tripling the deficit was still done by Congress as they approve spending.  TARP is almost universally well regarded among economists as it worked and was profitable.    As fir the statements regarding debt and which parts of the government spend money those are 100% true.  Obama is no more responsible for creating most of the increases in the debt or deficits than any other POTUS including Trump.  Congress budgets and spends the money which means it is their responsibility/fault.  You would be hard pressed to find a valid source that would suggest otherwise.    Furthermore suggesting that Obama had any choice but to increase deficit spending in the face of the crash of 08 is just ridiculous.  We could not let the system collapse on itself without causing even worse problems.  Here‚Äôs a tip when you see anyone blaming a president for taxation or spending remember that taxation and spending fall under the purview of Congress not the White House.  POTUS can propose things but Congress ultimately decides what will happen.
I said that *growth* has returned to Obama levels. As in GDP growth. You are confusing that with equity markets. Equities have shot up because Trump gave companies trillions that they used to buy back shares. It didn‚Äôt do squat for the economy.
Ok, so everything you just said literally invalidates the criticism that I was responding to against Trump. You're literally making my point for me.
Wow so you're saying growth immediately after the worst recession in almost 100 years is *equal* to growth rates at the peak of the longest expansion in American history? Wow what an accomplishment!
No because you claimed that almost everything I said wasn‚Äôt true when it was.  Claiming that Obama tripled the deficit his first year is moronic as the Q4 of 08 is part of his first year and was where much of the spending occurred.  Furthermore it was Congress that spent that money not Obama.    The only thing you have said that seems to be correct is that the market largely seems to ignore deficits
No, I‚Äôm not comparing growth to 2008, I‚Äôm comparing it to the end of Obama‚Äôs term. Why don‚Äôt you google for a GDP growth chart and tell me where the Trump spike is?
Ok so if it was Congress who spent the money, why is it Trumps fault that the deficit increased?
Literally everything you're saying is wrong. GDP growth for Obama's last two years was 1.90% and 2.03%.   GDP for Trumps first 2 years has been 2.80% and 2.52%....during a late cycle expansion. Not only is it apples and oranges, with Obama having an incredibly easier starting position for Y/Y growth, but even under those standards, Trumps increases have been larger than the last 2 years under Obama...

Yes!  Time to invest in our people again!!
Make the poor schools as good as the rich schools, and everything in the country gets better.
I really wish Elizabeth would adopt a platform to take the minimum wage away from congress and put it in the hands of an independent commission like so many other countries have.   &#x200B;  In France there's a body that takes a look at the cost of inflation, cost of living, etc. and uses it to calculate an appropriate increase for the minimum wage every year. No politics, no nonsense.
This is a similar pitch that Sanders has, and the danger is equating an era like the 1950s and 1960s as one that valued everyone's success. It absolutely did not. Right now, Warren needs more support from the civil rights wing of the party than the economic rights wing. Usually she's excellent at tying the two together, so I'm hoping this is just a soundbite.
Education is the first rung on the ladder of opportunity!
She was amazing on today‚Äôs CNN Town Hall. She was so enthusiastic. And I loved how sweetly and smartly she handled a question from a transgender boy. The horror if 45 had to address that question...
I read this in her voice! Also good old Colbert Report throwback
I'm uncomfortable with this one, unless there is more context that is taken out of the quote. The America Warren grew up in invested in \*some\* kids.White kdis, precisely. There's a danger in phrasing things liek this as "just return to what it was before" because that was not build on equality or equity, it was built on systematic oppression of black people.  And while obviously I don't think Warren wants to go back to exactly that, it is important to voice it, so that the other necessary structural changes take place.  The reason there is such an overwhelimg resistance to welfare for instace, is that people view welfare recipients as black people, and see them as less worthy of getting help. When welfare recipients were pictured as white, this wasn't the case. The move away from universal support was driven by racism. And to bring back a lot of these programs, we need to address the racist views that got them cut; which starts by remembering that the America Warren grew up in was one of white supremacy.
I'm a fan of that kind of America.
Pretty much everything she says is spot-on. I feel inspired by her every time I listen to a speech, an interview, or just an answer to a question.
The only thing true in this statement was the minimum wage part... Per pupil spending (adjusted for inflation) has gone up like 2x since the 70s alone. Same with Higher Ed.
Where is that america now?   Sounds nice , id love to leave this racist transphobic shit hole and visit that america one day
[deleted]
Says the woman who's backed by multiple massive billion dollar corporations. Yea, for the people.
That‚Äôs not really how things work
It's a good idea, but I bet you if the Republicans got to make appointments there would be both politics and nonsense.
That is such a good point and you put it so well.   This quote is from her 2014 appearance on the Stephen Colbert show.
She does explicitly make that point now ("but this time, we're gonna make it work for everyone" and makes other points with the historical context of racism).
Go home, bot. You're drunk.
Which massive billion-dollar corporations are backing her?
Time to change how things work.
Because...?  It's really easy to say "No!"
It literally is though
He is right. Biggest factors on student academic achievement has little to do with the school itself, it‚Äôs the student‚Äôs home life.
It could have a system like the fed where people working there aren't directly appointed by the president most of the time.
Thank you. It's something I worry about after the big rift in 2016. I want us all on the same side.
Hm. I posted on this because she grew up in Oklahoma, which could likely use investment again. People there want what the left (or, in the olden days, FDR) is offering.   If you ever want to feel hopeful about 2020, read political posts in "red state" city subs.  But all right. This one didn't work. :)
And yet having a quality place to learn that supports its students is effective at mitigating the negatives of a poor home life.
Agreed.   She says ‚Äúevery kid had a fighting chance‚Äù, but it wasn‚Äôt really every kid. And I‚Äôm sure when they hear her say that, it probably irks those who weren‚Äôt given that same chance.   Still, I think her point was, we know that it works. When we invest in our people, they flourish and thrive. We just have to make sure we extend that investment to everyone this time.
The only factor at a school that research supports is the quality of the teacher. Not the facilities or the amount of money put into it. Look at Newark schools in NJ as an example. They received millions for up upgrades to facilities and technology yet no improvement in student performance. And their water is still more toxic then Flint, MI.   Homes that offer food, a safe place, positive reinforcement and parent involvement outweigh the impact of a school.
100% agree, we do.
>The only factor at a school that research supports is the quality of the teacher. Not the facilities or the amount of money put into it.   This is very wrong. [See here](https://sites.psu.edu/ceepa/2015/06/07/the-importance-of-school-facilities-in-improving-student-outcomes/) for a non-exhaustive selection of research that supports the notion that the quality of facilities has a clear effect on outcomes. Environmental psychology is an *incredibly* important factor in student and educator comfort, and comfort begets successful study.
I wonder how a school might attract quality teachers....
Student:Teacher ratio is incredibly important for student success.  Private schools often have 20:1 ratio whereas public schools are sometimes up to 38:1  More funding for poor schools can not only increase classrooms and teachers, and thus improve the ratio, but can also increase incentive for those good teachers you speak of.
When looking at the impacts of academic performance on students the economic standing is the largest impact. The report you linked verified the impact that the environment can have on students, not that the learning environment is the most influential impact on student learning. As I noted Newark has undrinkable water, if this was limited to the building and not the  city, this would fall under the report you linked. Air quality and other environmental conditions do need to be in a state that is safe to staff and students. That is not being debated, the original comment here is that if we  fund "poorer" schools to the same extent as we do "rich" schools it would give everyone the same chance. My comment and the one before it disagree that the funding of facilities would significantly impact learning. I can't speak for all state funding but in NJ, Newark receives a substantial amount of funding to compensate for students needs so they are well funded. Newark also received a $100 million donation from Zuckerberg which still did not result and any substantial impact on student performence. Unfortunately the cost of updating old facilities or building new schools is also absurd. Look into New Brunswick's new high school here in NJ. It cost $187 million dollars for this facility. Do you think that money was well spent?  I do not. There are children who still show up to school hungry, tired, not wearing clean clothing and focused on a million other priorities because their basic needs are not met. I teach in a district that has an interesting population where some kids are very well off and others unfortunately not. The kids that have less do receive free or reduced lunch, are offered tutoring after school to help them but as a district we can not control their home life. My current dissertation on summer regression and the impact of socioeconomic standing in English language learners has data that readers who lack a stable home life without basics needs and do not have an adult to reinforce learning regress at a rate that they can never recover from on their own, I am looking to see if our programs have any significant impact. I get where a lot of people are coming from but I promise you funding the schools wont resolve the root problem.  Go ask a teacher what impacts a students day at school... having a smart board on the wall or if they had dinner last night. I'm all for Warren but just tossing money at schools will not make them better and will continue waste money that could go towards more fundamental needs.
And you are right, classroom ratios are important along with many other variables in student achievement. My response is targeted at the initial comment of "Make the poor schools as good as the rich schools, and everything in the country gets better." which I disagree with from empirical evidence. As noted in another response, putting in money to schools to get them up to par has failed students for decades. I do not know what state you live in but look into the school funding formula your state uses and I am confident you will find decades of lawsuits aiming to change how the funding works because everything is failing our students. To improve academic performance we need to protect our children from harsh living conditions that poverty presents. We need to rebuild our communities that provide a safe and supportive environment for them to grow in. I encourage you to look into your states funding formula and see what towns are receiving funds, then go visit that town and I am sure you would see there are more fundamental needs not being met.
There is a difference between using funding for new tech vs. funding so that poor schools actually have the fundamental supplies.  Are you aware that many poor schools don't even have full book sets for students? That teachers have to buy essentials like paper and pens for students?  I agree the rush to smartboards likely makes no impact to outcomes but when people say poor schools need more funding that's generally not the type of improvements they are talking about. Admins may push for that fancy tech but most educational advocates understand it'd be better spent on more rooms, teachers, and fundamental resources.
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. Yes, I am aware of a lack of complete classroom materials as I have experienced this problem myself over the years. With that though, the initial quote for this thread was "Make the poor schools as good as the rich schools, and everything in the country gets better." and its not that simple. Literally copying and pasting a "rich school" into a lower income will not yield the same results for students because of the factors that influence student achievement beyond the school itself. Ask any educator what impacts student learning the most and anyone with experience will inform you that it is factors schools can not control. My comment is more about healing and developing the community as a whole to help students home lives versus over funding schools when more basic needs have yet to be met. You are correct in your statement about technology but I feel that comment is going down a further tangent that was unintended on my end.
Shout out to whomever decided that the yard signs and bumper stickers would just say WARREN. Not "Warren 2020" or "Warren For President." Because now my bumper sticker just lets everyone know that I support Elizabeth Warren in general.
THIS. I ordered MORE merch two days ago because I can just show off that I love Elizabeth (and will be prepared for when she runs again!)
I went and bought every Warren shirt with a motivational saying. I plan on wearing them to remind people of what they could have had.  President B is having a sexism moment? I'll be wearing my Warren "Enough is Enough: Believe Women" shirt.  We get an M4A alternative that is just the gov. sending "get well soon" cards? You'll see me in my Warren "the time for small ideas is over" shirt  My casual tee fashion is going to be aggressive
I wish I could get more but I‚Äôm broke after spending $100 the other day on more stuff
I‚Äôm keeping my bumper sticker on my car too üëç
I live in Massachusetts. ‚ÄúWarren 2024: Whichever Office‚Äù
Keeping mine for 2024 ;-)
My sticker is staying on too!
I have my yard sign, shirts, and buttons all ready for 2024!
Yep, bought a shirt yesterday to ensure I can show my evergreen support, not slapping 2020 on everything was brilliant. My wife also got me a Billionaire Tears mug which is excellent.
Or that you have a lot of rabbits in your backyard!
I have my bumper sticker and yard signs still up as well!
I bought bumper stickers right before super Tuesday... still rocking it.
I love my ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a Warren Democrat‚Äô t-shirt and will wear it for as long as it fits me. I wore it for two days straight, from canvassing all day on Monday Super Tuesday eve, to her rally Monday night, to more canvassing on Super Tuesday. By the end of those 2 days, that t-shirt was able to stand up by itself in corner of a room, lol. But it‚Äôs now clean and sitting on the top of my t-shirt pile, ready to be worn again.  I will ALWAYS be a Warren Democrat. ‚ù§Ô∏èüá∫üá∏‚úåüèº
Someone stole my blue car magnet. üòï
Our primaries here in Georgia aren't until the 24th. ‚òπÔ∏è  My sign is staying up dammit!
T-Shirts too
Can we develop some cool Warren supporter handshake or sign? Saw two Warren supporters with a Warren bumper sticker on their car when I cross the street. I wanted to wave but do not have my Warren button with me and don't want to look like a freak that waves at them randomly...
That's a good observation! I wonder if they intentionally did that.   I bought a good number of merch already but am now looking for posters that are not on the shop, but am not having any luck.
Or, ya know when she becomes biden's VP and he dies in office from caronavirus or because he is old as dirt you can reuse it in 2024 when she is running again ;)
As long as you remember to donate next time!
I hope if she does run she continues the color theme. It's a good theme!  I'm banned from buying mugs but I got a Billionaire Tears sticker pack for my laptop and fridge, a tank top and a V neck T-shirt that when I vote symbolically for Warren in the NJ primaries and a *Value The wor of Black Women*  V neck tee for my mom or for myself because I'm sneaky like that. lol
Me as well, just ordered a shirt. I look forward go proudly wearing my Liz merch all the time.
Same.  Mine will be on my car until it's sold.
I really wish she would primary joe then if Bernie loses but unfortunately it seems unlikely. She‚Äôs just too kind and good to do something like that I feel like, even if she would beat the hell out of him and whatever weakling the gop puts up
That's cute.üíï
I‚Äôm in a Super Tuesday state and I haven‚Äôt taken down my yard signs yet. I just can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. And when I do, I‚Äôm just moving them from the front yard to the backyard. I still want to look at them forever, even if my neighbors aren‚Äôt!
"banned from buying mugs"   LOL!!
She's a fighter, and Joe will be *old* by then. Not impossible.
I've been there myself lmao
Yeah, this is one of my big gripes with the choices left: did anyone stop to ask "is either of these guys a 2-term president?"      Since the answer is "no", I will be looking forward to Warren 2024.
"Choose to fight only righteous fights..."
That video was something else, I gotta say.

Imagine what we could have had. Ugh.
I needed this today. üò≠‚úäüèº
This was the best thing to wake up to
If we have a contested convention by some miracle I will still support this woman for President.
I wanted her as president in 2016; 2020 confirmed that she would have been the best president in history.
happy cake day! keep fighting the good fight
lol this is cute and I love it
I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing no matter how many times I watched it.
Warren had some good dance moves... I didn‚Äôt think she had that in her toolbox
[removed]
Kate McKinnon was having so much trouble holding in her laugh üòÅ
[removed]
I'm reminded of Maya Rudolph's "you coulda had a bad bitch".
Bernie went to her in 2015 and urged her to run against Hillary. She turned it down, so he ran instead.  Edit: Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted. I‚Äôm not taking a position, merely supplying information...
Thanks!

Yes, she was and I thought that was funny, funnier than Elizabeth's dancing.
Not getting as much of Kate McKinnon's Elizabeth Warren character is certainly not the biggest loss with her dropping out of the race, but it might be the most underappreciated loss.  >Billionaires .... this ain't for yoooouuu.
She‚Äôs still younger than Biden and Sanders. If they did one term, she‚Äôll only be 74. That‚Äôs still younger than both candidates currently. I‚Äôm not including Gabbard since she‚Äôs been a nonfactor dot com.
She has to. Biden is a one-termer.  &#x200B;  Scenario 1:  &#x200B;  She runs and gets the DNC nom. She clearly was the best choice and if they back her, she and send Joe out to the pasture (He'll be 82 by Jan 2025), she wins.  &#x200B;  Scenario 2:  &#x200B;  We run an un-precedented write-in campaign to get her added as a write-in candidate in FL, NH, etc and DNC says "Oh crap. We're going to lose those states if we don't make her the nom." Then they force whoever has the nomination to step down and put her on.  &#x200B;  That's kind of how Trump won. He threatened to run 3p if he didn't get the nomination.  &#x200B;  Scenario 3:  &#x200B;  The Evan McMullin plan. We run an un-precedented write-in campaign to get her added as a write-in candidate in FL, NH, etc. Not enough to win 270, but hey, there was another former MA Senator, exactly 200 years before 2024 who became President without winning the Electoral College.  &#x200B;  In order for this to work, no one would win 270. McMullin's plan was to win UT and hope Clinton and Trump didn't reach 270 and the House would choose him.  &#x200B;  In order for this to work, it would be necessary to win 26 state delegations (see Amendment XII) by Dems and convince them she is better than whoever.  &#x200B;  In order to do that, you have to win state legislative and gubernatorial elections this year though, because next year is a redistricting year. Maps are frequently red because of the bloody of democracy shed by Republicans, carving up the country.
Presidential.
I recall. I suppose she knew, like Bernie did, that Hillary was the presumptive nominee.
> I‚Äôm not including Gabbard since she‚Äôs been a nonfactor dot com.  she's not really running in the race she's just...present
With healthcare for them how it is I'd be happy to call her President.
Borrowing ‚Äúnonfactor dot com‚Äù. Thanks.
you can tell which organizations are truly trying to be non-biased by the fact of wether or not they even acknowledge tulsi still exists
>McMullin's plan was to win UT and hope Clinton and Trump didn't reach 270 and the House would choose him.  I have several family members who voted for McMullin.  I think he would've received quite a lot more votes if people hadn't picked up on a rumor that his mom is gay, or maybe he's gay, but there was a definite gay vibe to him and that made him unsafe.  Hillary Clinton has been well-established as a minion of Satan, so that's how Trump won Utah even though everyone purported to hate him.  They've changed their minds and forgiven him though, because Republicans.    Utah is a fun state to live in, and by fun I mean absolutely insane politically and in many other ways.
Not only that, but she genuinely did not want to be President then. She felt someone ought to have more experience first.
I have a theory she‚Äôs running for a Fox News position.
I mean, Yang got on CNN so it‚Äôs not unbelievable
I mean, CNN is practically Fox News anyway.   There‚Äôs not much of a difference between a neoliberal propaganda machine like CNN and a Republican outlet like Fox. At least Fox is honest about it.  We all knew Yang was Republican. And Warren was a Republican so who‚Äôs surprised she‚Äôs going back to helping the establishment watch people die?!  And did you know Nancy Pelosi is secretly an alien?
THE GOVERNMENT ARE LIZARD PEOPLE
Bernie can help you find the lizards *and* the zombies who live amongst us!  Vote now for the... Bernie-nator.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be back... for your taxes and votes. He‚Äôs not sure what he‚Äôll do with them but he‚Äôll do... stuff.‚Äù
He‚Äôs feeding our tax dollars to the aliens in Area 51
"NEW: @JoeBiden's campaign confirms that he has reviewed @ewarren‚Äôs bankruptcy plan closely, and is endorsing her proposal, as he said in his IL town hall."
From the tweet:   ...JoeBiden's campaign confirms that he has reviewed  ewarren‚Äôs bankruptcy plan closely, and is endorsing her proposal, as he said in his IL town hall.  That's a significant shift, as the proposal would largely undo the 2005 bankruptcy bill the two clashed over in Congress.
Obama adopted some of Warren's proposals.  Next best thing to Warren in the WH is Warren's ideas in the WH.
I forgot to mention, there's a petition going to get Biden to add Warren's plans to his platform: https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/sign-our-letter-to-vice-president-biden-we-have-some-plans-for-that  Please sign!
I was about to post this here!!  I think Warren becomes the most influential Senator in America if Biden wins. I don‚Äôt think he meant it as a jab that he needs her in the Senate. Can you imagine Warren as Senate Majority Leader??
Yay it‚Äôs happening!! This is so great to see. I really appreciate him doing this.  I know Kamala is going to be VP but this just got my hopes up for a Biden-Warren ticket :)
YAAAAAAASSSSS!!!!!
And THIS leverage to push progressive policy with the likely winner is exactly what she didn't want to lose by endorsing the other guy. Pragmatics get stuff done.
For reference, Warren's plan for bankruptcy reform: https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/bankruptcy-reform
Further proof that progress happens from hard work and unity, rather than vitriol and divisiveness.
Nice! I'm on Team Joe these days, because I can read the writing on the wall, but I am hoping he finds his way to embracing at least some of Warren's politics. So this is nice to see.
Leverage at work!! EW never sleeps.
Great first step. Next, climate change, anticorruption, the wealth tax, and immigration. Oh and hey, while you‚Äôre at, stick her on the ticket.
<3 The Dems need to work together to get shit done!
Keeping my Biden/Warren 2020 dreams alive!
This is awesome
Boom. I suspect there are some negotiations going on and Warren is getting policy concessions such as this. It's a good thing, folks.
Here's to hoping he wins and calls it after one term. Warren 2024 is now our best chance at a true progressive who's completely on top of her stuff.  For now, this is awesome to see.
BIG tent.
Would you guys want Warren as a VP? Good idea or not? I'd absolutely support it.
r/neoliberal user here (someone shared with us)  This is how moderates and progressives should get along.
I'm really happy about this.
To the left, to the left Withhold your endorsement Till he moves to the left
I'm sure Elizabeth Warren would love nothing more then for Joe Biden to incorporate some of her plans into his platform. I'm curious to see if it'll come into fruition.
Dope!!
Now, that's awesome
Lmaoo and all the Bernie supporters insisted she wouldn‚Äôt be able to change his mind on policy. If he can budge on this I‚Äôm sure Warren would make an eloquent and pragmatic case for M4All that he would adopt into his platform
I think what I really like about Biden is that he isn‚Äôt afraid to adopt other proposals. He said in a speech ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bridge to the future.‚Äù I truly believe he means that and he‚Äôs going to use his presidency as a means of building up the next political generation and not being so stubborn to think he has all the answers
This is a promising move.  I don't know if it's an organic choice, or something that Warren negotiated as a requirement for an endorsement.  I suspect the latter, since she used her leverage to move Hillary leftward in 2016, and this year she's even more influential.  Joe is set to widen the delegate lead dramatically after the next batch of states, so I wouldn't be surprised to find her endorsing him afterwards.  Originally I thought she'd hold out until the April 28th primaries, but with the coronavirus crisis in full swing, I think we're going to see a lot more incentive to unify sooner rather than later.
That IS big. I hoped something like this would happen--that Liz would stay in long enough (after it was clear she was going to fly short) to get her policies and ideas into the conversation.
I dunno, maybe he feels less beholden to banks now that he's no longer DE's senator?
We have to hold his feet to the fire on this. He has every reason to endorse this right now and make it an absurdly low priority as president
>the proposal would largely undo the 2005 bankruptcy bill the two clashed over in Congress.  This highlights both the best and worst of a Biden presidency.  He responds to incentive, but sometimes a little too well.
Hey there‚Äôs an open letter a bunch of the warren volunteer leaders created asking for this. You can read it [here](https://medium.com/@dreambigfighton/open-letter-to-vice-president-biden-51a3eecd3fe3) and sign of you feel inclined. I think there are some places where his policy is lacking and her plans would be perfect.
she wont be the nominee but if at least some of her plans are done ill be happy
Done so already.  Keep bringing it to people's attention, thanks!
I‚Äôm imaging a Warren / Pelosi wonder twins powers activate sequence now‚Ä¶
This is a fight I think we can win.  The senate can't stand on tenure, because if it rewards on who was there the longest, it excludes women and POC.
I hadn't thought about that before.. Warren and Pelosi do have similar levels of attention to detail, tenacity and boldness
Yeah I know full well it‚Äôll be Harris but I really think Warren is a much better prospect for generating enthusiasm among the grassroots progressives and suburban women and he‚Äôs going to need it.
Kamala will do some good though.  And she and Warren have each other's back.  So I can see Kamala and Liz partnering together to get things done.
I'd be surprised if he didn't pick someone from the midwest since those are going to be the most important states. California is on lock.
Kamala chance is relatively high but one thing it would fail to do is bring in red states   I wish Val Demings had a little more Gov experience cause she is super impressive
Kamala is a disappointing choice. Whenever anyone criticizes her, she resorts to the same ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve done‚Äù speech. Wasn‚Äôt she the main person attacking Biden in the debates?
Thanks for the link.  Reading through, I'm a little disappointed there is no addressing personal chapter 11s, or commercial entities that use the 11 structure in a liquidation that spins off assets that harms some creditors more than others.  Also think the trustees ought have standing for debt collection claims(or even allow US trustees to bring class action), as they'll likely have more resources than the individual (though, the debtor ought still see benefit)
This. I also like seeing her take a couple days off and then getting back to work. She‚Äôs still an influential Senator and could be Senate Majority Leader in 2021
Sanders has in some ways hurt the progressive left within the Democratic Party by giving people the idea that you **had** to aggressively run against the Democratic Party as an institution. And if you didn't that meant you were an establishment sellout.  Instead, people like Warren, Pramilla Jayapal, Katie Porter, Ed Markey, and I'd argue even AOC to some extent have shown far more ability to actually drive change by understanding the need to work within the party.
Ding ding ding!  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!
It's also worth noting that Biden is doing all this *without* Warren's endorsement of his campaign - he's proving that Warren is more effective pushing Biden to the left than latching on to Bernie's dead campaign trying to delay the inevitable.
[removed]
I'm rooting for Joe because I think he can drive turnout among older Democrats much better than Bernie can. And older voters are an enormous block. If Bernie can't win their support, he's got no shot.
I see a lot of "but she would be useless", and to a degree I agree, but I think she could have a lot more influence than we realize.  I found this article interesting and enlightening.  https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/inside-the-race-to-win-over-elizabeth-warren.html  Particularly this part.    "As Clinton approached the presidency, and considered Warren as a potential running mate, the senator made plans to shape the new administration‚Äôs appointments, drawing up lists of recommended hires and unacceptable nominees. If there was one thing that mattered to her, the senator‚Äôs team insisted, it was being able to influence the new White House‚Äôs policy ‚Äî and, as she often said, personnel is policy."
I‚Äôve been wavering because it‚Äôs difficult to argue against a WOC on the ticket when his nomination is owed to black voters but yeah, this. Disaffected younger voters aren‚Äôt going to read the platform 5 months from now and decide to volunteer because he‚Äôs adopted her bankruptcy plans (and may yet go back on it if he wins) The VP is the most visible concession he can make and he should do it.
I want him to adopt Warren's electoral and voting reform plan next: https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-plan-to-strengthen-our-democracy-6867ec1bcd3c  >**Federal elections get state-of-the-art federal machines, federal ballots, and federal security.** Right now some jurisdictions use dated machines that are easily hackable with no paper trail. Ballot design is all over the place. No more. The federal government will replace every voting machine in the country with state-of-the-art equipment and require adoption of a uniform federal ballot. And we will lock all federal voting technology systems behind a security firewall like it‚Äôs Fort Knox.   >**Federal standards for federal elections.** We have 8,000 election jurisdictions running elections. Problems with resources, malfeasance, and errors are rampant. No more. We will have federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, including mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. My plan will mean no more arbitrary voter purges. No more registration issues. And no more gerrymandering. We will also make Election Day a holiday to make it easier for people to get to the polls.  >**Enforce the law and expand access ‚Äî through incentives where possible, and with federal authority where necessary.** My plan will give states cutting-edge voting equipment and election security protocols, all paid for by the federal government, and states will be required to follow all federal standards for federal elections. States who also choose to meet these requirements in their state elections can work through federal-state partnership agreements to have those elections fully funded by the federal government, too ‚Äî and we‚Äôll give them a bonus for achieving high voter turnout rates. And where racist or corrupt politicians refuse to follow the law, the federal government will temporarily take over the administration of their federal elections to guarantee the fundamental right to vote.
>Next, climate change  Biden [already supports the Green New Deal](https://joebiden.com/climate/).
I think Biden is probably already pro immigration reform.  I think he is open to appointing an attorney general whose mandate will be anti corruption and criminal justice reform.  I'm hoping Preet Bharara.  The wealth tax?  I don't know.  Maybe Warren can push it through congress and the Biden is put on the spot.  It should be adopted as it's hugely popular with voters across the political spectrum.
Makes sense.  2005 he‚Äôs the senator representing the state that is one of the most bank and corporate friendly states in the country. Now he has 8 years of VP experience in the Obama administration and 4 years of experience as a citizen under Trump. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if he has adjusted his views to the betterment of the nation rather than simply the betterment of his state.
This was my thought as well; that Delaware is all about catering to corporations since that is the place where almost all major corporations incorporate b/c of the favorable laws.  This is what some on the left don't get; Biden is malleable on some issues (he isn't frozen in time).  He is still deeply flawed and we won't get everything we want, but if anyone can get concessions from him, it's Warren.  I suspect that her campaign is in talks with his and negotiating what it will take for her to endorse him.  This is what Bernie's campaign SHOULD be doing, but I'm doubtful that they are.
Good point. DE is one of the largest tax havens in the world and needs a serious rewrite of many of their financial laws.
Idk man he‚Äôs still funded by those same banks right now. I think it‚Äôs probably more just that Elizabeth warren is the perfect person for the job and he needs an olive branch to progressives.
A mid-election hint of a proposal versus an actual bill being voted on.   The same banks are still fueling his campaign.
I'd go with his ideas are outdated and he wants to be president.
Someone that responds to incentive means they are at least, influence-able.
I agree
Warren is 100 times as bold as Pelosi. Liz called for a biggest changes to the country in half a century. In Nancy's 2 speakerships she's been rhetorically and theatrically strong but constantly caves to GOP on policy. This week's paid sick leave bill is a prime example.
Imagine Harris and Warren practicing for the VP debates together. Warren as Harris's cut man? Mike Pence is about to get Bloomed down. And Harris can already do her own take downs.
Could be Kamala, but there‚Äôs also the [short list](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/23/joe-biden-possible-vice-president-stacey-abrams-sally-yates/4284126002/) he gave back in November (Sally Yates, Stacey Abrams, Jeanne Shaheen, Maggie Hassan).  Of those, only Abrams would fit with Clyburn/the CBC‚Äôs suggestion.  But I get the feeling that whether it‚Äôs Kamala, Abrams, Liz, the others on his old short list (for reasons I don‚Äôt get) or some other pick, someone will be disappointed. I don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs a unicorn pick we‚Äôre not seeing.
Is this like a given?
I highly doubt she will be Majority Leader. That, as ever, is a question of seniority and after Schumer, Durbin is next in line.  That said, you don't have to be majority/minority leader or whip to be incredibly influential, and who better to be the next "liberal lion of Massachusetts" than the one currently holding Ted Kennedy's old seat?
I don't know how she'd convince a majority of the caucus to back her. Maybe 20 current Senators are progressive. Most of them are average liberals or center-left moderates. I think most of the candidates we're relying on to flip the Senate are also liberal-to-moderate. Kelly, Bullock, Hickenlooper, etc aren't lefty progressives.
Here's hoping.
Sanders didn't do everything well, but on balance he has been a tremendous help to the progressive left. He's a great moral leader if not a political leader. He articulated a moral argument for progressivism to a degree it hadn't been in generations, which is necessary to gaining public support for policies.  You're right that we're going to have to look toward other politicians to actually become the dominant political force within the party, and the reason why is a list of Bernie Sanders's personal flaws, but in the wake of his two runs: the number of progressive congress members soared, progressive candidates began running for office at every level, support for progressive policies among voters under 45 was galvanized, online grassroots fundraising proved to be a viable way to fund a post-Citizens United presidential campaign, and the tent got bigger with inroads to politically neglected or dormant communities across the country, including Native American, Muslim and Latino communities. That's the lasting impact for progressives. The base is bigger now, so we're in the ballgame in any open primary if our candidates can capitalize on those gains.
I honestly didn't believe you, but it's true: https://joebiden.com/climate/  > Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.
At the very least, Biden supports the Paris Climate Accord, which is a *big* improvement over Trump.
Exactly. As a ‚Äúclimate first‚Äù voter, shifting to Biden when Warren dropped out was a no-brainer.
Removed. Sorry but we don't allow any form of Bernie Bros per Rule 4. If you want to edit that out of your comment then reply to this comment, I will reapprove your comment. Thanks.
And Biden helps down ticket races; it's as important that we take back the senate, maintain or increase our numbers in the House, but also the state legislatures and governorships.  I have so  much more hope now than I did; mainly because of how well Biden performed in Michigan; showing that the Obama coalition and working class white men to some extent are going to show up and vote for Biden.
After Liz got vetted for the VP slot one of Clinton‚Äôs most senior advisors told her that if he had a crystal ball and could tell her that Liz wouldn‚Äôt be a pain in the ass for 4 years, it would be the ticket that would help her most in the general because she had a weakness on the left flank. Hillary went for loyalty and Virginia instead and well, we saw what happened there. I hope Biden took notes.  And Liz managed to torpedo the odious Larry Summer‚Äôs lifelong dream of running the Fed from the Senate floor despite him having been an Obama mainstay, so I can‚Äôt imagine she wouldn‚Äôt be able to do *something* about personnel from the VP position.
She would be both very useful and pretty much a lock for the 2024 nomination assuming Biden is only one term. I'm totally on board the VP Warren train.
Yup. Saying he‚Äôll do these things is fine, but he has an extremely large trust issue. The best way for him to prove he‚Äôs not bluffing (and I suspect he is, at the moment) is to put an actual progressive who believes in those ideals a heartbeat from the Presidency.
I'm a Warren supporter. As much as I'd love to see her on the ticket, it's important she stay in the senate so she's not replaced by a republican. Tammy Baldwin for VP could be a good pick.
It's a bit damned if you do and damned if you don't.
I‚Äôm hoping Stacey Abrams for AG, actually. I really want to see her do well, she‚Äôs qualified, and she deserves to have a place in the administration, given her invaluable work with Fair Fight.
The 2008 financial crisis changed the way a lot of people look at the financial sector, I think Joe Biden is one of those people
I‚Äôm sure bernies campaign reached out and asked for an endorsement. I just think liz kinda already knew who she thought was gonna win and didn‚Äôt wanna hitch her trailer to the wrong horse.
Bernie did this with Hillary right before the convention in order to produce the "Most progressive agenda" for the administration. Something Warren worked on since 2014. So its possible for Bernie to do so, but hopefully he does it earlier.
Was Pelosi the one to water that down? üòÆ
Apart from that first debate, Harris was oddly disappointing to me in debates. She allowed herself to be exposed by fricking Tulsi. It was so strange that she wasn‚Äôt prepared at all to defend her AG record- she had to know it was coming. But her takedowns of Sessions and Kavanaugh show she‚Äôs definitely got it in her. Maybe she just needed a smaller field to shine.
Nope, the ideal pick is a progressive WOC from a swing state (but doesn‚Äôt risk a Senate seat) with enough experience to do the job from day 1 who is also a proven campaigner and debater.   This person doesn‚Äôt exist, so it becomes a question of priorities.
It‚Äôs not set in stone just yet, but...  - Clyburn and the CBC have publicly called for a black woman, so it‚Äôs going to be difficult to go in another direction  - Kamala hinted hard at it in a recent talk she did and Joe‚Äôs team have also hinted on social media  - The major Democratic donors funding the general like Kamala and don‚Äôt particularly like Liz for obvious reasons  - Joe gave a TV interview last week where he said he wants a VP who is aligned with him on issues   The only way I see him changing his mind is if their internal numbers convince him that the generational gap would hurt him badly in November and the only way to remedy that is with a progressive or if the economy collapses very soon and he needs her for that
I think she‚Äôs detailed enough to get policy through.  I want someone progressive that can get something across the line and passed.
He was a help in 2016 perhaps. In 2020 he both held the movement back and broke it apart. His shitty campaign culture split progressives and alienated Warren. His factional campaign strategy was predicated on a hostile takeover in a crowded campaign and it flopped. The uncompromising nature of the campaign prevented it from growing and also made anyone who wanted to compromise or have a more gradual theory of sustainable change seem like a neoliberal right wing sellout or whatever.
What has he actually helped? Be specific.

I'm here for the Dick Cheney of the left. She even blasted a rich guy in the face already.
This is definitely a good first step, but it also reads as a signal to Bernie to drop already and Liz to hurry up and endorse. I hope she holds out for longer. At least get her anti corruption plans in. And her disability plan- I know she‚Äôs really proud of that one and Biden doesn‚Äôt even have a disability plan.   If he doesn‚Äôt pick a progressive, it‚Äôs hard not to read any of his shift left as posturing. And he‚Äôs really going to need enthusiasm in the fall. Fear of Trump might get him over the line anyway, but I‚Äôd rather not risk it.
But she wouldn‚Äôt be replaced by a Republican. There‚Äôs not a chance in hell that that seat flips. It‚Äôs literally D+30.   Tammy Baldwin, on the other hand‚Äî her seat could very well flip; Wisconsin can and will turn red and stay red, including for Senate seats. Ex. Ron Johnson.
Baldwin, Duckworth, Klobuchar or Abrams seem like the most likely choices. Someone who will help make gains in the Midwest or open up the South a bit.  I'd rather see Liz as Treasury Secretary.
That would be a good idea!
I'll believe it when I see it.
Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs positive message is shoring up support for whoever the Democratic nominee is. 90% of her supporters promise to support the nominee with 0% saying they wouldn‚Äôt, higher than any candidate.
I'm a volunteer texter and one of the text leaders suggested we say "thanks for being an active voter" when we've reached the natural conclusion of a convo with someone who has a different preferred candidate. I love this closing message.
Some on Reddit call this a weakness. I think it is proof that she is running a good campaign that is free of mudslinging and disingenuous attacks.  We all may have a different order of who we would vote for after Warren, but all of us know that the end goal is beating Trump.
This is why I love Warren. She's able to balance big structural change (tm) with pragmatism. This ethos trickles down to her supporters.
Here is data grabbed and formatted from the part of the poll referenced in the title of this post:  [**Emerson College Polling (Jan 21 - 23)**](https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/national-2020-biden-and-sanders-battle-in-two-way-race-for-democratic-nomination)  "Will you vote for the Democratic nominee even if it is not your candidate / candidate supporters?"  M.O.E. = 2.8%  |*Supporter's 1st Choice Candidate*|*"Yes"*|*"No"*|*"Depends on who"*| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Warren**|90%|**0%**|10%| |**Biden**|87%|**5%**|9%| |**Buttigieg**|86%|**0%**|14%| |**Bloomberg**|78%|**11%**|11%| |**Sanders**|53%|**16%**|31%| |**Yang**|50%|**42%**|9%|  [***Additionally, here is a more detailed breakdown from the same poll of how theoretical candidate match-ups vs. Trump would cause these voter blocks to vote.***](https://imgur.com/gallery/lEBrvWj)  *Note that there are some weirdos in the poll, like 1 Warren supporter says they would vote for Trump instead of... Warren?*
If ranked choice voting was nationwide, I'm pretty sure she'd win the nomination. I feel like she's everyone's second choice at worse
We're the team players.
I firmly believe she would be the best leader for our country at this moment for exactly this reason - among others.
I love this, I think it‚Äôs so much to do with Elizabeth‚Äôs style and her refusal to damage the party. I hope with all my heart she wins, but this is so important.  In the spirit of positivity I‚Äôm not using the site‚Äôs actual headline, but it is an important distinction. To be a leading candidate and only have 53% of your supporters loyal to the nominee is a dangerous sign, and while I think Bernie is overwhelmingly positive about supporting the nominee I wish his supporters and surrogates didn‚Äôt enforce such a dangerous echo chamber which threatens any future where he doesn‚Äôt win.  16% vowing not to vote for the nominee is shameful.
I'm caucusing for Warren in Iowa Monday, but I'll vote for a potato in the general if it's got a D carved in it.
While results vary a lot depending on polls, and I think numbers will change a lot after the primary, these are very good numbers
>90% of her supporters promise to support the nominee with 0% saying they wouldn‚Äôt, higher than any candidate.  At least in this regard, it sounds like Warren supporters are leading by example! Hopefully we can keep this up.
This is awesome. Tho take note that Pete supporters also have a 0% for no.
I hate any supporters of any candidate who will allow another four years of Trump. We should all be on the same page here!!!
Very cool how proud some Berners are of this: [https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/eu4n9l/bernie\_or\_bust\_is\_strong\_and\_scaring\_the/?sort=confidence](https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/eu4n9l/bernie_or_bust_is_strong_and_scaring_the/?sort=confidence)
That's a great vibe.
dropping by to say hell yeah I'm gonna vote for the dem nominee
Yet the rabid wing of Sanders supporters seem to attack anyone who is not for him. They really paint a bad image for Bernie
I'm a Bernie supporter, but I REALLY appreciate Warren's campaign and her supporters. She's definitely my 2nd choice.

This doesn't make sense to me as being a good thing. Doesn't it mean that Warren, more than anyone else is least capable of bringing in non-voters or disenchanted Trump supporters?
It's time for the Biden supporters who say 'blue no matter who' to put up or shut up. One way or the other, a progressive is going to win this race.
Aren‚Äôt you guys playing to win? This is not a positive
[deleted]
So you have no values then? You just want the right colored team to win, regardless of what they actually do once in office. I mean sure, if that‚Äôs all politics is to you, but maybe we can actually strive for something more specific to happen than just stopping the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù
Warms my ‚ù§Ô∏è
Only on reddit can the ability to raise a diverse coalition be a negative thing...
Couldn‚Äôt agree more!
And getting Warren‚Äôs plans enacted, regardless of who is POTUS.
Not *just* beating Trump -- Big Structural Change.
Agreed! When I was volunteering in Iowa over summer everyone I was with in Polk County were so positive, and genuinely meant it. When we‚Äôd go out or have drinks, the times when peoples guards are down, I still only ever heard polite criticisms of candidates but a great respect and willingness to vote for every one of them.  From Elizabeth to her campaign directors to organisers to volunteers, then out to voters. Positivity spreads!
Absolutely. The point I always articulate is "The Tone at the Top", which is the central theme of the book about the Enron scandal, *The Smartest Men in the Room*. It's this idea that however leadership presents itself morally and ethically will percolate all the way down in an organization. It's absolutely true, and Warren is the embodiment of that theme at its best.  The book is a fantastic read, and I encourage everyone to take the time to read it!
More like supporters with that ethos have been flocking to Warren.  She's answering a need, not supplying motivation.  We haven't discovered pragmatism, we've just found a truly pragmatic progressive candidate and THAT is a powerful rallying force.

Apart from 53% "Yes" from Sanders, that whopping 42% of "No" from Yang makes me sad.
Thank you! On mobile so I couldn‚Äôt actually do this myself. 42% no from Yang is genuinely quite upsetting, but I suppose he has actually attracted some republican support.   It‚Äôs arguably a lot less important despite a higher % though, since 42% of his supporters is still quite a bit less than Bernie‚Äôs 16%.  16% of Bernie‚Äôs support now is essentially a 3.4% bleed from all primary voters, and that‚Äôs without including all of the ‚Äòit depends‚Äô (can you see even half of those voting for Biden?).  We need a coordinated push from *entire* campaigns and supporters to be more ‚Äòvote blue no matter who‚Äô, not just candidates.
The Sanders situation is a good example of my issues with his most zealous support base.  I keep reading over and over again that if Bernie doesn't win the nomination, that's all the evidence they need to know it was rigged against him.  It's the exact same language, faulty logic, and binary thinking that we heard from Trump supporters back in 2016 when it looked like he was going to lose the election.  I don't intend to disparage him; he moved on and supported the nominee in 2016, it's just the supporters who lingered in conspiracy and resentment.  The idea that after the past four years of this administration that any supporter of any DNC candidate could consider sitting out the election is ludicrous.  Hell, if they nominated Mitt Romney or Jeb Bush as the DNC nominee I'd put up a lawn sign for them at this point.    2020 is a national referendum on whether or not we want to remain a constitutional republic or not, and my most or least favored candidate winning the nomination is a secondary concern.
It seems a lot of the Yang people are actually Trumpets or conservatives.  I‚Äôm really not sure about his supporters
She would definitely win
Is this a Warren policy?
https://morningconsult.com/2020-democratic-primary/   Is she though.? Maybe for sanders supporters. The rest, no.
I don‚Äôt know... She would need enough Buttigieg, Yang, Klobachar and Bloomberg voters to put her high enough to surpass sanders.  Going by the current average there are 9 points between her and sanders.    There are currently about 24 points shared between those in 4-8.  I can see at least half going to biden.  So warren would need sanders to only get 1/12 of those votes and her to get the rest.  There is still 15 percent who is either not committed or supporting an even more minor candidate and they could break her way.  But that is no way guaranteed and I‚Äôm going to ignore them.  So after that biden is sitting at about 40 and warren at about 26.  She would then need to get about 80 percent of Sanders voters to support her to get her to just of 41.    I‚Äôm not including some of the voters not committed to the top 8 and I have been rounding but I just wanted to highlight that it wouldn‚Äôt be quite guaranteed at all.  There are lots of points where she could not get enough votes and have to have her votes redistributed.   The thing with preferential voting is that it doesn‚Äôt really help you if you have lots of second choice support among candidates that are more popular then you are in first preference votes.  Which isn‚Äôt a bad thing necessarily- it would mean that libertarians would win basically every election where no one gets 50 percent otherwise.

I have, on more than one occasion here, had one of his supporters essentially try to extort support for him, arguing--with a straight face--that while anyone else's supporters would vote for whoever wins, his might not so if I didn't want Trump to win, I should support Sanders in the primary.  I was literally told that not supporting Sanders was the equivalent of supporting Trump.  It was disgusting and infuriating and--I imagine--not something Sanders would want to hear. But I think that's what happens when you don't have strong leadership at the top with messaging to supporters coupled with near-vilification of the competition.
You know, as primarily a Sanders supporter (though Warren is my clear #2), I think the people likely to break for him are both pissed off at the status quo and unhappy about the ethics of how the DNC behaved in 2016, and so may make these statements out of frustration / a warning to party elites. However, back in 2016, over 85% of Sanders supporters broke for Clinton. Could have been higher, but compare it to the less than 75% of 2008 Clinton supporters who broke for Obama (with 25% going for McCain, vs 12% of Sanders supporters going for Trump), so that‚Äôs actually better than recent history. I don‚Äôt imagine the numbers would look too different this time.  All that said, the Warren supporters polled here should be praised for that attitude, and we should work to foster it in the supporters of other candidates, including my own fellow Sanders supporters.
It's sort of ironic though that Biden supporters constantly argue that Biden appeals to conservative Democrats who would never vote for Bernie, and then they use that as a reason to support Biden: "His voters won't vote for Bernie. Therefore Biden is our best chance to beat Trump." And that is received by the establishment as a legitimate reason for Biden's nomination.  But then when it is reported Bernie supporters won't support Biden if he is the nominee, everyone jumps on Bernie and his supporters, as despicable people, as not real Democrats, etc.  Using that same logic that Biden's fans argue, it is actually a strong reason to vote for Bernie. That is IF the most important goal is in to ultimately defeat Trump.
Potatoes haven't done anything to anyone, except exist, feed us, get fermented to give us  vodka, and love us.   ... Except for that time they did not exist, which was problematic for my ancestors I'll admit.  Potato 2020, if for some reason every American but Trump is abducted by aliens.
Thank you, on both fronts!
I was canvasing in NH for Warren this past weekend and the people who had Pete in their top consideration seemed to be very friendly and open to other ideas.  Aside from the Warren supporters they were my favorite to talk to.
Honestly I have never seen that sub before and it is honestly terrifying, why are they proud of wasting their day writing in a candidate that isn‚Äôt running if he doesn‚Äôt win
Holy shit that sub is terrifying. T_D turned blue.
My biggest turnoff of Bernie by far is how psychotic some of his supporters are. It's scary. Love Bernie to pieces but I wish he'd try a little harder to reign in the extremists.
He was an independent so it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that he appeals to a wide arrange of voters. Independents vote on who the candidate is and not the party. This shouldn‚Äôt be surprising or scary.

Not sure who downvoted you for asking a question.  Not at all! All it means is her supporters are committed to any nominee. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean she‚Äôs not bringing in new voters (quite the contrary according to some polls I‚Äôve been diving into recently) or trump supporters, but that whoever she is bringing in (primary wise) is committed to the fight.  A lot of her policies are very favoured by a lot of independents and republicans, you just need to remember those with greater name recognition (Bernie and Biden) will have more pull among Republicans and Independents because those factions don‚Äôt follow detailed policy in democratic primaries, they only know surface info, like Warren is a liberal elite from Massachusetts. Once they learn who she really is, where she comes from, what she‚Äôs fighting for, I don‚Äôt doubt she‚Äôll gain a lot of their support.
What? Primary voting hasn't even started.
This is a perfect example of how not to react.  Not every candidate can win the primary. Fostering die intense support is good, but support that‚Äôs *exclusive to you* is selfish and just endangering our fight to beat Trump just so a candidate can keep a percentage of two more in the primary.   It‚Äôs selfish to promote, and I‚Äôm proud of Elizabeth for not doing it.
I‚Äôm sure she wouldn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt worry! They‚Äôre good friends, they both knew they were going to enter the race and they both know this is just business.   There‚Äôs a strong chance she gets picked for Veep too if he wins. He wouldn‚Äôt be researching whether to give her a top cabinet position *and the vice presidency* if he didn‚Äôt still have immense respect for her.
I don‚Äôt see where you‚Äôre coming from with this.  I have values, Elizabeth aligns most with them by far. Closely followed by Bernie, and if you go by their policies, weirdly Steyer. As I keep saying though, the benefit to Warren is minuscule and the danger to the general *huge* if every candidate had support numbers like Bernie‚Äôs.  Not sure how that‚Äôs difficult for you to grasp. I want Warren to win badly. I spent *two months* of my life volunteering 5 days a week to that end. That doesn‚Äôt mean I condone risking leaving Trans and minority Americans discriminated against and disenfranchised, or abortion rights in peril, or another conservative justice on the Supreme Court *just to give Warren a tiny extra edge in the primary*.
Well considering a lot of them are saying unless you're a progressive socialist you're really a Republican. So...
"The Smartest Guys in the Room". The movie version is well done, as well.
OTOH, it looks like we may be be in for a long fight. As less popular candidates drop out, it will benefit Warren most. She will continue to accumulate delegates and is well positioned for a convention fight.  She can win. [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-why-the-warren-sanders-fight-may-help-warrens-chances-in-iowa/) put her chances at 63% of winning if she takes Iowa followed by Buttigieg, and Sanders, with Biden finishing fourth.  OTOH, finishing second to Buttigieg in the best case drops her chances to 17%. Of course Trump had a 15% chance of winning on election night, so that‚Äôs not nothing.  Warren is the best candidate by far and we need to keep her accumulating delegates until it‚Äôs a 3 person race. I think she‚Äôll be in a strong position by then.
I honestly think Bernie has reached his ceiling. Where else is there for him to go but down? Literally every candidate's second choice is Liz, sans Yang iirc.  I think she just needs to get over the 15% hump and that'll get augmented by the post-threshold count and then see where the race stands.
If Sanders becomes President I can seriously see her becoming part of his Cabinet.
A generous and optimistic interpretation would be: "*Yang attracts a non-traditional base who would not typically vote for ANY Democrats, and in his absence those 42% would be R-voters or non-voters.*"  Regardless, this poll should be a sign that moving forwards it is very important for Yang to strongly and repeatedly advocate for the Democratic nominee to his supporters (assuming that it is not him). I think he is a good dude so I have faith that he will do so.
Really not surprising either.
It's not that surprising.  Bernie and Yang have a lot of non-democrat and/or anti-establishment supporters.   Regardless of the outcome of this election, the Democratic party really needs to reevaluate itself and how it can do more to appeal to those voters. Clearly they find something appealing about progressive policy but are unwilling to toe the party line.
Yang is a libertarian running on the Democratic ticket. He is draw attention from a non-traditional demographic (and the anti male circumcision crowd.)  Sanders "depends on who" and no percentages should be disconcerting considering the scorched earth slandering of all other candidates his surrogates engage in.
>We need a coordinated push from entire campaigns and supporters to be more ‚Äòvote blue no matter who‚Äô, not just candidates.  I'd like to see this too. It's really troubling how even candidates are starting to publicly back away from this position.
> can you see even half of those voting for Biden?  27% of Sanders' supporters listed their second choice as Biden based on the last poll I read. It's perfectly possible that "it depends" means they're really into voting for "crotchety old man" energy and don't want to vote for some conniving she-devil who doesn't know her place.*  *not my opinion
Or left libertarians. My brother falls roughly into this camp. Bernie was his guy in 2016, and he's been actively supporting Yang in this cycle.  Many are strongly hostile to neoliberalism and that means 'no' to Biden, Klobuchar, and probably Buttigieg as well.  I'm firmly in the pro-Warren camp as I believe she can unite more of the Democratic party while still being progressive. Low voter turnout on our side would truly doom the country, and that seems to be the weapon of choice to divide us, *even by our own kin.*
I've decided that, since I'm in a later state, I'm going to be voting for whoever is ahead out of either Warren or Sanders. I love both candidates but my main goal is to have a progressive win over Biden. Getting over 50% of the delegates is really important because I have no faith that superdelegates won't overturn the results on the second ballot if a progressive has the plurality but not the majority.
It's been passed statewide in Maine recently, and is in effect in several sizable municipalities in other states. Many people think it would be more equitable and less corruptible.
Would require a constitutional amendment nationally, or at least to update the laws in individual states for the primaries i think.
why do you think she lied?
Ugh she didn't lie üôÑ
I've also felt extorted by this positioning by the Sanders base, and in one-on-one interactions with a few of them, it has been explicitly threatened that a huge portion of his base will vote for Trump if Sanders is not the nominee.
I don‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists.
And this is why I would be hesitant to vote for Sanders even in the general election. After how his supporters acted the last election and continue to divide Democrats and refuse to vote, I am not sure I could in good conscience vote for him even if he won the primary.  I see Sanders and his base to be the left's equivalent of Trump - filled with rhetoric, anger, and an irrational cult of personality.  Now Sanders himself isn't as bad, but I am terrified it will unleash a radical left movement, not unlike what Trump's created. More importantly, as with all crazies, rational thought and policy-making will be out the window, replaced by populist actions.  Sanders' woefully inadequate knowledge of business and banking could actually be disastrous for the economy. Unlike Warren, who has a plan for everything, Sanders makes angry outrageous statements with very little in the way of how he'll make things happen.  The sad reality is that if the choice if Sanders or Trump, I'll sit this one out. Or hell, move to Melbourne with my Aussie wife.
If the most important goal is to defeat Trump then *Elizabeth Warren* should be the person everyone votes for.  She is whip-smart, she is passionate, she is pragmatic, and she doesn't shout in hyperbole that turns off moderates. She is a coalition-builder and she *gets shit done.*  I'm tired of all the fucking yelling and I imagine most voters are as well and aren't interested in exchanging one old man yelling at everyone for another.
So Warren, who is largely acceptable to both camps should be the nominee then.
Perhaps, but from what we can see in Iowa right now, Bernie‚Äôs becoming more and more polarising, and there is a fairly substantial never-Bernie block there now.   You‚Äôre right that it is perhaps a reason to vote Bernie if viewed in the way you suggest, but when you place it in context of Biden vs Trump it‚Äôs clearly not ideological, it‚Äôs a fanatical refusal to compromise in any way that doesn‚Äôt bode well.  For what it‚Äôs worth, these 16% are saying no to *any nominee*, which includes those who are strongly ideologically aligned with Bernie (like Warren, Yang, or to an extent Steyer).
Because there's no logical reason for so-called "progressives" to not vote for the most progressive candidate.
I can believe this. Their two camps seem to be consistently the nicest across most demographics. Also the only two subs I can really stand being in for that reason. Biden camp isn't bad, just kinda boring and without energy. Sorry if anyone disagrees, just my limited perception.
Holy shit. Just clicked that link. They're actively campaigning to sabotage Democrats?!
The stance there is that policy and change is what matters, and removing trump but going to more of the same governing that ignored ordinary Americans before his presidency wouldn‚Äôt be a victory.   That‚Äôs why the VBNMH doesn‚Äôt really resonate there, because they have as many issues with the Dem presidencies as the GOP ones.  The other half of the argument is that if your biggest issue is removing trump vs policy, then getting on board with them keeps the absolute highest number of dem voters on the table for the general.
Being independent I get. My problem is these people obviously don‚Äôt care about Bernie‚Äôs policies, or they‚Äôd commit to voting for a dem to get the best they can (even if it‚Äôs less than Bernie). They just want a central figure to believe in who they feel is ‚Äúoutside the establishment.‚Äù And we literally have that as a President right now. The so-called establishment ain‚Äôt so evil compared to this.
But if they hate the DNC so much, why not just start their own thing?  Or is it that they're all about those DNC dollars
Why are you prioritizing beating Trump so much? I thought you liked Elizabeth Warren. If someone else wins, how will that satisfy your desires to have Elizabeth Warren be the President?
It would be a bad idea and highly unlikely for Sanders to pick Warren as a running mate, not to mention naming your VP to a cabinet post. I tend to think that story (which was leaked in the wake of the "a woman can't win" controversy) was leaked to protect Sanders, not to reaffirm a friendship.
I *am* a progressive socialist and they *still* call me a Republican.
Just call them dogmatic religious fundamentalists.

People have been arguing that Bernie has reached a ceiling since he was polling at 15%, and he's only gone up from there. Further, [a plurality of Biden voter's second choice is Sanders](https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/442738-poll-almost-one-third-of-biden-supporters-pick-sanders-as-their)
For the past few weeks Bernie has been steadily rising in polls and conversely for Warren.   Biden's second choice is Bernie by a 2 digit lead over Warren.  He is also gaining steam in Texas and also has the closest head to head against trump at the moment.  But feel free to ignore what I said if you don't care about polls.
what is the more important position, cabinet member or senate majority leader?
I've never had any doubt that Yang is a "do the right thing" kinda guy. He's good people. I'm sure he'll support whoever the nominee is.
This is a good point.   I think part of it is there's a circular-ness of the arguments. If people are unhappy with the status quo, it's good politics to campaign against the establishment, to campaign for 'change', to campaign against 'Washington insiders', etc. In the short-term, this gets votes and somewhat represents reality. But over time, if every campaign does it, people become more and more attracted to the candidates that are the most 'outside the system'. You get a system that can oscillate between Trump and Sanders. And it's only a matter of time the next candidate comes, calls Trump and Sanders "the establishment" and runs against them from the outside.   It's a cycle, and it's a lot harder to repair trust in the system than it is to "tear it down" and start over again. This is another reason I like Warren. She wants to make the system work. It's just a more difficult road.
>Regardless of the outcome of this election, the Democratic party really needs to reevaluate itself and how it can do more to appeal to those voters. Clearly they find something appealing about progressive policy but are unwilling to toe the party line.  Suggesting that it's policy they're attracted to is an assumption, and for a lot of them, I don't think it's a correct assumption.  I imagine a lot of these people were Ron Paul supporters in past elections. They aren't progressives, they're contrarians that'll latch on to any non-mainstream candidate, especially ones that push conspiracy theories and yell loudly about how all the "establishment" candidates are corrupt. They might give lip service to M4A or whatever other issue is at the forefront, but that won't make them vote for other candidates who support M4A, or stop them from supporting other fringe candidates who oppose M4A, like Ron Paul, in the future.   There's nothing a mainstream candidate can do to attract these voters because simply *being* a mainstream candidate has already turned them off.
Big mood
In my headcanon Elizabeth Warren would be a firm on her stance of Mutant's rights and she would have a plan to ban the use of sentinels against mutants.
Even though I've seen her on TV/social media the past few days, I feel like she *died* or something. Still sad.
 Elizabeth Warren 2024
Just watched her on SNL. This is how I feel now, and likely will a lot over the next... until she runs again.
I love that I have seen one of these for every candidate
We miss you Elizabeth! You would've been the best president! Always the intellectual giant in the room!
Same
I didn't know that she stayed until everyone at her events who wanted a selfie with her got one so I left when I saw how long the line already was thinking I wouldn't make it and now I'm super upset that I don't have one  üòû
[^sad face](https://youtu.be/Hn-enjcgV1o)
Is Warren actually Jean Gray?
Liz Warren had at least one mutant student when someone f'ed up and thought 'special education' was 'mutant education'. And you know Liz went to bat for that student.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dead, I‚Äôm just in the Senate.‚Äù
She's not dead she's like the Pheonix...but not X-Men Pheonix. More like Tezuka Pheonix.
She'll be back
...even bloomberg? are there actually people who miss bloomberg?
It kills me that so many people only just realized this solely because of SNL.
I miss Bloomberg     acting as Liz‚Äôs punching bag.
I know, right? I've loved her since 2008 and the CFPB.  I honestly thought then, "Man, we really need a president like this" but I never thought she'd run. Now I'm so sad to see her go. SNL was just the icing on the cake.
Apparently that was the missing ingredient. Of course.  ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Her lighting into Bloomberg and not letting up should be submitted for an Emmy award.
I will forever and always feel like a fraction of a person because we will never see a Warren vs. Trump debate.   My soul will heal, but will it ever be whole again?
Former Pete supporter here to join the Warren ranks
Hey friend! Sad to see him go, was an inspiration to see an LGBT candidate taken seriously. Hope there are many like you coming our way, looking for a unifying-but-progressive force! Thank you for your vote on Tuesday!
Same here. Pete supporter, but Warren was always a close second for me. She's the last candidate in this race that I would feel excited about winning the nomination. Wishing you guys well.
Also a former Pete supporter here. Buying Warren merch and donating as we speak!
Welcome to the Persistence!
Another Pete supporter backing Sen. Warren now. I was a campaign volunteer who spoke with thousands of individuals. Definitely met more Pete then Liz (and Liz then Pete) supporters than any other duo (though the lists I used had plenty of selection bias). Liz has my vote and my volunteer time. Thrilled to be here.  Edit: LFG!
The more you follow Warren the more you'll see that see is the obvious choice.... No bias of course.  Pete has a huge future. You'll be backing him again before too long.
Sorry about Pete dropping out. I think he ran a good, positive campaign, and I'm really excited about his future. And as a queer person myself, it was inspiring to see him succeed at such levels.
Welcome Aboard! We‚Äôre glad to have you and hope many more follow üòÅ
I really liked Pete and I loved his line about leadership being what you bring out of people. His defense of Biden when bidens family was being questioned on the debate stage was also absolutely admirable. I'm sad to see him go but I know he has a bright future ahead of him.  As for you, welcome to the team!
I can't vote cause I'm merely a politics junkie observing from the UK to avoid having to face my own country's utter nonsense right now but I was hoping primarily for Pete to win but now he's dropped out I'm going all-in for my 2nd favourite, so here I am to spread the love in my own uniquely useless way.
Another Pete refugee checking in. Thanks for making this post, feeling pretty bummed right now. We're all in this together!
Bring your friends, it's an open party and everyone's invited. Pete's a smart guy, he brought certain level headed sensibility to the discussion. Good to see him breaking barriers too. He's got a bright future.
Another Pete-to-Warren Super Tuesday voter checking in. I was proud to vote for Warren during her first Senate run when I lived in Boston, and she would have been my first choice if I hadn't fallen for Pete's demeanor and message of hope. Warren has long been my close second choice - I even donated a bit early on - so please please please let her hang in there to see what happens on Tuesday!
Welcome!
Thanks for coming aboard! I‚Äôm really sorry his candidacy didn‚Äôt pan out. Despite ideological differences, I always thought he was a great debater, and as a gay man, it was uplifting to see him succeed.
Sorry about Pete. He wasn‚Äôt my chosen candidate, but I spent a lot of time seriously considering him and see why so many people loved him. We are happy to welcome you to a new home!
I‚Äôve always been a large critic of Pete, it‚Äôs true. I personally disliked some of his policies. But similar to Biden, I view Pete with the utmost respect.He did something truly impressive and his supporters were instrumental in that. I never thought in a million years Mayor Pete would outlast Senator Harris and Senator Gillibrand.  As a fellow gay man, I think he will be important in encouraging future LGBT candidates to take a shot at the presidency.   I really hope he gets a position in Warren‚Äôs cabinet or does well in Indiana statewide.
LFG! I gave a dollar to Pete when he declared for the representation but always favored Warren. Welcome! Warren can beat Bernie and Biden.
Glad to have you! Welcome aboard.
Thank you, Buttigege was my 2nd place choice despite all the hate on Reddit.
Sincerely sorry your candidate didn't make it, that's gotta be rough. But welcome! Come on in, let's get this thing done together!
I was an early Pete supporter, from before his campaign really made waves.  Specifically his interview on Pod Save America really made me consider him.  His anti-corruption stance is what impressed me the most, and that's my most important issue.  M4A, while important, isn't going to happen until we change the system and dig out corruption, and Warren's message on that brought me to her camp, but I never forgot about that side of Pete even though I didn't hear much about it lately from his campaign.  And in a choice between Pete and Bernie, I've been leaning to Pete, but now Warren is our only chance at sweeping anti-corruption policies.
Welcome! Husband is a Pete supporter that I convinced to vote for Warren (this Tuesday) only by running as a pledged delegate for her (and therefore upping the ante- he wants to vote for his wife lol!). I‚Äôve been so impressed every time I heard him speak and honestly his Medicare for all who want it argument really got to me.
üñ§
Take time to grieve if you need it! I know I would. But we are happy to have you here!
Hey welcome! I hope you‚Äôll find in the Warren campaign some of the best things about the Pete campaign:  - Smart ideas - progressive but still valuing all parts of the party  It‚Äôs heartbreaking when your candidate drops out, really feel for you right now!
As a former Pete supporter as well (literally have a BOOT EDGE EDGE shirt), welcome to our ranks! LFG!
Happy to have you! Welcome to the team - together we are stronger!
Welcome! I'm sorry about Pete. I guess this wasn't his time, but we are all better for having gotten to know him. I know we haven't seen the last of him! We really have an awesome field.
Know it sucks to lose your candidate, my condolences.  But glad to have you here!  Welcome Aboardl!
I‚Äôm also here from Team Pete and all I gotta say is, what do we gotta do?  I can‚Äôt vote for Biden or Bernie.  Warren needs to win this nomination.  Tell me, WHAT DO WE GOTTA DO!?  That‚Äôs the work ethic we‚Äôre bringing into this.
Welcome aboard! This process has been beyond cruel to you all.
Man its really sad he dropped out. I can see logisticaly why he made that decision but it really sucks. He was my first number 1 this year(then i went to warren after), he has so much going for him and hes only 38! I cant wait to see what else he does in the next few years. Glad to have you here in our camp!
Please welcome aboard! Warren is my #1 and Pete was my #2. Sad that he dropped out but oh well.
Also team Pete here. Unfortunately I can't vote for Warren on Tuesday because I already mailed my ballot.
Welcome! And I hope you don't get too bummed, Pete's so young and clearly talented. He's got a long future ahead of him. Edit: that being said, after thinking a sec, I know having an out gay man running was so meaningful for people, so actually, feel however you need to feel. But welcome either way.
Ex Colorado Republican here. I  came here to see if Warren was getting an influx from Pete supporters. I've been rooting for Warren for a while now and I'm really hoping she can capitalize big on this. I'd have a much easier time pulling the lever for her in the general than Biden or Bernie.
Welcome - plenty of room. Pete‚Äôs candidacy was both historic and deft. Looking forward to seeing what he contributes in his undoubtedly long future.
I cannot wait to see where Pete goes from here. He was one of the smartest two people on every debate stage and I absolutely loved his idea of the 15 person supreme court. Hopefully some of his ideas make it through to our Democratic Platform this fall! This might not be the contest for him to win, but I have no doubt in my mind that he will be able to do well in other future endeavors. Welcome, friend! :)
Thanks so much!  And welcome.  And I'm sorry for what you must be feeling; as Warren supporters we know what it's like to not do as well as we think our candidate deserves.
Welcome! Donated to both at some point in this race.
Welcome! I think Buttigieg has a lot of potential, and it sucks to believe in someone and have no one else get it. Hope you can be inspired by Warren this year, and I'm sure we'll hear from Pete again down the line.
Welcome! Pete ran an incredibly impressive campaign and there is no doubt we'll be seeing him again.
Sorry your preferred candidate didn't make it! Welcome aboard.
Sorry about Pete! I think he is a good enough guy, even though I didn‚Äôt agree with all of his stances. As a queer person, it was AWESOME to see an openly gay candidate get so much support.   I truly feel like you won‚Äôt be disappointed with Warren, and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here.
Welcome aboard. I think Pete would make a great VP and run again in 2028. Bring your friends and we'll make the White House smart again!
Welcome! #LFG
Welcome man. I came from Beto and Yang camps. So I know how you feel.
Great news! I was just thinking that Sanders supporters might be wishing they had behaved better about now. Who to join? The group who called me a fascist for supporting a democratic candidate or the very reasonable and inclusive Warren campaign?
Welcome aboard!
I'm sorry to see Pete drop out. I think he has a bright future ahead of him! And welcome to the team. We're happy to have you üíô
Thanks for your support! Welcome to the fight!
My heart! I‚Äôm watching his concession speech. He is a great guy.
FWIW, after reading Vox's The Case For Pete, he was my second choice.
We are happy to have you , and happen to have any kind of policy discussions you want or have!
So glad you‚Äôre on board! (Sorry about your candidate, although he clearly has a bright political future in some capacity.)  Liz is great and we can do this!
Welcome aboard. I'm in Iowa and was incredibly impressed with the campaign organizations of Pete and Elizabeth both and that is who my choice was between. It was a bit of a coin flip, but ended up going with Warren. I'm really sorry this happened so suddenly.
Thank you so much!
Welcome! I watched his concession speech feeling sad that he was dropping out but also with immense admiration and respect. I would love to adopt the Rules of the Road or something similar.
Ya Warren was my second choice too but I already early voted not knowing he was going to do this ü•∫
Honestly I am a little bummed about Pete too. He has considerably more delegates than Warren and recent debate performances warmed me up to him over Bernie or Biden. I still think he was too inexperienced for the presidency but I would like to see him run for Senate in the next midterms, now that he has a much stronger brand and a fundraising network to overcome blood-red Indiana.
Bienvenidos!
Welcome aboard to anyone from Pete‚Äôs camp! Sorry about your guy, I didn‚Äôt love his positions on everything but he was a lot of fun to watch in the debates. I‚Äôll miss him up there. If we could have had a Liz & Pete primary with everyone else dropping out, I‚Äôd have been pretty damned happy.
I'd be happy with a Warren/Buttigieg ticket.
OMG do Bernie bros always brigade this sub this much? And I thought Pete's sub was bad with that...
Sorry your guy tapped out.  It's great to have you with us.
Welcome aboard! Pete was my solid second favorite (I wish we had ranked choice voting, and liked his ideas about the supreme court.
The road to the 2020 election has already been long. It was hard for me (as a Warren supporter) to watch Pete‚Äôs speech tonight with dry eyes. I look forward to watching his political career evolve.  I know that the Buttigieg supporters have a heavy heart tonight. Maybe you can find solace knowing that we appreciate your passion & support for Team Warren.  Thank you for setting a strong example for other campaigns & their supporters. ‚úåüèº
Welcome aboard mate. We're still holding strong. No purity test here. Just friendly supporters.
Welcome!  Also, may I ask why you were bummed about Buttigieg?  EDIT: I just woke up and haven't checked [the news](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/1/21121523/pete-buttigieg-drops-out-2020-presidential-election), everything changed so quickly huh.
Welcome aboard!
Me too! Excited to be here
Welcome!!! Pete was inspiring in so many ways. I'm certain that we will definitely be seeing much more of him on the national stage!
Welcome!  Let us know if you have any questions etc:):)
Welcome! Mayor Pete has a promising career ahead of him and imo Warren is a better candidate for having run against him. Here's hoping for a strong showing tomorrow :)
Oh no
Thank you and welcome!
What attracted you to Pete?  What attracts you to Warren?  How do you feel about each: Bernie, Biden, and Bloomberg?

Pete has always been my number two.  He has been such a pragmatic and intelligent voice in the campaign.  I am so sad that he has dropped out.
Welcome! I'm so glad you're with us!
Welcome!!
Yay! Condolences and welcome!!
Welcome!!! Lots of nice people in this sub if you ever have any questions.
Welcome!
My favorite is the Billionaire Tears mug, I wish I had the $25 to get one.
Damn there's more Pete supporters in here than Warren.
Awesome, glad to hear it!
Welcome!!
She has some great merch!
You are a gentleperson and scholar
Oh I like this!
Welcome aboard, friendo! I hope Pete and Chasten‚Äôs dogs get to meet Bailey Warren. They‚Äôre all good democratic pups.
Welcome!  You'll be cheering Pete on again; he has a bright future.
Welcome! You are very welcome here.
That volunteer time means so much; it's a real show of support.  I wanted to highlight to everyone just how admirable it is to dig deep in a time of difficulty and keep pushing forward.  Hope I see you out on the doors one day!
LFG!
So happy to have you!
"Trump can say what he wants about me, but it's outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors. The public must see the transcript of Trump's call with Xi. And we need a leader who will stand up for our values."
China, if you are listening, please publish the transcript of your phone call with Trump. You will be heavily rewarded..by our press.
The statement was perfect. It was a perfect conversation.
Even bart simpson would be a better president than he is
I know we haven't seen a lot of it lately,  but this is quality civic leadership y'all. She's not going to let this shit get under her skin but she isn't just going to take this shit lying down. She's focused on the goal - good governance - rather than herself. In one tweet she's demonstrated that she has a much more constructive approach to both domestic and foreign politics than Trump.
Saying Trump isn't hard enough on China is kinda ridiculous though
Wait, are you asking a foreign country to assist the campaign of a candidate? That's illegal.
A bowl of dry dog turds would be a better president
This is literally about him not standing up for Democracy in Hong Kong so China will help him out.  Our preeminent values are supposed to be support for self-determination in the face of authoritarianism, not raging against trade deficits.
Do you think Trumps trade strategy is an efficient and likely to cause desirable outcomes? Do you think his strategy is the best available strategy?
Is it possible to give negative gold?
Trump is very weak on China, probably the weakest since Nixon. That's why.our trade deficit with them is now at record highs.
Hang on. I‚Äôll just call you and explain everything.
/s?
The other guy is quoting The Dotard when he asked Russia to find Hillary's emails in 2016
As someone not running I say yes. It would do a lot for my perception of a country were you release a transcript of our president trying to extort them. In reality they cannot. Trump can tell xi whatever the fuck and they have to weigh the immediate consequences to their country for not cooperating.   While I understand the sentiment in how this could be seen as slightly borderline we literally have something not borderline at all. Our president is openly extorting multiple countries for his own gain. I don't give two shits about Biden, and really if warren is also a criminal lock her up too. I don't give any shits about who on what side, I'm tired of our government being criminal. Lock all the fucks up we can prove anything about.  To he ultra clear trump committed this crime and doubled down on it, but if we are in whataboutisms prosecute all of them.  To be double ultra clear that means our DoJ and FBI investigating.
All his trade strategies are doing is increasing cost to American consumers.
No, but that doesn't mean he isn't hard on China.
Sounds like you don't understand sarcasm.
"Lock him up!"  This is as irrational as the Trumpists. Sigh.
And permanently costing US exporters a strategic partner.
Why so binary? Is the entire relationship between the two largest economies so easily boiled down to "Hard"  or "Not Hard"?  Is there no room for additional nuance across  a nation of 325 Million and 1.2 Billion people?   Trumps Trade war is an inefficient mess that is likely going to end in him offering concessions to China because he is trying to avoid a domestic recession that will hurt his reelection campaign despite the fact that we have already paid an enormous costs in fighting China.  All this while we have had long term problems with our trade relation with China that was going to be addressed by the signing of TPP and initiation of a multilateral attempt to bring China into compliance with what the Western world wanted.  We had a solution that was being built over years, but because it got politicized in the 2016 race, all of the presidential nominees said they would scrap it. Then Trump DID scrap it. Years worth of work, thrown on the floor and replaced by a tariff regime that hurts our domestic people WAY more than it needed to.  But even then. Trump offers silence for Hong Kong for NO benefit to the United States people. It is horrible enough that we put a price on their heads, it is even worse that the price was so pathetically small.
No it's not. If any leader violated the law follow due course.   Don't break the law attacking a political opponent (I don't think Warren did that).  It's pretty simple to expect our representatives to follow the law.  To be clear I'm pro warren and think the Biden thing is bs, but fuck this partisan shit. Get criminals out of office. No one is arguing investigating Biden is absurd, the legal argument is that this way of doing it is illegal.  To again be super clear we investigated Trump, Clinton, Bill Clinton, probably Obama. That's fine. It's our duty to an extent. Asking China and Ukraine to is not acceptable, and in an election period, illegal.
So I found a Bloomberg billboard generator ...

She could roast him beyond cooked, and still lose to him! I am frightened for America if the orange red one takes 4 more years.
I dont understand this
This is perfect
I feel like this is more of a positive for Warren... like she owned Bloomberg, so by this logic she'll own Trump. Great!!!!
I love the blue and red 2020 on the bloomberg ads  it's the coming police state
I'm a bit confused as to why warren has gone so hard after Bloomberg.   Don't get me wrong, I understand if people don't like bloomberg. That's not my issue, here.   The thing is, there's likely to be very little overlap between Liz and Mike voters, so her attacks on him are unlikely to draw in any more support for Liz.   Meanwhile there is lots of overlap between Liz and Bernie voters, but she seems to have saved most of her ire for Bloomberg.  I'm hoping at this debate she turns some of that ire on Bernie.
My meager contribution, inspired by the SC debate...   Bloomberg's new healthcare billboard:    https://imgur.com/a/ipSRQLU

To be fair, Hillary already did that to Trump and it didn‚Äôt change anything.
Does Mike‚Äôs team get this doesn‚Äôt help their campaign in the slightest? It actually hurts them. Makes them look sexist.
I love this one, deserves a separate post!

Shoulda put trump in quotes cause is he really a billionaire? Or is he lying about his net worth like everything else.
She eviscerated bloomberg in the debate, and would do the same to trump

At my last job, we discovered a bug that if you hit enter on a request too many times, the prod server and its backup would crash. We found this out because salesmen would hit enter on said button and the request would occasionally take awhile. So they keep pressing enter. Server gets overloaded with a gazillion requests and ultimately dies. A patch was quickly and quietly applied but that was a fun bug to track down.

Ohhhh lol
lol I‚Äôm sure his campaign thought making these signs go viral was such a clever idea.
Nick Offerman voted Warren today!
I love how much of the Parks and Rec crew love warren. Ron Swanson would love Warren‚Äôs anti-corruption plans.
Despite his persona on Parks and Rec, Offerman is a true feminist and sex-positive person in real life.  He and his wife have a podcast where they invite friends to talk about stuff in their bed.
Good stuff Nick! Those replies though... Urgh.

[Hey Ron! You're not going to vote for Warren, are you?](https://imgur.com/a/KfdSv5E)
Wondering how Reddit is taking that news since it loves Ron Swanson and yet hates anyone not Bernie.
I didn't think it was possible for me to adore Nick Offerman more, but apparently it is!
Unity candidate! I love this, we need more men to blast their support for Warren!
Hell yeah!
Hope he is celebrating with bourbon and steak.
Hell yeah!
!WarrenPlanBot status check
who cares
She was also against how the bailouts happened
A lot of government workers have to deal with policy on a daily basis. No surprise they would support the strongest policy candidate.
Who else from the cast has supported Warren? This makes me happy to hear.
Ron dislikes government, but scorns dishonest, unreliable and otherwise shady people.  He is an ethical capitalist.  I have to believe he‚Äôd grudgingly support Liz, as his respect for her outweighs any ideological differences, and she is Leslie Knope personified.
And even in P&R, he's still pretty much a feminist, minus two sociopaths named Tammy.
Him and Megan are major couple goals
Don't read the replies. NEVER read the replies.
You don't attack Ron Swanson on Twitter.  You just don't.
Possibly my favorite moment in all of television
>rich celebrity has a political opinion  I mean, it's not exactly newsworthy
Ben Wyatt!
Don't forget that Ron Swanson was Woman of the Year!
Tammy 2 is played by his wife.
He might have a hand-made coffin in your size already.
Michael Schur has also been a very vocal supporter on twitter!
Of course he'd vote for the real life Leslie Knope!
I've always loved that.
MOSE!
Look who‚Äôs on the cover of Rolling Stone...
I'm sure Trump has photoshopped himself into TONS of Rolling Stone Magazine covers üòÇ
What a rock star!
Hope she gets a bump of attention from Obama's warmth, this, and Castro's endorsement. I am honestly perplexed by the lack of energy she has here on Reddit. I say this as a former 2016 Sanders supporter... I thought more would be in my boat.
Awesome, I haven't bought a magazine in years. Guess that ends.
Great sweater!!
Love her!!!
The interview within was great too! Felt even more confident in her after reading it!
Fuck yeah, Liz rocks!
Rolling Stone!  (Liz got her face on the cover)  Rolling Stone!  (Gonna send five copies to my mother)  [Note: not really; my relationship with my family is strained as it is]
My girl! I love how bold and forthright she is!
Liz should totally get some purple in her hair lol  Edit: Speaking of female politician‚Äôs hair color, anyone know why Gabbard only has a single grey streak? Is it a birthmark that‚Äôs always been like that?
The media cycle for a candidate sucks: Praise, surge, declare frontrunner, attack, pronounce over, find new candidate to repeat the same cycle. It's Bernie's turn right now.
Love this more than LIFE!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Where's her power-blazer?
[removed]
I love Warren as much as the next guy but rolling stone lost its reputation forever when they put dzokar tsarnaev or however the fuck you spell it on their cover.
Maybe if her candidacy paid millions of dollars for Reddit influencing like both of the 16 campaigns did. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Personally, I think a lot on here don't speak up as much knowing there seems to be Bernie stans in every thread ready to be decisive and downvote everyone to give an appearance that anyone that's not Bernie isn't popular.
There's a *lot* of hate out there trying to scare 2016 Sanders supporters away from her so that they will either stick with Sanders or simply divide the Democratic party entirely.  Nobody wants to remember the hundreds of articles about the fact that Sanders was filling a gap that should've been filled by Warren in 2016, but she decided not to run.  In 2013 we were hearing Sanders (when he said he didn't want to run in 2016) say:  > [‚ÄúElizabeth is one of the smartest people here in the Senate,‚Äù he said, noting he has not talked to Warren about a run for president. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very fond of Elizabeth, she is a real progressive.‚Äù ](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/bernie-sanders-2016-election-100020) In 2019 we're hearing all the divisive media and reddit community saying:  > [No, Warren and Sanders Are Not the Same](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/10/18/no-warren-and-sanders-are-not-same)  Lies are a bloody shame.
> I am honestly perplexed by the lack of energy she has here on Reddit.    It‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a woman
Right there with you.
I'm in your boat and I'm ready to keep fighting! :) I'm planning on making calls and have been talking her up every chance I get. I've been studying her plans so I can better communicate about them. That the type of energy you're hoping for? We got this.
I'm was/am a big Bernie fan and voted for him in 2016.  Still leaning toward Warren this year.  Honestly if either get it I'll be very happy.

I completely forgot about that. Fucking disgusting.
Well spoken fapsandnaps. I send peer-to-peer texts for Liz and there‚Äôs SO MUCH positive progressive energy all across the country.  Bernie supporters are way less aggro IRL. Definitely way more supportive of Warren than the reddit Bernie stans would have you believe.  I‚Äôve never been shy to say Bernie is my 2nd choice and most folks I chat with where he‚Äôs their 1st don‚Äôt mind in the slightest that Liz is my top pick. Most even name her as their 2nd choice because electing a progressive in Warren or Bernie is way better than a moderate like Biden or Pete.   End of the day it‚Äôs a blue no matter who year. Let‚Äôs all fight like hell for our candidate and once a democratic nominee has been made that‚Äôs who gets the vote in November. We can be divided in the primary, but we have to be united in the general.
really? link to influencing figures?
I don't agree. Tulsi Gabbard generated a ridiculously disproportionate amount of buzz because she and the Russians had an effective social media strategy. Hillary Clinton also had tons of support and energy on Reddit. Criticizing her even now still earns you downvotes on /r/politics. I'm well aware that plenty of people on reddit also hate her, but you can say the same thing about other politicians. Sanders alternates between being shat on and ridiculous praise on that sub.  I'd also argue that Warren had plenty of support and energy on Reddit earlier this year, and the decline in energy has more to do with the her campaign bleeding support to Sanders more than anything else.  I'm not saying sexism isn't a real and significant problem for women running for office, especially on places like Reddit. However we shouldn't use it a vague excuse for everything the campaign struggles with.  Warren needs to invest in a botting campaign. It's that simple. Her competitors are all doing it because it works. That's the world we live in now.
Removed for trolling.
Not exactly; her hair has started going grey and she dyes the rest of it, leaving the streak in remembrance of fallen service members.   [Source](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/04/politics/tulsi-gabbard-gray-hair-streak-iraq-trnd/index.html).
Do yourself a favor and read the accompanying article.  There‚Äôs a lot of nuance missed by the reactionary way this was covered in the wider media
Well spoken. A lot of us Sanders supporters feel exactely that way and root for Warren as well. She is by far the second choice of Bernie¬¥s supporter base. Great cover btw
> Bernie supporters are way less aggro IRL  Absolutely.  I've never met a Bernie support face-to-face who was an ass to me.  It's a lot easier to create hate online.

#PresidentElizabethWarren Trends After She Announces Intentions To Investigate Crimes Against Immigrants If Elected To White House
This is one of the major techniques we're going to use to defeat the GOP going forward.  No more of this "the country needs to move forward" bullshit.    Crimes were committed.  We're a nation of laws.  These people deserve due process of laws and if found guilty they need to be in prison.  Also, we should give them the respect they deserve as humans beings.  No concentration camps.   Fair trial, preferably no bail, fail jail and prison conditions.  Justice.
Hold anyone in both houses of Congress accountable for their votes.  That would be a radical move in the right direction.
Warren is the only candidate that has justice on the agenda. I want justice.
I'm going to be honest, I think a lot of what is driving her support above all, is how she boldly comes out against Trump every time, with a strength the other candidates can't/don't quite match. Of course, her plans and policies are getting a lot of attention too now, which is great-but I think this is one of the things about her that catches the eyes of voters who otherwise didn't pay attention. I'll admit it was part of what got me interested in her candidacy.
Crimes Against Human Rights. Multiple violations of Human Rights.  Now the base is truly fired up. Even though it genuinely came from her heart, still a great idea.  They also need to investigate the missing babies. I don't think they are actually missing but were adopted out.
She's in office now so why not start now?    Don't understand all the people talking about helping people in camps 2 years from now. Need action now!
Why not *all* crimes?
Stop equating immigrants with illegal aliens. Stop pushing the plantation mentality to the uninformed.   Disgraceful.
That's not enough.  People need to go to jail.  (ah hem... mcconnell)
Bernie too :0
It's one of the reasons she's looking more electable now right behind Biden. As Biden continues to be weak on Trump, she's going to eventually look the most electable if she wins Iowa and New Hampshire.  His reaction to Trump about impeachment, and the length of time it took for him to get there, made him look weak.
Because she‚Äôs in the legislative branch not the executive branch. This is what I was saying in the other thread ppl were saying that they need her in senate because she‚Äôs so good with policies. Precisely why we need her be the head o executive branch as POUS.
As president she can sign an EO to knock off all this bullshit and has the clout over executive bodies.  As a legislator she has a ton of red tape to go through and will likely get blocked anyways
She‚Äôs not really in a position to do that. It‚Äôs out of scope of her current job.
I mean she could try but it‚Äôs not like McConnell is going to let anything come of it so it‚Äôs kinda a waste of time. Her time is better spent developing a plan of action of things she can do once she is president.
Republicans would shut her down at every turn I assume.
Focus.  &#x200B;  "investigate all crimes" is not a meaningful plan.
FBI...Does a pretty good job already
Doesn‚Äôt fit the agenda.
Because she's pandering. Just like every other politician.
Seeking asylum is not illegal.
Speaking of uninformed
An illegal immigrant is still an immigrant. And just because someone does something illegal (unlike applying for asylum), the punishment should still fit the crime.       Living in a place that you do not have the legal right to be in is not so severe of a crime that it justifies being taken from your family and put into a concentration camp.
Holding them accountable isn‚Äôt ruling out jail.  It‚Äôs a pretty open ended thing to say.
It's crazy how far apart they are philosophically and how close they are with their conclusions for policy.  There was an article posted to the sub about how people liked her because she's so different than Bernie and how other people like her because she is so similar to Bernie.   I think people see in a candidate what appeals most to them. I would like a detailed debate on that instead of the shit show we've had to sit through.   Too many candidates qualified for the next debate. Hopefully, PBS will do a better job.
Not to mention the Republican majority, especially under Cocaine Mitch's leadership, will stifle every effort made to investigate those human rights abuses. I shouldn't let Schumer and Durbin off the hook for failing to rally Senate Democrats against the insufficient border funding bill though.
That's not a reason not to fight. You don't win playing defense.
Only if the DOJ let's them do their job.  *Stares at Barr*
I had so very much wanted her to be better.
Asylum seekers are called refugees, not immigrants.   Also economic migrants aren't immigrants.  Stop trying to farm "immigrant" votes and raising a generation of American born "immigrant children" using thr US tax payer's money.  You think it's free money but that is money the US goverment is borrowing that will be paid off by your children, grandchildren.   So Kumbaya since it's not your money you're spending.
That person has such a relevant user name... just wish they'd turn that energy towards some introspection.
We have a time traveler from the WWII!  If you keep telling the lie long and big enough, people will believe it.  It is one matter to be deported after being caught. It is another to walk into these "concentration camps".  Don't let the door hit you on the ass on your way out. You can't sue an door for sexual harrassment.  Or can you? According to you way of thinking, you can.  "Illegal immigrants and concentration camps"    Don't think too hard and just submit your vote like the sheep you are. That's all your worth to the party.  Never get involved in local politics. Save the community from your victim mentality.  The party needs to be fixed from within.  We just need your votes.
Also I‚Äôm pretty comfortable with her seat being replaced by another dem in MA. It‚Äôs not the same as somebody like Beto who I would much rather see run for the other Texas senate seat because he almost took down Ted Cruz who is a much bigger name than the guy I would have to google after making this comment. Warren(Bernie as well) I am thoroughly confident with being replaced by another dem in the senate whereas most of the other people running are far more useful as senators.
She also knows how to use executive powers including orders and regulatory tools. She's one of the only candidates talking about tools beyond executive orders.  She can't do that as a Senator.
And she‚Äôs fighting by running for President so she can be in a position to effect real change.
She's already fighting.
you also don't throw into triple coverage on first and 10.
So should we not investigate crimes of physical and sexual abuse against migrants?
Well I mean it's the default play for everyone. I don't know when both sides will learn that pandering gets you nowhere. Trump keep saying stupid shit about getting coal mining back and the democrats all want to help foreigners over Americans. It's just political pandering.  edit: fixed spelling.
Trump and his supporters just so happen to hate refugees too. Weird.
So the governor of Massachusetts is a Republican... are we sure the laws mandate a special election for that seat? I know there was one after Ted Kennedy's death; I just want to be sure the same law applies, because otherwise Charlie Baker would appoint a Republican to succeed Warren, at least for the short term.
> the democrats all want to help foreigners over Americans  real nuanced take here
Wow. Nice attempt lumping me with Trump.   This is why there is no political discourse anymore.  I'm a registered democrat from NYC.  I will call out shitty policies regardless of affiliation.  There is nothing wrong with enforcing the US border.   I called it as it is, the article and political discussion from the party keep throwing out the word immigrants like a magic get out of jail free card.  The only crimes against immigrants is the broken immigration system that is currently in place.  My parents are legal immigrants and are proud citizens now.  Overstaying an visa and crossing a border doesn't make you an immigrant.  Edit:ready for the personal attacks about my family and I for having "wrongthink".
I have no clue honestly but will look into it. Are there other places where the governor can just appoint an elected position like a senator or two? I understand they can appoint unelected things like judges but I haven‚Äôt heard about them appointing an elected position like a senator
I know Scott Brown won the seat in a special election and I've only been able to find articles speculating on who would replace her so I feel pretty safe in saying there'd be a special election. I don't know when she'd have to resign her seat, but I'd imagine there'd be some time between election and inauguration so even if the governor did select a temp they wouldn't be there long.
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-winning-the-white-house-could-cost-democrats-the-senate-at-least-temporarily/  If Warren left the Senate for the White House, MA's Republican governor would appoint a presumably Republican replacement until a special election in 5 months. Warren can move this up a few months by resigning immediately after the election.
It's true. They mostly talk about helping migrants move here. Hell Beto was campaigning in Mexico. The democrats pander to immigrants because they think they will get the Latino vote if they do.  They're don't actually give a shit about immigrants.
>The only crimes against immigrants is the broken immigration system that is currently in place.  How about ripping the children out of the arms of their mothers refugees and immigrants. Trump makes no such distinction.  >Overstaying an visa and crossing a border doesn't make you an immigrant.  It most certainly does. What makes you an immigrant is the fact you decided to live in this country...legal status aside.
Governor appoints a senator until a special election is held, which must take place in I believe 90 to 150 days. Dems in that state should look to change the rule now, to make sure the successor has to be a Democrat and not a Republican.
Brown ran against Martha Coakley who was shit at campaigning. If Kennedy gets her spot, that would be different.  Obama talking about Martha:  >Well, the first thing that‚Äôs happening is I‚Äôm talking to Rahm [Emanuel, then chief of staff], and Jim Messina [then deputy chief of staff] and saying, ‚ÄòOkay, explain to me how this happened,‚Äô‚Äù Obama told the magazine. ‚ÄúIt was at that point that I learned that our candidate, Martha Coakley, had asked, rhetorically, ‚ÄòWhat should I do, stand in front of Fenway and shake hands with voters?,‚Äô and we figured that wasn‚Äôt a good bellwether of how things might go.  Source: https://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/10/03/obama-martha-coakley-scott-brown-new-york-magazine/  Coakley is also the one that's responsible for the overreaction to the *Aqua Teen Hunger Force* publicity stunt.   Source: https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/01/31/boston-mooninite-panic-2007/  She was an absolute dumbass. Democrats actually paid attention to the next race and put forth the best candidate for the job: Elizabeth Warren.
I know, it's crazy!  They think that if they include people who live here and work here and contribute to society and their communities that they deserve to be treated like human beings. Crazy!  Why would Democrats actually want a comprehensive plan to allow people to live as they currently do, but have the law reflect their lives and contributions. I mean - I know businesses want to continue to exploit these people (they have no recourse for their exploitation because they are caught in an antiquated system) while telling white Americans to hate them so workers as a whole are too divided to fight for a living wage or benefits of any kind. But why would Democrats want to update immigration laws?? So crazy!!  It must be because they want the Latino vote. I mean, Tucker Carlson says they're making this country "dirtier" and Trump agrees, but...I'm sure Latinos vote for Democrats because they've been fooled, right??  It's much better the way Republicans have planned immigration reform...um...a wall...and...well I'll let you tell me what the Republican plan is for immigration reform. Surely they have one and haven't simply painted themselves into a corner by demonizing immigrants and refugees as a whole so if they ever even suggest immigration reform for a moment then their base (the only thing they have left) will call it "amnesty".  But I mean...both sides, mirite??
That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.  Don't take your citizenship for granted. Take your own advice and "immigrate" to Canada. They will deport you faster than the ICE.  Also the policy of child separation is a debatable policy.  Children had been afforded certain leeway in terms of getting an extended review for asylum and for goverment benefits. There was a huge uptick in illegal border crossings and human trafficking of children after parents learned that children had a chance to work the system.  This happened during the Obama administration when the courts ruled that even children with no legal status can attend public school and receive goverment benifiets.   With the DREAM program that Obama initiated, children became mules and choice targets for fake familes and traffickers.  A trafficker would take a bunch of kids and try to cross the border. Many of them died during the trek through the deserts and river crossings.  It had gotten to the point where the Obama admin had to plead families not to send their children because they WILL be sent back and the risk of death is too high.  This had been reported upon in the past.  Also stop using the word immigrant. You sound like a russian bot spewing propaganda and inflammatory rhetoric.  I dislike the seperation policy as well but it is a necessary step in the vetting process.  You keep spouting "immigrant" as if the definition would suddenly change.  The age of settlers is over. You cannot simply sail across the sea and lay claim to any land you see or arrive at.  Also the word concentration camp is a disgracful smear  to the Holocaust Survivors.  These "concentration camps" had been operating well within the Obama Admin and held more "immigrants" who had been caught seeking "asylum".  There is a problem when a fvuking caravan of hundreds of economic migrants make it through 2-3+ countries in Latin America to seek asylum.

Is.... is Mike Bloomberg proving that Elizabeth Warren can get billionaires to capitulate based only on her ability to publicly shame them? Because that‚Äôs exactly what I want a president to be able to do
I am happy to see billionaires be public shamed
What am I missing? What did he capitulate?
Yes.
I‚Äôve met a Bloomberg supporter in real life.  Nice guy, not too bright.  Tells me he took an online poll in which he answered questions about his values and which policies he liked and it turned out that the candidate with whom he mostly closely identifies is Bloomberg!    I laughed out loud when he told me.  I think my response was appropriately cynical without insulting him.  I just said, who issued the poll? Bloomberg gang?   This Bloomberg guy is dangerous.  I don‚Äôt think most people know much about him and just see a few ads where he says, I heart America, and think, yeah! Me too!
yes   yes   yes     yes    yes
She didn't publicly shame him really. He is publicly shaming himself. Everything that brought him down a peg was his own behavior and history. Warren just brought it out and refused to let him change the subject or settle for a lame apology.
I don't mean to be a buzzkill, but Bloomberg was pinned.  This was damage control to keep him relevant his 400+ million investment into his presidential run.  When Warren is president, she will be dealing with the GOP, who have no shame.  Which is when handcuffs will be needed.  For them.  For Wells Fargo.  For Facebook....
That's exactly what voters don't want though..
Personally I'd like my president to be able to act like an adult and use proper behavior to get things done. Not act like a high schooler starring in their first play.
No lol. Bloomberg is trying to run for office. Find me other billionaires that have ‚Äúcapitulated‚Äù due to shame that are not involved in wanting a public office.   What is this spam?
The problem is it only works on Democrats. Sure, it helps get them from being the Dem candidate, but if she tries it on Trump, he doesn‚Äôt have to feel shame because that feeling is not a part of being a Republican.
[removed]
Sure, but it just makes us feel good without accomplishing anything.  Do you think the Koch brothers care about being publicly shamed?  Or Larry Ellison?
Bloomberg LOVES being shamed. It means he‚Äôs in the headlines. He‚Äôs running a campaign to destroy the legitimacy of the Democratic Primary. And he‚Äôs succeeding. Think Trump was a bad reality tv star? Bloomberg‚Äôs bringing that cheese to the DNC real quick.
He is going to release 3 cherry picked NDA's
Me too, my Father actually wrote him in, in New Hampshire ...  According to my Father he wants someone who can fight Trump dirty, regardless of what that will do to our public discourse.  The odd bit is, he's a long-time Biden supporter, who actually voted for Sanders in the 2016 Primary ...  But, he's also a former New Yorker, and as soon as Biden flamed out, he started talking about Bloomberg.
Right. Shame isn't something you do to other people, it's something you feel yourself. If you simply don't have that muscle, then it doesn't matter how shameful your actions are, nor how forcefully people bring those actions to light.  If you're waiting for Trump or billionaires to suddenly start feeling shame, you're missing the point.
That is because Trump is a dumpster. The problem for Republicans is only Republican voters still support Trump, and without independent voters, they are gonna come up short come election day.
Removed: I know your joking, but it is still not allowed.
Why do you think they don't have debates with people outside of their wealth class in public. They don't want to be humiliated like Bloomberg just was.
I don't think he has destroyed the legitimacy of the Democratic Primary, if anything he is hurting moderate Democrats, whether he knows it or not.
I do think there‚Äôs a point in there somewhere about giving a bad candidate free unearned media, but the legitimacy of the Democratic Party and Bloomberg as a reality TV star are a little much.
The Bloomberg sub (yes, it exists. Roughly 1.5k strong) is all over that. ‚ÄúWow only 3 in 30 years? Sounds like a nonissue to me‚Äù   As if three were every single one lol.
I don't know if it's fair to say "cherry-picked" (it might well be, we just don't know). But it's only three. And I think it's clear that the entirety of Bloomberg's money canon will fire on any of the three women who decide to speak out.
Imagine having so many NDAs you could pick and choose between them for ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones
Dude is so out of touch that he doesn‚Äôt realize only releasing 3 makes the other non-released look horrrible. Problay paid the theee money to release certain details and withhold others
> But, he's also a former New Yorker, and as soon as Biden flamed out, he started talking about Bloomberg.  Guessing he isn't black or brown?
I hope you‚Äôre right. I hope he keeps digging his own hole.
[removed]
Or even if it was, like there were some expected number of harassment claims and he's doing a great job.  "Wow, look how *few* women he harassed!"
Every time I‚Äôm in that sub I just want to ask if the entire thing is a practical joke of some kind. I genuinely cannot imagine looking at the current field, seeing Bloomberg and thinking ‚Äúyep, that‚Äôs my top pick‚Äù.
> The Bloomberg sub (yes, it exists. Roughly 1.5k strong  I wonder if you get paid to join and participate? ü§î
I found a sub that is 1.7k and it‚Äôs called r/bloomberg. This is not a political sub it predates the election
I imagine after he did the first few, it became a standard operating procedure, or at least, some sort of shadow policy.
VERY Jewish ...  In fact, my Mother is part Greek, so I think I get bothered by the authorities more than he does.
I won't speculate the outcome of the election, but I know those that classify as Independent voters is what both parties need to win over and they tend to be the ones that don't live in echo chambers but also have fluid votes that go along with whatever the pressing issues are at that moment.
Guess we will have to wait until Super Tuesday, but polling is looking in Bernie's favor which will probably put him into being the majority, especially if Bloomberg, Klobachar, Pete, and Biden splitting the moderate votes.
It‚Äôs honestly insane how effective his money is in just blanketing all his baggage. I‚Äôll admit, when I saw I could get paid $15/h to tweet about him I really considered it for a second LMAO. But I know that kinda shit would still be helping getting him elected.   Christ, it even sounds like I‚Äôm shilling for him now.
Those are rookie numbers, total JV squad. Look at how many Donny T has! Now there's a man who knows how to harass a lady right there!  Only 3 in 30 years? What a loser.
Honestly for a company the size of Bloomberg Partners 3 cases in thirty years would genuinely be impressive.  That's not the case, though.
Honestly I just get bad vibes from him. I see his face and I feel like he‚Äôs a shark swimming into the coral reef. Like he‚Äôs just there for list for power.   If he does win, nothing would make me happier than to be proven wrong, and he‚Äôs spectacular. But he just radiates everything I dislike about America and politics lol
I went blockwalking for Warren two weeks ago in a nice neighborhood. I pretty sure these lists are of voters who voted dem in the last election. More than a few of them told me they were really republicans and were seriously considering Bloomberg as an alternative to Trump. He has ads on every channel in Texas. I'm also pretty sure these Republicans voted for Bernie in the Democratic primary in 2016 because they were trying to subvert Hilary. Republicans are very proud down here and outrighted bragged about doing this in 2016.  &#x200B;  Edit: These people intended to vote in the Democratic primary. I did actually sell one on Warren because she, like me, was a small business owner and I started going off about corruption and how difficult it is to compete against these big companies because they aren't playing by the rules.
That's how a lot of us felt about TD in 2015.
Some of them are literally getting paid to support him online. I generally avoid accusing people of being ____ shills, but his campaign openly advertises paying people to promote him on social media
Well there is a good chunk of the party that is statistically wealthy, white, male, and on the older side and to them he sounds reasonable. But I say this, do we want to compete with Trump in the old white rich guy dept, is that how any one wins 2020. Warren isn't my first choice but she certainly knows more about representing minorities than Bloomberg does and she didn't purchase her way into the field she has actual people who want her to win without being paid and she has pretty damn good policies that represent the working class.
r/presidentbloomberg
Do it wrong and cash your cheque man
Yeah you could accidentally do more harm than good and donate to you candidate of choice lol
Where did you see this job lmao
If you had just ended it with ‚ÄúSAD!‚Äù I would‚Äôve guessed you copied this from Trump‚Äôs Twitter feed.
Someone posted somewhere that maybe he‚Äôs running so that trump *could* win again and now I can‚Äôt take my tinfoil hat off.
Oh I see. That place is sus
Misc Reddit comments claiming that his campaign pays $15/h for ‚Äúdigital optics‚Äù aka shitposting about how great he is on twitter for 30 hours a week.
Andrew Yang: Elizabeth Warren deserves to be doing better than this.
Andrew Yang is a good guy. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Warren and Yang were the smartest people in the race :(  Edit and Pete.
The comments are insane
I am actually surprised she isn't doing better because she comes off as a good bridge candidate with moderates and progressives.
He is getting eviscerated for this on Twitter. There is something deeply troubling within the cult of personality that has sprung up from Bernie that they come at Warren as if she were Trump 2.0
Warren deserved to do better. She connected with smart people who wanted realistic progressive changes implemented with intelligent, strategic planning and a scalpel instead of just brute force and a bully pulpit.   Some are saying she ‚Äústole votes‚Äù from another candidate. Nope, she showed a better path forward and made people believe that progress can also be pragmatic.  In the end the loudest man in the room tends to drown out the academics and that‚Äôs the irony because while everyone talks about policy, It‚Äôs ultimately all about a cult of personality.
Well when a huge chunk of her support says   "Yeah she is amazing and I love her and she is smart.... But is she electable?" This happens.
Yang was my #1 and I voted for Warren yesterday. This makes me smile.
the comments are disgusting and insane but I won't say this means too much since honestly.. Yang seems to have just loved and respected pretty much all his former competition. Hell this was the guy who talked about missing Booker on stage. he backed Bernie in 2016 and seems to still like him but also clearly likes Joe. He's just a realy friendly guy who wishes everyone could do great it seems.
He's right
We all deserve Elizabeth Warren to do better. Her loss would be a loss for regular Americans.
Thanks Yang ‚ù§Ô∏è
In facing some of the hard truths as of lately, I hate to say it, but I think you have to be too informed and educated for Warren to be your preferred pick. Given how much propaganda is floating around undermining Warren's campaign, you need a lot of time to cut through the nonsense.   I still intend to vote for Warren and hope she runs it to the convention, though.
Nevertheless she persisted.  It is all about the size of fight in the dog, and she is got enough to fight till the end.  Disclaimer: Yanggang
He is right.
Yeah, it's so odd to me that she's not doing better that I feel like it's a conspiracy. When I look at the two old men leading the race, it makes me wonder why more wouldn't favor someone that's more youthful and has a track record of making differences.
Bernie should have dropped out after his heart attack and endorsed Warren. This could have been a completely different race.
Honestly, I was pretty undecided as to who would be my pick if it came down to Sanders or Biden, but the behavior of Sanders supporters has pretty much sealed it. I do think you can tell a lot about a candidate by the predominant behavior of their followers, and I am not liking what I'm seeing.
The bros are livid
This kind of stuff from his supporters makes me want to just write in Warren come November. It's irritating too, because in 2016, Bernie said he was running because Warren wouldn't, and now this is the situation we're in.
 I love Yang, he was my second choice candidate.      It is so disheartening that a big field of diverse intelligent candidates with so many fresh, big ideas has been winnowed down to two shouting old white guys :( The mainstream media has put their big fat thumb on the scale and chosen the political equivalent of plain yogurt for us.
I love Andrew Yang.  I hope we see and hear a lot more of him in the future
And here is why I'll be switching my support to Biden if Warren doesn't get the nomination. Id never give the Bernie cult any satisfaction
Exactly, she deserved to be recognized, and shown respect. She didn‚Äôt siphoning or steal any other candidates vote, she earned them and people chose her.
[removed]
As a Bernie voter, if there is a contested convention and Bernie is not in the lead, my hope is that he and Warren would have enough to put one of them over the top. And I hope Bernie would give his delegates to Warren. Voting with my heart causes me to go with Bernie (he was my senator when I lived in VT), but my head says Warren. And I think Bernie being selfless and getting behind her when all is said and done would be huge. As to why they both should stay in? I think Bernie staying in would net more delegates than if he dropped out, since most people see this as a two-way race. It would give Liz more delegates at the convention.
Warren definitely deserves to be doing better but the reality of the situation is she just lost her home state in third place.
I really appreciate Yang for saying this.  He's the only one.  We need to have people start bowing down to the woman single handedly tanking Bloomberg's campaign.
If he feels this way, shouldn‚Äôt he have endorsed her?
I agree. Warren drew only around 1 in 10 female voters in Massachusetts which blows my mind. She has a solid progressive background and knowledge of the issues. I‚Äôm sure a ton of analysis will happen in the coming weeks.
I don't like Yang.  His UBI initiative was the laziest, most bad-faith silicon valley privileged version of the concept.  But his kind words are appreciated.
I feel physical pain when I see how much of the kindness in this primary was lost with yang.   Now that yang is out and Warren is on shaky rails, this primary is taking too much of my energy. I was really eager to canvas and such, I was ready to go door to door like it was a thing to do.  Now I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôm going to be able to give besides my vote on Election Day. I‚Äôm just worn out, friends
Warren would make a great VP for Biden
Super Tuesday was rough for the Progressive wing of the Democratic Party. Joe Biden, riding high off an impressive win in South Carolina, and a slew of VIP endorsements, handily cleaned up last night.  Sanders may have won the lion's share of the biggest prize, California, but it remains to be seen how many candidates will be viable in the Golden State.  My knee jerk reaction last night was to feel anger towards Warren, for not dropping out and endorsing Sanders, when Pete and Amy did it for Joe. Or to feel depressed that so many eligible young voters stayed home after expressing such enthusiastic support for either Sanders or Warren. I kept thinking how insane it was that nearly half of voters in Virginia made up their mind on who to vote for in the last 48 hours.  This morning I thought about the likely future of this race. Joe Biden will be ahead in the Delegate count. Not by an insurmountable number, but he is the frontrunner to beat now.  Mike Bloomberg was embarrassed last night. He spent half a billion dollars to be non-viable in most contests, including Virginia where he spent at a higher-than-average clip.  He did so poorly I think there is a chance he may drop out and endorse Biden, pouring all that cash into Joe's coffers.  If that happens, what‚Äôs to be done? I think my anger towards Warren, who should be an ally, will not help. I want to be a Sanders supporter that builds with Warren supporters.
Not surprising that a guy who ran on a platform of being a guy who likes math would appreciate a woman with a detailed and nerdy plan for everything. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yeah, this is true. We talk about the racism and misogyny hurdles in this country but anti-intellectualism is a big one as well. If you are seen as "too smart", that is more likely a negative than a positive. Bonkers.
America could never get behind that
And Pete!  - signed, someone who supported him 99% of the way to Super Tuesday before jumping onto team Liz.
Warren was always my #1, and Yang was my #2 in case she dropped out.  Now I'm just sad that I have to vote blue reluctantly.  I believe any and all of these candidates are better than Trump, but it still sucks to vote reluctantly.
And Pete
Yang is apparently considering running for NYC mayor next year.
The smartest, but the average person is too dumb to realize it.
oh i think pete is demonstrably also a very intelligent person  absolutely hated his campaign, policies, etc.   but the dude is undeniably smart
And Cory.
Literally pathological. It's a form of brigading‚Äîand I'm sure Russia has nothing to do with the formation of it.
If you still want to bring yourself to vote for Sanders if he wins the nomination, don't go to the comments section on Warren's Facebook page.
The one that said:  "Warren is unlikable and she can't control her arms"  LOL, what?  Can't control her arms?  I had to laugh; this is a new Berner attack I've not heard of.
If we had ranked choice I think she‚Äôd be doing better. People need to consider ‚Äúelectability ‚Äú when voting under the current system. But if everyone votes based off what they thought others would do there‚Äôs a chance no one will choose their top, even if many others also consider them top.
Honestly, I think she wanted to be the candidate who would be liked by progressives because she is progressive but also liked by moderates because she isn't a Democratic Socialist, and she's loyal to the party. What ended up happening, because our politics are so fraught with divisiveness, is she was disliked by progressives for being loyal to the party and disliked by moderates for being too progressive. Which sucks because she is the best candidate
Same here! She literally checked off every box. She could bring progressive reforms and comfort the center that it will actually be better for them too.
Sanders supporter here (hope you don't mind me commenting), I think a lot of progressives are going for the further left Bernie with his grand platitudes and a lot of moderates are going with the safer, more 'reliable' Joe, leaving Warren in the middle in an election that's got everyone taking sides.  Another thing, I think earlier on, the media coverage would perk up for Buttigieg or Klobuchar and deride Sanders, giving them all coverage but leaving Warren with less.   Just my 2¬¢.
It‚Äôs because of CNN ‚Äútelling‚Äù us who the front runners were from the start and that we don‚Äôt have a proper voting system.
You know I like Bernie Sanders but there‚Äôs a part of me that makes me think some of his base thinks Trump is better than the other Democratic candidates.    That‚Äôs what gonna hurt us this November.
I don't get how Bernie voters can blame Warren for Sanders losing his lead. Biden had Bloomberg in his way moreso than Bernie has Warren and still won. Bernie Bros refusing to build a wider ideological tent is what killed them. I shifted my support from Pete to Joe but Warren is my true second choice and if I was voting today I'd have voted for her anyways. Here's hoping she plays a big part in whatever the next adminstration is.
Bernie supporters are building a cult of personality around Bernie. Anyone not on board is a threat and is to be attacked. I‚Äôve gotten that reaction from them.
That never go after Trump.  They are more likely to feel sorry for Trump voters and explain away white supremacy as the fault of democratic policies that failed the working white class men who they fetishize.  It's just gross.
Bernie is starting to look like Trump 2.0 at least his Bernie cult looks like a mirror image of the maga cult.

For many this is a fight for survival. Its has less to do with Warren and more to do with other factors.  Biden in my opinion, seems largely unserious about solving the large scale problems normal people have. It's not that hes a bad guy, it's just he doesnt exactly exude passion to actually reduce debt and provide a reasonable pathway for the younger generation to start building families. Obviously Trump is a dumpster fire. So people are adjusting to a reality where you have a dumpster fire vs Joe Biden, whatever that means to you.   In my opinion, Warren and Sanders were the only real serious candidates in this election. Theyre the only ones proposing comprehensive ideas to cover a broad range of issues. One has a slight shot to win the plurality of delegates and the other is looking like she might be building a case at a contested convention, but has largely underperformed in trying to accumulate delegates. Winning a contested convention would be a really sour way to win the nomination in my opinion.   I think this is just coming out as frustration. I for one am completely disheartened. By Warren's lack of success, by Sanders lack of success, and ultimately I worry about the general election as a consequence. I worry about an economic collapse. I worry about medical costs continuing to balloon. I worry that most millennials cant afford homes and are delaying starting families. I worry about wildlife and the environment. I worry about climate change.  I worry about the future of my kids.  I think beyond a political win for democrats, I think ultimately the results mean we lose overall. And I like Biden. I think in a different time we could do worse. But this is different times and I believe the worst challenges are ahead of us. His cognitive decline is troubling, but to be honest, I am just worried that he doesnt seem all too concerned about the pain of  normal people. And I feel that after 4 years of someone who could obviously give a rat's ass, we really need someone truly passionate.   Part of me wishes Warren would drop out and endorse Sanders and give us some hope. Part of me hopes she stays in so maybe we get a shot at the contested convention. But the future is ultimately very bleak.
They come at everyone like that. They don‚Äôt get it.  It‚Äôs like going to an peaceful anti war rally and then a small group shows up screaming anarchy and starts throwing bottles and rocks.
Seriously, a person cant even have an opinion (not even an endorsement!) without being a sell out, bought, changed, etc.
It is absolutely a popularity contest. We see this in student government elections as well. It sucks.
Those people were never her supporters. They were just reaching for yet another (albeit polite) reason to not vote for a woman.
He wants the democrats to band together and support each other. Because, in the end, I think that's the way we defeat Trump. At the moment it looks like it's not gonna happen. üòì
Yang's a good boy. I hope we see him again.
I remember him defending Steyer in a debate and the funny exchange of "thanks" "no problem, man." Yang is a good guy.

It‚Äôs really hard to avoid this feeling. But the way the media just.... didn‚Äôt report on her or comment on her (while extensively talking about people who finished behind her), and the way Biden suddenly came to the front when media started gushing about him... well it‚Äôs really, really hard not to get crusty about conspiracies.
I don't think it's a conspiracy. Simplest answers being often right; I think it's just good old fashion American misogyny.
It would have been the truly progressive thing to do.
So much for "not me, us."
Yup. Stepping aside and Elevating a woman to possibly be the first female president...that would have been the greatest act of allyship we‚Äôve ever witnessed. ‚ÄúNot me, us.‚Äù
Exactly. Many Sanders supporters don‚Äôt realize how much their vitriol pushes away those who they are actually trying to win over.
Considering that‚Äôs what a ton of Bernie supporters did in 2016 (wrote in Bernie instead of voting for HRC in the general), I do have to admit that it‚Äôs tempting.  But we really can‚Äôt let their behavior affect us. We need to do what they wouldn‚Äôt and get behind whomever the nominee is. We can‚Äôt afford four more years of Trump. Do it for RBG!
> makes me want to just write in Warren come November  Please reconsider this. The way the US electoral system is set up guarantees that voting for spoiler candidates is a losing strategy.   The future of millions of people depends on the disaffected to not vote with their egos.   Consider putting this energy in reforming your local and state laws to ensure we can vote with our conscience instead of compromising our ideals. Learn more at https://represent.us.
Did Bernie actually say that he ran because Warren couldn‚Äôt? I didn‚Äôt know that.
[removed]
Yeah, there have been some missteps. I love Elizabeth, but I think there have been some strategic choices made that turned out to be big mistakes. It‚Äôs disappointing. But it also would have been a much different race if Bernie had either not run after she announced her candidacy, or dropped out and endorsed her after his heart attack. This has all just not given me a lot of faith in the strength of the progressive movement in the US in general.
Agreed.  I was going to say this.  She'd make an excellent president, but she doesn't have the momentum at the moment.  I hope Biden picks her for VP if the opportunity arises.
Not sure why I‚Äôm getting downvoted. She deserves to be a national leader with executive powers.  If she gets on the Biden train, they would be a powerful force.  Also, she‚Äôs be one Corona virus away from the presidency!
The root of your anger is based in a misconception that most of us would've voted for Bernie if she dropped out. That's not likely. Bernie, his campaign, his surrogates, and his supporters burned that bridge with his ideological allies.   If she had dropped out, my vote would've gone to Biden. We don't all vote solely based on ideology. We're electing a leader, a President, not a set of policies.
Good to hear. There's a disturbing hivemind narrative in the Bernie bubble that "if only Elizabeth endorsed Bernie, he would've won," but it's just not so. Not everyone who voted for Warren had Bernie as a second choice- in  fact, only about 30% did. The remaining 70% were split among the moderates. Some of the would-be-Warren voters panicked and voted for Biden because they were  worried about Bernie losing to Trump (after all, Trump has been boosting Bernie; why else would he be doing that unless he thought he'd be easy to beat). Even after that, many of the remaining Warren votes STILL would've gone to Biden because she could attract the moderates that Bernie could not (and failed to build a bridge toward).
I really don't get it. To me, next to sharing progressive values, intelligence is the most important quality of a candidate. I couldn't care less how "inspiring" their speeches are, or about ridiculous purity standards, I care about who is best qualified to do the job. When it comes to complicated things like the healthcare system or foreign affairs, I want the smartest person in charge. I feel like I could do just as good of a job as Bernie as president, because talking is easy. I can give speeches on what's wrong with the system too. And that terrifies me because I would be a terrible president.
Seriously look at whos winning. Trump...Biden... not the smartest people in the room.
I think anti-intellectualism tends to get wildly misunderstood. I haven't seen anti-intelligence ever, at least not since maybe middle school.  What does exist is dislike of "intellectuals," not meaning people who are intelligent, but a sort of elitist snobbery. They think that the "intellectuals" look down on them, and a lot of the time they're correct.  If someone thinks that their upbringing means they're right and valuable and correct on every issue, and that your upbringing means that you're a garbage human whose highest use is following orders from the elites, you wouldn't like that person. (Of course not every intelligent person thinks that, but this is how the "intellectuals" are often perceived.)
Yea look at who won in 2016 and the dem frontrunner. Literally the dumbest people in the race.
> I believe any and all of these candidates are better than Trump, but it still sucks to vote reluctantly.  For me personally, I've never felt reluctant to vote in cases like this. I was enthusiastic about voting for Clinton and I still believe she would have been a great President. I'll be happy to vote for either Sanders or Biden in November along with all the downballot Dems.
Thank you for still voting.
Rumor with nothing backing it up. He's supposed to have a big announcement tomorrow, but it's going to be on The View, which would be an odd place to announce something like that.  I suspect the big thing people are waiting for will be the start of a foundation to provide UBI to mothers, care givers, etc. One of the points Yang consistently hit on the campaign trail was that a lot of important work gets valued at zero in our economy, and The View seems to fit as a place to announce it.  Apparently everyone in the DNC likes Yang, UBI has been quietly on the back burner (Hilary considered running on a UBI platform but the timing wasn't right), and a program to provide income to stay at home moms would win over tons of middle class women that Trump performed well with.
Hope he wins. But I dont live in NYC
I forgot about Cory. I really like him too.
Ignore it. Life is better when you just ignore shitty comments
Heck, don't go to THIS page, or any page on this subreddit. The mods have been working overtime, and can still see allllll the removed troll comments. Ironically, it's doing Bernie supporters a favor by making them look benign towards Elizabeth, when they definitely haven't been...
Or Warren's twitter feed. I feel sorry for her social media team.
For me, the online comments aren't the problem. It's when his surrogates get disingenuous and even nasty that I get pissed off.
It's a real shame to see progressives fight each other, and to see Warren and Sanders do so little publicly to stop it. I get that they need to compete, but you can feel the lack of solidarity among leftists in America. I think a lot of it comes down to bad-faith outsiders using the freedom of online anonymity to destroy positive discourse in the Democratic primary, and quite a few progressives have fallen victim to this trap.
I am strongly considering not voting.  I hope Elizabeth is still in it when my state finally votes (one of the last ones üëø), but if not, I don't think I really want to be partly responsible for either Biden or Bernie being the nominee.  I used to think I would go for Bernie, but not after the way his supporters have acted.  Then I vote blue in the general.
Bernie has the wingspan of a condor. We see him fly at every debate.
Pot calling the kettle black, too.

Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   Caucus: February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
Excited to see her get another surge! The stats speak for themselves, Bernie and biden both have good numbers too but they also have higher unfavorable numbers. Warren is the one that people will accept after their first choice drops out.
I think Warren's whole national game is impressive. I got a call from one of her phonebankers after I donated, for the first time ever! Not donations, contact I mean. I have donated to Sanders both this time and last time as well, as well as several other candidates over the years, so I was rather surprised to hear from the Warren campaign.
I hope a win in Iowa can translate to a win in NH as well.
Sucks you have to subscribe to read these articles... I wish Washington post would just sell advertising (like every other website in the world) to make their revenue.
Good stuff, loving it. Before Iowa nobody thought Obama had a chance, so we need this
[removed]
What does it mean to be unmatched? I'm a Warren supporter, but am just curious about what it's like in Iowa right now pre January.
What makes her campaign stand out against Sanders and Biden to Iowan?
Lol
Advertising revenue is not enough to support real journalism of the scope that WaPo does. Their peer publications also require a subscription.
WaPo is the only newspaper I pay for subscription for. If you have Amazon Prime you can get one for $3.99/month. For me it‚Äôs more than worth it for the amount of news I get from them.
You can always just open in an incognito window....
Both outline.com and archive.is allow you to thwart the paywall. Both services are free.
There are ways to get past it.  I use Feedly to read articles, and they extract the text for you without actually requiring you to enter the website.
I had no problem reading this article through this link on my phone. I use the baconreader reddit app, for what it's worth.
This is why i prefer Politico. They're actually pretty unbiased in that they view DC as a Game of thrones series.
I do wonder about the difference in dynamic here.  Obama‚Äôs major issue pre-Iowa is that Clinton was slaughtering him among black voters, because many of them thought white Americans wouldn‚Äôt elect a black president. Obama‚Äôs win in Iowa demolished that notion, and soon after he started pulling ahead of Clinton among black voters which is important for South Carolina in particular.  Warren still has to somehow break through to black voters if she‚Äôs going to compete with Biden in South Carolina and other states across the south.
That‚Äôs a bullshit cowardly attack.  Don‚Äôt divide the Dem candidates, you‚Äôre doing Trump a huge favor
[deleted]
[deleted]
Sanders and Warren are very different from Biden as far as political plans. Biden is more moderate, whereas Sanders and Warren are more progressive and have their plans laid out plainly on their websites.
Then WaPo should become a nonprofit and ask for donations. I will never pay a for-profit corporation to tell me information that is my inherent right as a human to have. It‚Äôs absolutely absurd that someone makes a profit off of public-interest journalism.
They are the only ones I pay for as well, but that's primarily because their app is the best lol  I'd rather have NYT but ah well
Why can‚Äôt I up vote more than once?!?!?
I downloaded the BaconReader app thanks!
I agree that the comparison isn't very strong, for the reasons you cited. I just want to point out, in case you're like me and have been waiting for movement on that front, that few people noticed that her support among black voters is starting to rise in South Carolina. People go straight to that horse race poll showing Biden leading 40-10, but 10% is a big change for Warren. That's slightly less than half her support among white voters in SC. If Biden had a more reasonable lead, like 25-10, it would look a lot like the national race back in May. And then you have articles like [this one](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/us/politics/joe-biden-black-voters.html).
Dude, his response to a question about the history of slavery was that black parents don't know how to parent... "They just don't know quite what to do"... Then he went on about record players and sending social workers to black peoples' homes to teach the parents. What are you going on about?
[removed]
It‚Äôs still the primary. I‚Äôm not here for Biden.
[deleted]
> I see Warren organizers and volunteers everywhere.  Are they mostly women or both men and woman?
I think she/he was asking about the local campaign in Iowa and why they think it stands out compared to the others, not why she stands out policy wise
Everyone has the right to sell their content as they see fit, and I'm more than willing to pay for it.   I think we should have more publically-funded journalism, but we're always going to have private news agencies. That's just the way it goes.
High-calibre journalists deserve to make a decent living, no?
You think all these journalists‚Äô salaries are just gonna appear out of thin air?
Yeah, I think we're on the same page. I'm just not sure that a strong Iowa performance will be the right kind of catalyst for her to break through with black voters; it'll take something else, probably. Maybe strong results in Iowa + New Hampshire AND when people start paying more attention to the race would do it. But she'll definitely need to do better than 40-10 among black voters vs. Biden if she's going to be the nominee.
Generally, former presidents don't endorse. Like, Bill endorsed Hillary for obvious reasons, but that's an exception
I love that Biden says he is "sure he could have beat Trump in 2016" and later says he had to drop after getting less than 1% of the Iowa vote. That's not possible winning that's losing miserably. Regardless, I don't agree with the article or a lot of people's attacks on him. He's a competent politician and would be awesome in quite a few roles on the national scale. He just isn't the right person for the presidency in my opinion. Not this election, anyways. Not because he's incompetent, but because we have the chance for real change in a positive way for the first time in a long time, and he's not the one promising it.
Attack his record there‚Äôs plenty there.
Tearing down other candidates does nothing for our candidate, in fact it harms her. Take Warren‚Äôs conduct as an example.
I'm /u/avnerd's second opinion and removing this comment.  Posting opinion pieces that clearly state they can't comment on his health to claim he's not mentally competent isn't political debate, it's just mudslinging.
From the opinion piece you linked to "I have never examined the former vice president, and so I cannot comment directly on his health. " And yet he goes on to do just that.   I have to ask if it, and your comment, is against rule 3 or 4 of this community and while the opinion is an educated one I think your summation of the link "not mentally competent" is against rule 3. I'm waiting for a second opinion before removing your comment. Please feel free to edit your comment to be civil.
I think Biden‚Äôs age is truly an issue, but Obama obviously isn‚Äôt endorsing him because he‚Äôs a former president, and they traditionally don‚Äôt endorse anyone until after the primaries are over.
Past presidents don't endorse candidates in primaries. It's unfair to the process.
I'm just saying that if and when Biden goes negative, it's going to accelerate his campaign's implosion.
No one here is, but bullshit attacks not related to his terrible record are cowardly, lame and only help Trump.
I haven‚Äôt seen her speak in person, but I don‚Äôt get how anyone who watches her speak doesn‚Äôt immediately fall in love with her candidacy.  All those early takes about her lacking ‚Äúcharisma‚Äù and not connecting with voters were so confusing to me. I felt like I was taking crazy pills‚Äîare we watching the same woman?
I volunteer in Michigan, and it's about even.
Ah yes I see that now
This.
No, nobody has the right to sell anything. The information and content WaPo produces was made by humans, and as such is the property of all humans ‚Äî information can never be owned by anyone. We need to eliminate these backwards, capital-focused ways of thinking in order to move into a truly equal future.  Under your philosophy, someone with less money has less of a right to be informed about the world. How does that make any sense?
For sure. I think the change will be slow, though, like every other part of her success. No big tipping point; just one day we'll wake up and it'll be a dead heat.
I hope primary voters can come to the awareness that we haven‚Äôt had a successful Democratic presential nominee who didn‚Äôt run as an agent of change since 1996.  We can‚Äôt go back or keep things steady state
There's also plenty there whenever he opens his mouth, we ignore his current state at our own peril. It is absolutely not off the table to point out how he can't string a coherent sentence together anymore.  This is a primary. Nothing is off limits. Save the hand-holding for after.
Thank for the second opinion, especially since they didn't edit.
There‚Äôs a difference between not endorsing and asking Biden not to ‚Äúembarrass himself.‚Äù
Attack his record, don‚Äôt stoop to Trump‚Äôs level
I don‚Äôt see a downside.
Bullshit. This is currently a competition. It‚Äôs an election. Biden being the candidate helps Trump. That‚Äôs a truth right there.
[deleted]
This is a phenomenally dumb argument. The actual poll is free and offered online [here](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/09/21/desmoinescnnpoll.pdf) (although even if it wasn't polls are still costly to conduct in terms of money/manhours and so expecting someone to contribute to support those costs as a term of accessing it feels reasonable).   What this article does is break down key results from this poll and inform readers why, in the opinion of the newspaper, these results are important. This is a service that writers are providing to the readers that they have no external obligation to provide and so requesting some amount of support to continue providing it is fair. You're making a pretty big leap from "people have a right to information relevant to their lives" (with which I broadly agree) to "other people have an obligation to collect and digest that information for me" (which is unreasonable). It makes as much sense as going from "people have a right to food and sustenance" (with which I, and I would hope, most people agree) to "you, /u/TyphoonOne have an obligation to cook dinner for me" (which is unreasonable).
I was gonna go into a longer response, but I'm just gonna stick with saying this is a dumb take. There's no point you made that more publically-funded media wouldn't fix.
What right do you have to say that someone else does not have the right to sell their labor?  There are lots of ways to organize a society, but the one you are proposing is substantially less free than the society we have today.
THIS.
In the E Warren sub there is a rule about not dividing Democrats,  you want to assist Trump? Keep on dividing.  We‚Äôll need Biden supporters after the primary.
Attacking other candidates is poor strategy. Obviously most people here have chosen to support Warren, so it‚Äôs unlikely they need to hear the negatives about other candidates in order to be convinced of her bonafides.
Stoop to whatever level wins the election. Kids are being locked up and forced to menstruate through their clothes. Going high for a Pyrrhic victory dooms those children.
Have some faith that we can take over the lead without those attacks, and then when it comes time for the general we won't have alienated any of his supporters.
The polls are shifting to Warren without descending into negativity. She‚Äôs going to win, do you want Biden voters to vote for her or be so angry they stay home
You‚Äôre doing the dividing and pushing out supporters by saying we can‚Äôt have an opinion about Joe Biden‚Äôs ability to do the job. ‚Äò‚ÄòTis conversation has made me unsubscribe and stop my monthly donations to the Warren campaign. My opinion matters and my voice matters and I‚Äôm not here for Joe Biden. Goodbye.
Worked great in 2016!
Well I‚Äôm alienated now. Why do I always have to acquiesce?  I‚Äôll vote for Biden if I have to but I don‚Äôt support him.  If I have to blindly support Joe Biden to be a part of the Elizabeth Warren campaign then I won‚Äôt do that.   Edit I see what it‚Äôs going to be like. I‚Äôll just unsubscribe to the subreddit.  I‚Äôm not here for Joe Biden. So now I‚Äôm just not here. I won‚Äôt donate or volunteer. Have a nice election.
[deleted]
We're sorry to see you go, but this policy isn't changing.  We're not representatives of the Warren campaign, but we feel strongly about not letting the overheated division of 2016 take root here.  The negative stories will surely get their play elsewhere, but the purpose of this sub is promoting Warren, not tearing down her opponents.
There's no reason to stop supporting Warren just because some of her supporters act in a way you do not agree with. I agree we should be allowed to say what we will about Biden, but this reddit is run by Warren supporters, to my knowledge. Not the campaign itself.
Yup! We went high and now Hillary is president! Because being civil wins elections!
If all it would take to not support a candidate that you want to be president is that people were mean to you on the internet, I have serious doubts that your intention to support her was ever genuine.
Not making personal attacks on Biden isn‚Äôt supporting him.  But yes, you should have a basic level of support for him because you‚Äôre going to turn around and ask Biden supporters to vote for Liz in the general
No one is asking you to blindly support Biden, we're just asking you to not personally *attack* Biden. There's a huge amount of area in between those options. Clearly not many of us here particularly agree with Biden on many issues, but ultimately once a candidate is chosen we are all on the same team and we don't want to see a repeat of 2016 where each half of the party completely alienated the opposite. It's possible to disagree with Biden while being civil and not being divisive.
Way to miss the entire point.
It seems to be mainly run by Warren volunteers. I‚Äôve worked as a staffer on a senate campaign, so I‚Äôm assuming a lot of her interns are in this subreddit working the votes. I‚Äôll vote for Warren in the primary and if she makes it to the general I‚Äôll vote for her. But my donations are stopped because I‚Äôm not here to support Joe Biden. And if this is all just staging to get us all to switch to Biden when he wins the primary, no thank you.  This subreddit has made me rethink being involved in this election as a volunteer at all. I do not feel like this will be an election which cares about people who aren‚Äôt mainstream regular, and this subreddit has proven that to me.
We did not go high, what the fuck are you talking about?
Well, I don‚Äôt want to support something just to be told that now I have to support someone or something else that I don‚Äôt like because of it.   So if supporting Warren means I have to support Biden, I‚Äôll just focus on things I can believe in.
Saying someone is mentally unwell and not able to do the job is not a personal attack. That‚Äôs a fact about Biden‚Äôs ability.
Saying someone can‚Äôt do the job because they are unwell is not a personal attack.
why because they said 'don't make fun of joe biden' you think all this. i think that's a bit much  ...tbh like i'm pro 'shit on biden' as much as the next person but i don't think there's anyway to tell if her official staff have any real power on this subreddit. also there's no guarantee biden is going to win either, because as we've discussed to death he's falling in the polls and can't even speak coherently anymore so there's that too. i'm sorry but i don't quite get what the beef is here
Of course we did.
Please take that toxicity elsewhere. Unless you are a doctor with personal knowledge of his mental health, it‚Äôs speculation.   Outside of sharing Warren-related content, this is a subreddit for discussing policy. Infighting is not welcome. Please be kind.
...yes that is a personal attack. Saying that someone is unwell (especially when there's no substantial evidence of that) is a personal attack. And regardless of whether that specifically is a personal attack, you seem to be advocating that you *should be allowed to* personally attack him. And have said that you've basically stopped supporting Warren *because* people have asked you not to be divisive.
The DNC didn‚Äôt change the rules to ensure good, diverse candidates could remain on the debate stage. They shouldn‚Äôt change the rules to let a billionaire on. Billionaires shouldn't be allowed to play by different rules‚Äîon the debate stage, in our democracy, or in our government.
This might get down voted here but the DNC changed the rules to force Bloomberg onto that stage. They were worried he would run away by buying up all the airtime and not giving the other candidates a chance to attack him on stage.
I am glad they are forcing Bloomberg on to the stage. This is not good for his campaign. And just from a logical standpoint it makes perfect sense to change the qualifying thresholds to reflect, you know, actual results.
Weren't campaigns wanting the rules to change to force Blomberg into the debates?
Call me crazy, but I like this. Nobody likes Bloomberg. Plus Bernie and Warren are going to tee off on this obvious corrupt horse shit.   Say what you will about Steyer, the guy put in the work to get enough grassroots support.
It doesn't bother me as much that they're letting Bloomberg on the stage as it does that it's just going to be the same debate format for the 100th time, with too many people on-stage, with slight variations of the same questions, and all the candidates giving slight variations of answers they've already given.  I want to see a series of 1-on-1 debates that would give us a better sense of how each candidate would perform during a general election head-to-head debate.
Getting to call out the DNC for elevating billionaires and not POC? Win.  Getting to trash Bloomberg on stage either way? Win.   These are what we call good optics.
Bloomberg needs to face scrutiny, which is why he should be on the debate stage.
I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about this. I‚Äôm happy that Bloomberg can finally get some heat. At the same time, I wish the rules could have been bent earlier so that Castro and Booker could have had a bigger role. Then again, the field needed to be narrowed down. Then again, there‚Äôs only one candidate left that I still like (Warren lol)...
It seems pretty crazy that a guy could be polling at 10%+, and making *massive* ad buys, and not appear at any debate. Would it look good to have a nominee that skipped all the debates and avoided all direct questioning? Or allow someone that won enough delegates through ad buys alone to trigger a contested convention? *That‚Äôs nuts*.   Honestly I always thought the donation criteria was a distasteful idea - it should have been based on polling alone, not money. And now that we are finally at the point where actual delegates are being won it makes sense to change the rules to focus on actual and potential delegate strength.
[Yang just echoed a similar sentiment](https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1223413663693987841?s=20)
TBH, I'm fine with the rules change, I think if Bloomberg's entry hurts anyone, it'll be Biden, and that'll create some opening for actual progressive candidates.
I don't expect he'll take many votes from Warren/Sanders. Definitely more from Biden/Buttigieg/Klobuchar. This could help the progressive wing if he takes enough votes from Biden but stays under 15% in most states.
I hope they all attack Bloomberg for buying his way onto the debate.
Can he just skip the debates and say it‚Äôs not part of his strategy? I mean it‚Äôs not like he needs the exposure. Going to the debates only opens him to criticism as others have said. I must admit I fear that this action to bend the rules for a billionaire will become a Republican attack line to ‚Äòboth sides‚Äô the corruption argument.
This is good. The DNC rules shouldn't prevent someone getting ~10% support from getting on stage. The donor metric was always a stupid one.
[removed]
He's the real life Monty Burns
I totally agree,  there's no way I'm voting for Bloomberg
Hear hear!
I don't like it and Bloomberg makes my skin crawl, but I agree with you.  He's polling into double-digits in A-rated polls, and while I can't understand why some democrats are angling for a milquetoast moderate billionaire who bought his way onto the stage, he needs to be in the debates now.  The Booker situation was a little different, in that while he had passed the donor qualification, his polling had dropped to around 1%.
I think this assumes that the moderators will give the other candidates an opportunity to critique him. And set up the questions so that they can. I‚Äôm not sure the DNC will allow this.
I mean I think it's fair hes on stage since he has a sizable showing in polls. He should receive the same ridicule as everyone else does.
I kind of feel bad for him. He is going to get skewered on stage in front of a national audience.  In a more serious note, he needs to be made an example of. As a party we can't tolerate anyone running a national campaign because they are sooooo offended by where the party is headed. Senator Warren made a good point that Bloomberg thinks its cheaper for him to run a presidential campaign and run ads rather than pay wealth taxes.  I am glad that Bloomberg is in the debate. I hope all the candidates form a Voltron like electoral candidate and vivisect him on the national stage.
Riiiight, because lobbing tons of negative press is an effective way of stopping a candidate who is totally unqualified......  If anything this just helps him by giving him more exposure. Name recognition wins elections and putting him on the debate stage legitimizes his campaign.   Also, why are we ignoring the MASSIVE donation he made to the DNC prior to this? He bought his way on stage, don't make excuses for the  DNC, who are actively trying to help Trump get reelected...Again.
If I had to guess he might've been counting on that.
I am ok with him showing up if he has a large bump up on the polls. Let us see what he has to say.
Yeah but Bloomberg can always just decline, staying he‚Äôs doing his campaign his way on his terms.  The whole thing just makes the DNC look bad.
>I am glad they are forcing Bloomberg on to the stage. This is not good for his campaign.  I mean. Is it?   This will msot definitely boat Jim in the polls.   Just being present will boost people. That's we push for things like rule changes and allow more voices in the debate, especially third party candidates in general elections?  > And just from a logical standpoint it makes perfect sense to change the qualifying thresholds to reflect, you know, actual results.  So they could have changed the rules depending on anything, and they chose to do on money.
Yeah, but dunking on the DNC and billionaires at the same time is like free votes.  Might be in the minority here but I think a minimum donor threshold was a dumb idea to start with, if someone can poll 10% nationally they should be on the stage regardless of how they fund their campaign. I actually really liked Booker and Castro but they and others had their shot in the debates and couldn't get anywhere with it. Bloomberg might be basically buying his votes, but if he's able to fool 10% of voters he should be on the stage (hopefully so other candidates can rag on him face to face until he fades back into irrelevance).  That's completely aside from the fact that if he wanted to be in the debates, he'd be there. You can buy donors by investing in fundraising as easily as you can buy poll numbers. Bloomberg doesn't have them because he doesn't want them, not because he couldn't get them. He'd rather spend truckloads of cash to get a message out uncontested via ads than go on a debate stage for free and have to defend himself.
Source of claim (1/28): https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/28/bloomberg-progressives-leftists-2020-dnc-106712   **Progressive allies of Elizabeth Warren have approached the Democratic National Committee to lobby for an unusual cause: including billionaire Mike Bloomberg in upcoming presidential primary debates.**  **The move, described to POLITICO by a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, reflects the desire of liberal activists to pin down the former New York mayor, who has avoided verbal combat with his opponents by waging a self-funded campaign that plays by its own rules. But the entreaty also speaks to progressives' growing unease with Bloomberg's relative success: After spending hundreds of millions of dollars, he has vaulted into double digits in national polls and amassed a giant staff of A-level operatives.**
> Plus Bernie and Warren are going to tee off on this obvious corrupt horse shit.  He can't go to the debate and not get absolutely shit on... right?
Let's not forget racist bullshit. Stop and frisk happened largely under him.
I have a mild respect for Steyer. He‚Äôs so awkward but it seems like he has a good heart.
If we're lucky he'll split the Biden vote.
I don't see more than 5 candidates hitting 10% anywhere.   It really is just Biden, Bernie, Warren, Iowa Winner (Pete/Klobachar), and maybe Bloomberg.   I guess Steyer might pull it off too but I would be shocked if there were more. It is also possible that all 5 traditional candidates get delegates in Iowa, but in that case we should hear from all of them.
I want more town hall style debates. I feel like questions at these rallies from from generic Iowans were far superior than the questions proposed by the moderators.
Yang was a diverse candidate the DNC shoved out by raising the polling limits without there being any qualifying poles between debates. Changing that rule in the face of no new poles would NOT have been just to keep people of color on the stage, it would have been recognizing the reality of polling.  They don't need to allow these guys in, but it's not like "let's change it so people of color can get in" was a thing either.
[removed]
Yang is right. Steyer was masterful in hitting his donor requirements. It isn't hard to set up an Anti-Trump shop and get 300k sales, especially with Bloomberg's budget.
I don‚Äôt think skipping a debate he qualifies for would be a good look. People would think, ‚Äúthis is the guy that is supposed to be the one to take on Trump? A guy afraid to do a Democratic debate?‚Äù
Having him as part of the debate takes time away from other people on the stage. It also dilutes the messaging and allows for it to seem like the corporatist perspective is far more common than it actually is. Essentially, this makes the number of progressives voices vs non-progressive voices on the stage a different ratio than what it would be otherwise. It also gives the airtime of moderate voices more time than progressive voices. And giving Bloomberg the power to either attend or not makes no sense whatsoever.  It's 100% okay if there are more moderates on stage *if they qualified like everyone else*. But literally rigging things to allow Bloomberg on the stage like this is despicable regardless of what positive or negative effect it has.  *It's not about the effect.* It's about the act itself.
It's because he is milquetoast and moderate. Millions and millions of voters want a return to normalcy and he is selling that. It's an important constituency that needs to be assuaged and recognized and folded into what coalition forms in a few months.
[removed]
and if the opposite happens, and they protect him... feed him slow ball questions.. it will almost certainly bolster him further
"He needs to be made an example of"??  No, he needs an opportunity to debate.    He isn't running for President to avoid wealth taxes; that would be incredibly stupid.  Warren's logic here that it was a mistake for the DNC to not change the rules before means that they should not change the rules now is equally stupid.  Two wrongs make a right?  What?
In a vacuum if you told me that once voting starts it will be the primary decider over who gets on the debate stage I would say that makes perfect sense; votes should matter more then anything else. I‚Äôm not going to change my opinion of that just because a billionaire is the beneficiary.
This is notably not the Warren campaign, same with Zephyr Teachout and Bernie.  Supporting groups are allowed to have their own position on things.
I came here to post this. This is behavior from the left towards the DNC, being easily manipulated by bad actors and toxic people as per usual.
This feels like the DNC trying to get the bat-shit Republican candidates, like Trump to become the nominee because they thought it would be easy pickings.
Which was a policy that he fully supported up until last year. He basically said it was great and very effective until he decided to run for President.
Not just racist, unconstitutional too
Calling him names is a great argument.  We do need better candidates, but Bloomberg is more qualified than several of the others. Mayor of New York City versus mayor of South Bend, Indiana?  No contest.
That would make sense if he wanted to be president. But what if he just wants to get enough delegates so he can be kingmaker at a brokered convention or have enough influence over the Democratic Party‚Äôs nominee‚Äôs policies? He‚Äôs pulling 10% barely saying a word. That might be enough for him.
Trump skipped a Republican debate in 2016, so Bloomberg would have the perfect answer to that.
I agree with you 100%.
I understand you are passionate, but we must avoid name calling.     Removed: Dividing Democrats
But three rights make a left....  (The joke is from Red Green...)
It took until after he entered the race to apologize for it, and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if he didn't mean that shit in the slightest.
He‚Äôs not going to get any delegates at 10%. All of the media attention is going to be on results and debates now with impeachment wrapping up, and simply spamming ads won‚Äôt be enough to counter balance the media coverage that the front runners will start to get.
Trump also was leading in the polls for about 6 months leading up to the Iowa caucus and participated in every other debate. Bloomberg entered late, is fourth in the polls (could easily slide to 5th if Pete has a strong showing in Iowa), and has yet to be on the stage; so if Bloomberg tries to use that talking point I think it will fall flat.
Yeah, I remember him apologizing for it in...November? I think. So still last year, but around the time he was starting all this primary crap. But before that he was still a cheerleader for it.   He didn't mean the apology at all. It was politically prudent for him to fake remorse. He's always been that way. This is the same guy who changed term limits to give himself a 3rd time. NYers mostly loathe him. I know I do.
I mean he‚Äôs pulling 10% now. I‚Äôve seen some polls where he‚Äôs higher. Remember the threshold is also per precinct so he‚Äôll definitely get delegates in place like New York etc. Time will tell how well his ad spamming will work. To be honest we‚Äôve never seen it on this level before.
10% *now*, after only 2 months. That quarter billion dollars in ad spending is clearly working for him and he‚Äôs just getting started. It totally dwarfs the other candidates, and is literally making ad rates go up for them. For comparison [from 538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-campaign-ads):   - Bloomberg $228M - Steyer $122M - Sanders $10.7M - Buttigieg $9.12M - Yang $8.42M - Warren $4.39M - Biden $3.32  Bloomberg outspent frontrunner Biden by almost *2 orders of magnitude*.
The threshold is per Congressional District in Primary states.
Yea, his RCP polling average is at 8.1% now.... You think he is going to rise in the polls getting 0 delegates in Iowa and NH and being absent from the NH debate?
Well that certainly looks like a healthy and functioning democracy.
Oh true that does makes me feel a bit better. But after Trump won I no longer ignore worst case scenarios. Bloomberg vs Trump would, to me at least, signify the end of democracy in this country.
After Trump I don't rule out the infinite capacity of the American voter to willfully vote against their own self interest.
Imagine if Bloomberg and Steyer spent that $350 million on voter registration and turnout and down ballot candidates. The positive impact would be tremendous.
It‚Äôs not a capacity for the American voter to willfully vote against their self interest thing, it‚Äôs a timing thing. Trump may have ‚Äúcome out of nowhere‚Äù in a general sort of way, but he announced at the beginning of the race like any ‚Äúnormal‚Äù candidate, and was leading in the polls by the end of the summer in 2015. People are severely underestimating the effect the first four states are going to have on the race as far as media coverage and momentum with voters. 1-3 candidates are going to get very significant bumps in the polls this month while he remains stagnant. He can buy ads in February, but he can‚Äôt buy delegates and (perhaps more importantly) media coverage in February. Bloomberg may dominate the commercial breaks in the Super Tuesday states this month, but 1-3 candidates not named Bloomberg will be dominating the news cycle.
College students favor Elizabeth Warren over Bernie Sanders for the first time in 7 months
[deleted]
Genuinely curious to see if the AOC endorsement will make this swing back.
poll was likely before the last debates when people were more unsure of Bernie's health status. Hopefully it holds up :)
College student should favor voting first and foremost. I don't care who wins among them as long as they fucking vote.
I think if it's either Bernie or Warren we can get a big youth turnout and a lot of young people campaigning for her in the general, kind of like we got with Obama.
I'm not excited with how messy this is going to be.
I love them both.
The more people that check her out, the more likely they are to consider her.  Also, I'm sure economics courses have started and that might have something to do with it. ;)
Not like it matters, college students barely vote. My peers are so apathetic to politics it's honestly super disheartening.
I'm a college student fully prepared to vote for whichever one of the two has the best shot by the time the primary rolls around to my state.
I love both Sanders and Warren, I think Warren needs to be more adamant about how she will put these plans into place. She's still playing the politician stance of giving plans without implementation (not on all things) I would like her to not only put forth a direct way to pay for everything but stand by it on the stage. It was rough seeing her not answer the question of will middle class incomes increase and then just say no. That's a lie they will and she should be adamant that it's fine because they will pay less overall in everything else
Why don‚Äôt they just run together.
I‚Äôm not against Warren per say, but I do really hope that Bernie can get that support back.
Yes.
[removed]
There were only 1500 respondents. This is good news but don't read too much into it.
[removed]
Exactly. I've seen an uptick in the efforts to pit the Democrats against each other, and I don't see the point (unless the goal is to bring down Dems altogether). Right now I'm rooting for Warren, and I have no interest in finding faults with Bernie. I'll vote for whoever wins the nomination.
I am too, but I have a preference for Warren.
Yuuuuuuuup.  The country would be immeasurably better with either one
That's why I'm subbed to both this and Sanders' sub.
For real, either of them would be GREAT
I like Sanders a lot - I voted for him in my 2016 primary. I much prefer Warren but I'd be fine with Sanders as the nominee.
I'll be honest in saying Sanders is my #1 choice as of right now but Liz is my #2 and I'm happy to be on this sub to hear her ideas and continue to see how she's doing. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Yang's sub though. I like Yang a lot but too much of his supporters (at least on Reddit) are Trump apologizers and frankly people's posts were grating on me. I still hope he sticks around and contributes his ideas but goddamn does he have some annoying supporters.  I just want someone to win who actually cares about and will actually help the common person and I would be estactic if Liz won the nomination even if she isn't technically my first choice because I think she will do exactly that.
I'm fine with Sanders or Warren or Biden or Buttigieg or Harris or Klobuchar, etc...
Warren is great, but I‚Äôm poor enough for the difference to matter, so I‚Äôll vote for Sanders.
Personally, I would offer prefer to not vote for Sanders. I think that fundamentally, Sanders thinks of capitalism as a hurdle to social change where Warren sees it as a means to leverage partnerships to kickstart change.
I can't see Biden getting 50% of the vote outright to gain an outright majority at the convention. But I can see Biden and others like Buttigieg and Harris doing so and propping Biden up in exchange for cabinet spots. So there's no way I can support any of them.  I also can't see Warren or Sanders getting the majority solo either. I think both camps need the other to get enough 15%+ delegate shares so they can support each other, maintain that over 50% combined vote and block the centrists.  If Sanders or Warren fail to do that, you're looking at President Biden.
I'll admit, the AOC endorsement has shifted my leaning towards Bernie. Still prefer this subreddit tho. Y'all are polite.
(Anecdotal) All my friends that supported Bernie before his heart attack were unshaken by his heart attack. I think this is just a matter of Warren getting more name recognition and recognition of her policies. For most college students I know, their default is Bernie.
Regardless, this is great momentum. Shows that Warren is capable of showing the same progressive strength that our new generation covets as Sanders does.
Also before the high profile endorsements he received these past couple days.
he was doing poorly before his health issue as well
[removed]
It's literally just numbers.
What does economics courses have to do with anything?
How can you have Donald Trump as the President, have record college tuition prices and decide to stay out of politics?
is there a typo in this? Also I don't recall her saying no to anything like that at all.
Uh, she supports all of those things.
That‚Äôs a pretty solid sample size?
that's pretty large actually, statistically
Why are you like this
I've been trying to counter this narrative as best I can by referring to them as the Teacher and the Preacher. In this progressive movement we're building, we're going to need them both. We're going to need their strength, their vision, and their advocacy. Ideally, I'd like a unity ticket with whichever wins the most delegates as president and the other as VP, but I'll also settle for the other as senate majority leader when this all shakes out.  Edit: wow, my first silver post is a triple stack! Thanks y'all :D
Yeah I'm perfectly fine with people saying they like one or the other better, or even saying that they dont really like a certain candidate for x reason.  It becomes a problem and very toxic if they are being overly down on a candidate and blowing up minor problems into major problems or spreading baseless rumors or thinly veiled Republican talking points :"But Bernie/Warren are going to RAISE YOUR TAXES!!!!" (Neglecting to talk about the value of what the taxes are being used for or how much it will potentially save).  I cant even count the number of posts I see starting with "I was feeling the Bern in 2016, but..." And ending with "Honestly if they keep going like this I might even not vote or vote for Trump!"  Or some variation like that.
God I love how positive this sub is. It's a refreshing change from r/politics.
It's always from these self-proclaiming *BernieBros* which at this point I believe are just bad actors from the right trying to sow division and who have no legitimate interest in this primary. I'm in no way insinuating that all Bernie supporters are like this.  It all reeks of the same divisive tactics used last time with the whole Bernie or bust crap. I voted for him in the 2016 primary but like hell was I going to sit and pout just because he didn't get the nomination.
would this comment be upvoted in any sanders sub?
I‚Äôm the exact same, but the other way around. I prefer Bernie, but I‚Äôll vote for Liz happily if she‚Äôs the nom.
What is "poor enough"?
I have no idea know what you‚Äôre talking about to be honest. I don‚Äôt think you understand either candidate‚Äôs economic policy if you think this.
Unlike (and interestingly enough), Twitter.
(Anecdotal Counterpoint) A lot of my friends who supported Bernie are now supporting Warren after the heart attack. I would include myself, but I'm not a citizen and can't vote :P

Youth turnout has always been low, there are a few main reasons:  1) They're new to voting. The transition from child mostly insulated from politics to adult capable of voting is very sudden. Voting, which is anyway an infrequent thing, is not something they have been exposed to and thus are used too.  2) Politics is mainly about old people concerns. Healthcare, taxes and most of the stuff that dominates political debates is mainly the concerns of older people. Politics about tuition costs, the environment and the concerns of young people will boost youth turnout.  3) The voting system is geared towards older people - young people tend to be highly mobile, not settled and transient, all of which the voting system is biased against.
I'm sure this presidency has made some impact but ego and nihilism runs very deep in edgy young 20s.
Probably confused because Beto (also confused) tried to trap her in a corner about her plans for universal childcare and pre-K, asking her if taxes will go up. She responded flatly, "no."   Because they won't. Because that's not how the plan works. Beto screwed up trying to jump on the tax bandwagon.
Do she doesn‚Äôt.
I guess. But is it representative of different schools, income levels, parts of the country? I'm taking all this polling with a grain of salt.

 >I've been trying to counter this narrative as best I can by referring to them as the Teacher and the Preacher.  I love this.   People seem to think that it will be better if one drops out to consolidate the progressives but honestly I think it's better to have both in the running for a while, and especially in the debates where they can back each other up. Imagine if it was just Bernie vs. Amy/Pete/Joe/Beto/Booker. Or just Warren vs. that block. Instead they're able to support each other and consequently they seem more formidable (IMHO).
> ...by referring to them as the Teacher and the Preacher.   This is perfect! I‚Äôm going to start using this myself.   And while the idea of having them both on the same ticket is appealing, I feel like that will be wasting one if their talents as VP is usually a fairly ceremonial role. Currently I‚Äôm hoping for a Bernie Presidency and a Warren Senate Majority Leader as I feel like that would play to both their strengths.   I‚Äôd honestly be happy with either outcome though.
I think president and Majority Leader would be more effective in building a consensus for the Senate. That being said having the deciding vote may be important depending on how Senate elections turn out.
that's why I think for the next Presidency Warren would be best, leading into Bernie. My only concern is (and please don't take this as a Russian talking point to discredit Bernie **at all**) tht Bernie might not be in perfect health in (optimistically) 8 years - but I don't think America as a whole would respomn well to Bernie in 2020, and Warren could help transition your country well.   If you disagree with me, feel free to tell me why! This is my opinion as a non-American, but maybe there are some nuances I've missed.
Except many people in America do not want a preacher. That's a bad way to describe him.
The Democrats would never elect Bernie to be their Senate majority leader.
And every other candidate's sub. Except Buttigieg supporters being warm to Biden.
> bad actors from the right  its mostly Russians, seriously.
Bernie or bust wasn‚Äôt even a real thing, Bernie voters overwhelmingly supported Hillary in the general and the few that didn‚Äôt were mostly centrist/republican leaning independents who most likely would have not voted for any other democrat except Bernie.
Bernie bros also isn‚Äôt a self-proclaimed titled at all, it was pushed disingenuously in 2016 and now again in this election cycle to alienate people from supporting Bernie by framing his supporters as angry cis gender white men. It‚Äôs actually pretty misogynistic and insulting to the many women and POC who support him. That being said, Bernie and Warren are great.
I had a highly upvoted comment pretty similar to this in S4P, specifically arguing against propagating negativity against Warren. Then a mod removed all my posts in the thread because arguing against shitting on Warren apparently wasn't in "good faith." Bernie's reddit contingent is a weird mixture of progressive positivity and hardliner tribalism, and even though I still support Bernie the latter has really turned me away from all of the Sanders/"progressive" subs.
Possibly, though I will say this sub probably has the most level headed subscribers of all the candidate subs I've seen.
Not a divisive response *at all*.  Edit: why'd you delete your reply? https://imgur.com/a/tBOAs8Z
Sanders‚Äô Housing For All bill would personally affect me. It would be against my best interest to vote for Warren over Sanders.
What do you mean? At least for Senator Warren, she‚Äôs made it very clear that she‚Äôs a capitalist. Senator Sanders is less inclined to throw his support behind those founding principals. And I will say that this is as much a conversation of rhetoric as it is policy.   If you would like to point out my flaws in thinking I‚Äôd be more that happy to reflect and reassess.
I have a part time job and donate $5 a month. Everyone can pitch in a little something to make a big difference!
But Bernie and Warren's economic policies largely differ only in scale, no?  What undergraduate intro economics class would cover anything that would be relevant, much less something that would distinguish between these two candidates in particular?
[removed]
Who would they consider her over? I'm so confused.
Given that they'll inherit an environmental crisis that Trump is hastening astounds me. I know boomers get a lot of the blame with this group but they'll have no one to blame but themselves if they sit out this election.
oh, right. Her answer was the truth. She's paying for it with the wealth tax like she says almost every time it's brought up lol. That's not a "Taxes will go up" thing for 99% of people.
No* she doesn‚Äôt.   She‚Äôs for means tested policies. Her student debt cancelation caps at 50,000.   https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/politics/elizabeth-warren-medicare-for-all/index.html
Might be. Depends on the methodology. But 1,500 is a larger sample size than most polls.
Ok but *Newsweek* is only reporting on what *someone else* did:  > College Pulse, a data and survey analytics company, and Chegg, an education technology company, launched an "Election Tracker" in March. Since its launch, they've asked college students on a weekly basis to select the candidate they'd most like to see as the Democratic nominee for president.  *Newsweek* isn't conducting the poll.
I agree with this wholeheartedly. They both need to be in it at least until voting in order to prevent a moderate pile up.
Exactly, and the debates so far show that. Bernie and Liz have done excellently at pushing their message and not attacking each other while Biden and the other moderates either punch at each other or struggle to land a punch on Sanders or Warren.
Better yet, imagine a running even later on that looks like Bernie, Warren, Biden as the only realistic contenders as opposed to just Bernie vs Biden or Warren vs Biden. I agree completely that it makes sense for them to both stay in the running until quite a bit later.
Agreed.  That they're both polling to keep in the debates prevents either from looking like the "batshit crazy" candidate for having reasonable views that don't match the status quo.
I agree wholeheartedly. This isn't a 2016 GOP overcrowded shit show right now. Everyone curtently is working to move policy needles and I love it. Dropouts can happen after the voting starts.
I think Andrew Yang is going to surprise everyone
>I feel like that will be wasting one if their talents as VP is usually a fairly ceremonial role  That is totally a fair point. To be honest, a lot of my opinions are based on my underlying belief that a Sanders or Warren presidency will change the rules of the game and completely derail the conventional wisdom. I can see a VP Sanders joining union workers on strike or holding rallies in the states whose Senators are bottlenecking legislation. I can see a VP Warren as the tip-of-the-spear liaison in breaking up corporate monopolies. a VP can have immense power (e.g. Dick Cheney) if they know how to wield it intelligently and they are on the same page as the President. I can see how it could be more strategically useful to have a strong progressive leader in both branches of the government, though.
Majority leader or some kinda cabinet position, although I don't know what it would be.
I hear your concerns, and can't say you're mistaken. With Elijah Cummings recent death, it's impossible to avoid thinking about how much time our leaders have to get their good work done. They could be like Jimmy Carter, building houses well into their 90s, but there's also no reason to expect that to be the case.   I have kind of an unpopular perspective on this. I think the only health that matters is mental health. My favorite president was FDR, and he was half-paralyzed and died in office. He also won four terms and stewarded the country through one of the greatest crises America has ever faced. The first does not detract from the second. It is what it is. Imagine a world where Herbert Hoover was re-elected because we were worried about FDRs health. The depression gets worse, prohibition gets worse, and god only knows how WWII would have turned out.  Compare that to today, where we have a completely mentally unstable narcissist as president, and the guy currently considered to be in the lead on the democratic side is showing early signs of cognitive decline. We haven't even started primary voting yet, and Joe Biden is mentally where Ronald Reagan was at by the end of his second term. That is not a place we can afford to be at as a country. Yes, we can have concerns about Bernie's health. Yes, those concerns may even end up being justified. But if we make our decisions based on the fear of what could go wrong rather than on the America we want our children to inherit, we will continue to squander the opportunities that arise. I am tired of conceding to the shortsighted fears of the past. I want to build something new.
It's mostly just a pithy way of emphasizing the rock-steady moral leadership that I think is central to his appeal. See "if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves" and "Nobody in this room‚Ä¶ 30 years from now, wants to look your kid or your grandchild in the eye and have that child say to you, 'Grandpa you knew. You knew back in 2020, 2019, what the scientists were saying. You didn‚Äôt do anything and look what you created. Look at the world that you gave me.' That is not anything that I want anybody in this room or in this country to have to face."  The guy has one of the most well-developed moral compasses of anyone I've ever seen. That might not be an important factor for some folks, but I think it is worth emphasizing. He consistently chooses to advocate for what is right, even when it was unpopular to do so. For every mistake America has made over the past 30 years, there is a video of Bernie on the floor of congress trying to stop us from making it. I think that's important to point out
Oh, I know. Case in point, me.  I'm saying that they're trying to sow division anyway they can the same way they did in 2016 with things like Bernie or bust.
Yes, people forget the Clinton campaign tried to do the same to Obama in '08. "Obama Boys" was a term they generated which gained less traction than Bernie Bro.
Case in point that the Bernie camp likes to yell that smears are never acceptable while using their own in the same sentence against anyone who would criticize them.  Try following your own words and stop attacking Democrats yourself.
That's very true. I more so meant those who used the term to describe themselves were nothing more than bad faith actors on the right.
I'm subbed here and S4P. I admit there is a weird Bernie contingent that doesn't see the benefit of multiple candidates running progressive campaigns. On behalf of good faith Sanders supporters, I'm sorry. Not everyone is like that. For what it's worth, I can't stand the nut-jobs on /r/wayofthebern. Pretty sure that's a troll farm and I say that as a Sanders supporter.
Warren has now overtaken Biden on the PredictIt market for the Democratic nomination
These things naturally fluctuate but at posting time the numbers are:  Warren 28%  Biden 27%  Sanders 14%  Harris 14%  Yang 9%  Buttigieg 9%  Gabbard 5%  Booker 3%
That site also has Hillary at 4 so let‚Äôs not get too excited.
It will be hilarious and sad if opponents dogpile her for all her pesky "plans," when she has a plan for that too.
I've traded on a similar prediction betting site - the University of Iowa's [IEM market](https://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/markets/pres16.html) \- for a little over a decade now. In 2008, I bet on a nomination long-shot named Barack Obama and wound up making a $500 profit on my bet. (I literally got an "Obama check!")  Anyway, it bears mentioning here that on November 7th 2016, the day before the infamous election, the prediction markets had contracts for a Trump win trading at 20¬¢ - basically, a 20% chance. Just goes to show, The Crowds don't always know all.  (In b4 others point this out - yes, I know this doesn't really mean that "the polls were wrong." It just means that the crowds, like everyone, rated his chances at around 20%. And occasionally, things that happen 1 out of 5 times DO actually happen! The percentages were right. Trump's election was really just a long-shot that worked out.)
WHO THE HELL LIKES BIDEN  &#x200B;  That man is the definition of walking clusterfuck.
Plus, she tied Biden in the Adel, Iowa Sweet Corn Festival corn kernal poll, so yeah. We got this.
These markets tend to reflect the participants' wishful thinking more than privileged knowledge. I wouldn't read too much into this. Go Warren, though!
Would I win more money betting against Biden or betting for Warren?
This is great news!  And for all the OP contributors. Please know that I am very grateful for all the hard work you put into this Sub.
Good, let's keep at it.
I'd buy Biden at those prices. He's far from a shoe-in but it's absurd to suggest he's not, by far, the strongest candidate in terms of polling. As the less-engaged moderates tune in, his numbers will only increase.  To be clear, though, I'd much much much rather Warren!
Aren't these betters non-Americans?
I wonder if these numbers become meaningful at some point in either the near or distant elections when bettors start voting to win their wagers.    Pundits will start analyzing the Pete Rose effect at the polls.
Love the news, hate anything that promotes gambling.
woot thanks scottish teens!
Help out a non American here. Why the hell isn't Bernie in the lead??
Biden is the fastest way to lose my vote in this election.
Big news for sure but remember this isn‚Äôt the polling necessarily. Betting involves mostly predictions and sometimes dark horse candidates. That‚Äôs why Yang is at 9 percent when he‚Äôs not polling higher than 4 percent and more like 2 percent or why Gabbard is above Booker.   Still, thanks for sharing!
I am very heavily invested in Warren.  Got in weeks ago.  13 cents that she wins the presidency as well.
I‚Äôm doubting this prediction because of how high they put yang. Putting yang on par with butti is just ridiculous.   This prediction thing has always been insane. This could be a good sign, but i‚Äôd take it with a grain of salt.
Must be fast fluctuations, they‚Äôre tied now
So does this mean there's a 28% "chance" she receives the nomination
There's been enough behind-the-scenes gossip that it's not *inconceivable* she could jump in if Biden crashes out or things go sideways at a brokered convention. Still overwhelmingly unlikely, but 4% chance it happens does mean 96% chance it doesn't.
Yeah these numbers are pretty whack
Right, it probably boils down to "okay, so what, **concretely**, will you do to solve [problem]?"
I remember watching that site on the night of the 2004 election... that thing went crazy after the exit polls came out, and again after the returns started coming in.
As far as I can tell, a little bit of everyone. Biden has the nice bump of being a former VP for an extremely popular president.   Keep in mind that for all the policy questions in this most people still just want someone that they feel sure will beat Trump. Biden has that self-fulfilling prophecy at his back - he's electable because he polls well, and he polls well because he's electable.   Warren has a clear path forward to be the nominee despite that, but a lot of people backing Biden are looking for a sure thing. Nothing wrong with that, let's just show them Warren is a safe bet too.
People that don‚Äôt use the internet.
Boomers and Gen x
My opinion is that name recognition amongst the politically uninformed is what is driving his high polling numbers. We're talking about people who literally don't even know that there are other candidates running except for Biden, and maybe Bernie, and I'm being serious.  I sincerely believe that there is a statistically significant number of people out there who believe Biden is running against Trump in 2020, and that's all they know. They believe Biden is the best bet because he's the only person whose name they instantly recognize. They're uninformed.   I was politically disconnected until this year. I honestly believed that there were only two candidates running for the democratic nomination in 2016, and they they were Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. I had no idea that there were more than a dozen.
In a race that includes Williamson and Yang, Biden is far from the worst candidate. He's also far from the best, but not bottom of the barrel.
An 80 year old retired first sergeant that claims Biden should be the only one running and get the nomination. Thats who and please no ageism. Ive never seen that much hate for Dems out of an elder Dem.

Assuming a favorable outcome, you would win more money betting YES for either candidate, and less money for betting NO.  The cost of 1 YES share is ~$0.28. The cost of 1 NO share is ~$0.73. You can buy as many shares as you'd like, until you reach $850 invested(at which point they cut you off).   You can only invest a maximum of $850. Since YES shares are cheaper than NO shares, you'd can buy more of them before reaching the $850 cap. When the market settles, you will be awarded $1.00 for each share you own, if your candidate wins.
I really disagree. I think he has nowhere to go but down. The polling doesn't only poll people who are currently engaged. Being the default candidate, he's the go-to choice for people who don't pay attention.  As more people get involved, his support will drop. As more people hear him speak, his support will drop. He has no room to grow. As his support drops,  his facade of electability will crack. Polling is mostly useful for trend lines at this stage, and his has *not* been good.
Yes, this isn't geo-restricted.
Sanders did decently against Clinton in 2016 (and still lost) partially because he was the only real alternative -- plenty of his voters were more anti-Clinton than pro-Sanders. Lots more options now. Like Biden, there are age concerns. Also, while he does have a hardcore base of support, he also has a lot of folks who would *never* support him due to age, ideology, anti-establishment rhetoric, etc. High floor/low ceiling is fine in a fractured field, and he has been polling in the top tier. But it implies limited room for growth as the field winnows, especially since he already has near-universal name recognition (plus his numbers have actually backslid recently).  I say all this as somebody who voted for Sanders in '16 and would probably do so again if it weren't for Warren.
He‚Äôs third in the polls right now(behind Warren and Biden), and more importantly, doesn‚Äôt have a huge amount of room to grow. His base is primarily younger white voters, which is a large base, but he struggles a bit with nonwhite and older voters(whereas Warren does well with older, college educated voters, and Biden does well with older and nonwhite voters.)

They cherry pick polls. Fake news. But I do believe Warren is rising. Warren and Bernie will beat Joe.
Do you prefer Trump?
I wouldn't be surprised if there's also a significant overlap between people who support Yang or Gabbard and people who trade shares on online prediction markets. There's probably a number of them overly-optimistic about the candidate they support, and making their trading decisions based on that.
9% is too high, but honestly, I do feel like Yang and Gabbard both have a clearer path than candidates that poll a bit better, like Booker, Beto, or Klobuchar. I think if we went to war with Iran, Gabbard's stock would rise, and I could conceive of a scenario where Yang is able to get his message out in a smaller debate and his campaign starts to get some legs. He's got a weird cocktail of support from some progressives mixed with a lot of libertarians.  Booker has some supporters, but he doesn't really offer anything the other candidates aren't. I just don't see him taking over Liz or Bernie on the left, Biden or Buttigieg on the right, or even Harris by his side where he's at.
Going into this primary the two candidates I wanted to see and hear from were Warren and Harris.  And, this far through two debates, I still think that they're the two best candidates... In fact, I'd be extremely happy if the 2020 Democrat ticket will be Warren/Harris (or Harris/Warren).  I don't know how realistic this is, but to me all the other candidates are a somewhat distant second tier candidates... Sorry Bernie dudes and dudettes... And not sorry Joe dudes and dudettes.
The prediction market is a good parallel metric to polls, which also don‚Äôt hold much water this far out. It takes into account various scenarios that people can imagine playing out, so captures an element of mindset and intuition and other intangibles outside the polls. Which is worth keeping an eye on in the age of trump. Pete is certainly polling far above Yang, and neither has a strong path to the nomination, but it‚Äôs easier for me to imagine Yang turning it around and catching fire than Pete.
Nah it‚Äôs a lot more complicated than that
More or less. It‚Äôs not that accurate, and the numbers will add up to more than 100, but it‚Äôs basically the price as a %.
Way more complicated than that, and extremely unlikely to be representative of the final outcome, especially this early.   Why? Lot's of reasons. PredictIt is basically a game, and there are different types of people, each playing the game differently.    There are investors who disregard personal political affiliations. They use data and experience to make informed decisions based on the market. They will invest YES or NO on any, or all, of the candidates depending on whether they think that candidate is currently undervalued or overvalued. They simply want to buy low and sell high. They're constantly looking for opportunities.   There are also "voters". These people will pick one or two candidates to invest in and just wait for the market to close. They just want to buy as many shares as possible for their choice, and then wait for the market to close, rather than sell to other traders, to maximize their ROI. These people typically have a high risk tolerance, and/or a very strong belief that one particular candidate may win. Their choice(s) may or may not necessarily be their own personal preference, however.    There are predators/surge traders/pump and dumpers. This is typically a person or group of people who prey on the optimism of others. They prey on newbies in various ways. Typically they introduce them to a market, generate hype around it, wait for the price to inflate, and then they sell all of their cheaply purchased shares for a massive profit. This is one reason I would advise **against** investing when hype is high, unless you can convince yourself to objectively believe that the shares are undervalued.   This post could be considered an example of what a nefarious pump and dump group would use to exploit the optimism of their victims. I'm not saying that it is, just saying that it could be.   For these reasons, and many others, do not look to PredictIt as an accurate representation of where each candidate stands to win the nomination. You may consider using PredictIt as investment opportunity for your favorite candidate, but always trust your intuition, consider your risk tolerance, and invest objectively.   If you're new, I will advise that you should invest, not on your desire, but rather, your informed opinion, that a candidate will win.
Wait, what on earth? Elaborate please
Everyone else: [Pretty words]  Warren: [Concrete actions]
See, but what I don't get from their perspective is that Hillary was also a "sure thing." Is Biden seriously not considered in the mainstream as bad of a candidate as Clinton?
Gen Xer here. Not as many of us are Biden fans as you might think.
OP asked how they would win more money, not which bet would be more likely to win. The weaker probability means larger payout, so betting on Warren would pay better.
I also think that right now, Warren, Sanders, and a few other candidates are splitting the progressive vote. As each one drops out, their supporters will flock to whoever's left, driving up their numbers.
Progressive =\= ‚Äúleftist‚Äù (I am not suggesting Bernie is far left but those that are tend to support him). Progressives certainly support warren.
Please don't bring this polling is rigged and fake news nonsense into this sub
Nope. But I think it's more beneficial to society to let Trump run around with a flame thrower destroying everything then it is to elect Biden.   Not that it matters...I think Trump will win either way. No matter how many votes he loses by.
I don't know about Gabbard -- as soon as her connections to Bannon and Assad start getting air time, she's going down like a lead balloon. (At least, I hope...)
I completely agree with everything you said. I‚Äôm actually a Yang supporter but Warren is my first choice out of the big candidates so it‚Äôs always great to see her do well. Both are smart and policy driven and seem like nice people. I‚Äôm just being realistic about polls as they currently are
Exactly, Beto and Booker already have candidates who, to put it crudely, do their thing better (young woke white guy and black moderate) and suck up the oxygen from their campaigns. Yang has a unique selling point.
I like Yang but there's no excuse for putting him above Buttigieg. In terms of likeliest to win the nomination, the only ones who are not extreme long shots are Biden, Liz, Bernie, Harris, and Pete. Yang's only path is everyone waking up one day and thinking UBI is the best thing since sliced bread.
While anything is possible, I really think this is a four dog race.  Biden is at the top.  Then Warren.  With Bernie and Harris with an outside chance.
I just disagree. This is for gambling so it accounts for ‚Äúcrazy turnarounds!‚Äù and more.   Celebrating a prediction market is bad. This means nothing. Polls mean little at this stage, but are still worth millions over a prediction market.
I don't buy into it, but some traders are reading into tea leaves like Clinton allies networking more on Twitter, her giving speeches that sound vaguely stump-like, Biden's recent wobbliness, etc. Plus the fact that filing deadlines to run don't start passing until October. You can read more speculation in the comments for [the dedicated market for whether she'll run](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/4614/Will-Hillary-Clinton-run-for-president-in-2020), which is even higher on those odds (currently 9%) than the larger Dem nomination one.
Honestly, I don't know. By any objective standard, Hillary was one of, if not the most qualified person to ever run for president. (Experience-wise, not necessarily policy.) Former first lady, Senator, and secretary of state is a mind-boggling resume.   So when you have someone like that lose to a reality show host made up of 75 percent Big Mac grease, suddenly you realize that objective measures don't matter and it's all about people's feelings about a candidate. I mean, that was kinda how things have been all along to some extent, but I feel like we've never been in such a post-fact world like now.   Remember to that Hillary was very popular in general (despite the Benghazi sideshow and her being a right wing boogeyman) right up until she decided to run for president. The media got whipped into a frenzy over her. I don't see that happening to Biden since there's tons more to distract the media from trashing him (in 2016 the only Democrat competing for media attention was Bernie, and he didn't get a ton of mainstream notice.)  All that to say that maybe the fuzzy feelings people get from Biden being associated with Obama might be what matters most when it comes to election day. It's stupid, I know, but the media doesn't teach people to demand things of substance much.   To her credit Warren really balances the "I have a plan and here are 50 pages of details" that wonks love with the "here's what I believe in, and don't worry, I'll sweat the details for you" that resonates the most with the general public. Maybe that'll be enough when Biden's Nice Old Man shtick runs dry.
Hillary had a 33% chance to lose, Biden's chance of losing is around 40-45%
[deleted]
That's just an objective fact that polls are cherry picked and skewed.
Accelerationism is an insane strategy. The Supreme Court exists and the planet‚Äôs in crisis. For all his faults, Biden is still leagues better than Trump on these crucial issues.
You are insane
[...Really?](https://giphy.com/gifs/2020-town-hall-elizabeth-warren-IhJDDm4C9h5oVNWqA1/fullscreen)
Maybe. Obviously, I think Warren is the best, but strictly in terms of who has a path to the Presidency, I don't see a Gillibrand, Klobuchar, or even a Booker path. I can see a Gabbard path, and it goes through Iran. If everything is focused on foreign policy instead of domestic policy, I can see a scenario where the conversation switches from Warren/Sanders vs. Biden to Gabbard vs. Buttigieg -- or both debates happening side by side.
I like Yang in a lot of regards. I met him, and he signed a copy of his book for me, which was cool. I respect like hell that he puts his policies out there for anyone to read. What put me over into the Warren camp was the way he structured the Freedom dividend. I'm interested in the idea of UBI, but I get nervous with it replacing the social safety net and being funded by a VAT. The same thing that excites libertarians is what makes me nervous. But that's really in the weeds. Overall, he has a good platform, and I'm a bit disappointed he hasn't had much of an opportunity to talk because I think he has something to add to the conversation.
But it‚Äôs a selling point people aren‚Äôt really buying. If Biden blows it, that opens up a lot of support for people like Beto and Booker (plus Booker if Harris blows it). Yang is what he is, which is a single issue candidate that people don‚Äôt have anything against but isn‚Äôt someone the masses are likely to turn to.
Wait who's the other black moderate? Harris spent most of her time in the Senate on a very leftward path.  I'd say Booker's gimmick is that love wins but Marianne Williamson does that better than him.
The thing about prediction markets is that they‚Äôre less efficient at valuing low-probability options like Yang - the relatively high fees of predictit mean betting on Yang not winning the nomination is going to give you about an 8% return over the course of a year, whereas betting on him to win would give you a 900% return. Betting against low-probability options is inefficient enough to distort prices that would normally be in the low-to-mid single digits up to the high single digits.
I think Harris is on a downward trend, and Pete is just kind of stagnant. He has a pretty exclusively white crowd too. Yang's presence is growing and I suspect it'll start growing a little more exponentially as the primary cycle goes on. And it won't be very precedented.
I agreed that 9% was too high. Pete definitely has more of a chance. I'd say Gabbard probably has more of a chance too, but I'd put them both above all the candidates other than the ones you mentioned.
I'm afraid that you might be right.  That's why I said that I don't know how realistic a Warren/Harris ticket is.  One of the biggest reasons for me not wanting Biden is that he still thinks that he can work with Republicans.  You'd think he learned from eight years of having a front row seat watching Obama getting his hand slapped back every time he reached across the aisle by McConnell, wouldn't you?  Biden's time has passed.  And as far as Bernie, I think that Warren is a better version of him.  But I'd be okay with him winning the nomination as a consolation price.  However, there's still a long time until the Democrats hold their primaries so I'll hold out hope that at least Warren will overtake Biden.  And, as a left-leaning Independent, I'm gonna do my best to help out Warren and Harris as much as I can.
Celebrating anything a full year before the convention and 6 months before the first vote is bad. The only value in such things for activists and volunteers is to help keep our fingers on the pulse of the community to help us focus our efforts. If the prediction markers show a sudden surge for Inslee or Gabbard or de Blasio, I think it‚Äôs worth asking why.
Hmm, very good points. And he is kind of the media sweetheart on the liberal side. Sadly.   I expect more from the left, but maybe that's just wishful thinking.
It's really not an objective fact, it's actually the opposite.
>Accelerationism is an insane strategy.  mainly because *literally the opposite of what it posits* happens every single time
I disagree.
This will definitely convince me to vote with you rather than against you.
My point is that Gabbard is flying under the radar right now, but if she ever rises to prominence her baggage will be under the glare of the media spotlight and it'll sink her campaign.   Almost every single Democratic candidate is anti-war. Only one is an associate of Steve Bannon and supports Murderous Dictator Bashar Assad.
I believe Buttigieg‚Äôs favorability with voters of color is fine, he is just still pretty unknown. He would take voters from Biden and Warren, I think, if they start to drop. My guess is his plan is to let the top candidates go attack each other and eventually emerge as a consensus candidate if voters get sick of them.
My major issue with Biden is that he‚Äôs clearly slipping.  The guy is 76 so that makes sense, but having seen him in action recently, he just isn‚Äôt 100%.
Actually it is, go check out RCP's cherry picking
The fact that Biden is the current frontrunner in and of itself debunks accelerationism as an effective strategy.
You are either a child, a lair/troll, a closet trump supporter, or just plain crazy.     I‚Äôm not trying to convince you of anything
If she can't answer to those allegations, you are probably correct.
It's sad to say but in today's world, I really don't think those allegations will hurt her campaign if she rises to prominence.      The reason I would give her a better road to the nomination than anyone polling outside of the top five is because A. She's had some good moments in the debates and B. She's the type of Democrat I could see New Hampshire voters 'defaulting' to voting for and she has a very strong ground game here in NH.
From conversations I‚Äôve had the way that he mishandled the police shooting in South Bend tanked what little trust/credibility with POC he‚Äôd had a chance to build up, and I really think he‚Äôll have a hard time getting it back.
How much support did he have with POC before that?
It is a weak spot, but they don‚Äôt hate him or anything. Of black Dems who have heard of him, about 12% are ‚Äúvery uncomfortable‚Äù with him compared to about 9% for Warren.   The only candidates actually doing well with black voters are Biden and Bernie.  https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016b-42e1-d5f3-a1ef-c7e3eaa50000
Little to none, as he does now.
Please do NOT go to online Pete supporter communities and convince them to support Warren.
I had already decided to support Warren when Pete dropped out, but the sheer decency of this post makes me so happy I did.  I'm still processing it but I'm so glad Warren is still in the race, it makes it a little easier.
Agreed. When supporters come here be welcoming, but don't go into their spaces and try to drag them over. Not the time or the place.
And similarly, don't reply to Pete supporters in a general politics forum like r/politics pushing Warren unless they specifically say they're trying to decide on a new candidate. Give them space to grieve. They'll let us know when they're ready to pick a second choice.
Agree, having experienced that on the other end, I know how annoying that can be.  People deserve to process their emotion whichever way they need to.
I supported both equally so now I‚Äôm throwing my full weight into backing Warren!
I appreciate the civility. I was a Pete supporter, but I have decided Warren will have my vote if she is still in when we get to my state (I‚Äôm long after Tuesday.) I admire how intelligent, articulate, and progressive she is.
Totally agree, that‚Äôs a shitty move. Certain group of toxic supporters do it to us all the time and it‚Äôs a real turn off.  Be empathetic and answer questions as needed, after all we want pretty much the same things.
The only advice I would give them is to stay off of r/politics for a while. It's absolutely toxic over there. Any slight critique of one particular candidate will get you sent to the gallows.
Many of us are already here! I‚Äôve been subbed to both communities on reddit for a while now.
Frankly I feel very bad for the people who already mailed in their ballots. If I were them I would have liked a chance to vote for my second choice.
I'm mainly seeing that from the berners...but if u are doing that pls stop.
Agree with this. And it must have been a complete shock because no one saw this coming, especially two days before ST. I was shocked when I read about it.
Gotta love the difference between these voters and what you see in Bernie subs.  "Delete all the toxic shit you've tweeted then reach out! Make sure all the rat emojis are gone!" Seriously, it's like two people with the same goals. One pursues it with compassion, the other with anger. Where have I seen that dichotomy before?
They are too busy being harassed by Bernie bros to hear you anyway.
I just wanna say, this is truly a good political community on reddit, and that's a hard thing to build, and it's a testament to the candidate, the supporters and the mods here.  Keep doing exactly what you're doing.
[deleted]
Pete was my first choice, but Warren is my second precisely because her candidacy fosters a community response like this.    Warren builds bridges and has realistic ideas about how to achieve progressive/liberal policy goals.  Unlike a certain campaign staffed with  Jill Stein voters, who focus on tearing down every other candidate to get ahead.
Love to get this or a post like this on the top.
THEY will come to US. If they were gonna support Bernie they'd support him already.
As a Pete supporter, it's the worst response. Just wait and have confidence that we will end up where we truly need to be. ;)
It speaks volumes that you're giving us time to figure out a path forward while our sub is brigaded by Bernie supporters both trolling and trying to get our vote.  Thank you all, so very much for your considerate thoughts and actions.  -edited to comply with subreddit rules-
Amen- we certainly can't complain about other candidates' supporters being too aggressive, if we're guilty of similar behavior.
Pete supporter, this shows class, as opposed to bernie bros posing for pete fans on Twitter without bothering to change their RTs pics...
As a Pete supporter this is what makes you're campaign and community supremely different. Many of us will find our way here. I think I've received 30 different hate messages from Bros who then told me I HAD to vote for their guy. I'll probably end up voting for Joe but I vote after super Tuesday. If Warren has a shot by the time I vote then I'm all in. I really admire her hopeful candidacy. She's a wonderful leader.
Thank you guys for having some morals. A high-profile Bernie supporter just doxxed Pete‚Äôs personal phone number and Bernie Bros are flooding Twitter bragging about sending him rat memes and death threats. If Buttigieg endorses a nominee, I will follow them, but if he doesn‚Äôt, and Warren calls out Bernie HARD for his rape essays, for this doxxing, for being a Marxist-Leninist, for dirtily erasing the first LGBTQ primary victory from a gay man, I will switch to Warren. And that‚Äôs the ONLY condition. Warren, if you‚Äôre reading this, come get my vote.
It really sucks.  Pete's likely the only one to survive the Covid-19 virus as he's not in the vulnerable demographic.  Seriously though, what happens if all the potential front runners (Bernie, Biden, Bloomberg) all suddenly get sick and incapacitated?
This is super important, Warren has always been my second favorite and this sub has made me feel welcomed instead of pushed away *cough* Bernie subs *cough*
Pete supporter will be voting for Warren tomorrow in Massachusetts
To all Pete supporters that are considering Elizabeth Warren: Welcome!  Pete has great ideas, and I hope he continues his political career in some form.  If you're here looking into Warren (or have already decided to move to Warren), we're glad to have you!  This is a great community. :)
Well said. Pete is a landmark candidate, and his run was personally meaningful for many of his supporters. They‚Äôre grieving the loss of something that was deeply important to them, possibly more than the backers of other candidates who have dropped out.   The good news is, I have no doubt we‚Äôll see him again. He‚Äôs going to do great things, and he‚Äôs so young that he‚Äôs got plenty of time to do them. He‚Äôs inspiring and promising.   If you‚Äôre a Pete supporter and you‚Äôre reading this, know that you have my sympathy, and your candidate has my support for the next try, whether that‚Äôs running for a different office, running for President again in 4-8 years, or doing something else entirely. He made history this year. He put a big crack in the glass ceiling that exists for LGBT people just as it does for women, and he deserves great admiration for that.
As a Floridian, the race narrows significantly before I get to vote.  Warren was always my first pick, and I jumped over to Pete when it looked as if he‚Äôd be the front-runner in the ‚Äúpragmatic progressive‚Äù lane.  I‚Äôll be more than happy to vote Warren if she has a good showing on Super Tuesday, but my gut is telling me the best shot to keep Bernie out might end up being Biden.  (Again, I‚Äôm talking about when it gets to be my turn to vote in Florida.)  I‚Äôm not really thrilled about that prospect, because his debate performances were, *ahem*, yeah, you know what I mean.
Meanwhile on the Sanders sub, they released a playbook on how to poach disappointed Pete supporters. Gross manipulation strait out of those pick up artists tips. Enough to suggest replacing their rat emojis with bees to hide evidence that they've been shitting on Pete for months by pretending to be supportive.
As with all things, compassion and empathy are key.  I certainly hope this doesn't happen, but it's entirely possible that in the next two weeks we'll all go through the same experience that Mayor Pete's supporters are coping with. And while I personally am pretty thick-skinned, I realize how heartbreaking that can be for others. And even I would consider it be in pretty bad taste if Warren were to end her campaign, and the next day the Bernie and Biden crowds got in our faces asking for our support.
I HAVE done this with some close friends who follow politics, but in private communication and with the recognition that it's probably too soon to for me to pitch Warren.  I aggree that it's a slimy move to lay on a thick sales pitch on fans of Pete so soon after he droped out.

Warren supporters would just be drowned out by Bernie camp flooding his subreddit and all of a sudden liking Pete.
Was never worried about you guys doing this to us! Love y'all.
Absolutely disagree with this... you are crossing emotion with strategy. Sorry if this comes off harsh, but it‚Äôs not like someone died. Time and votes are valuable. If we don‚Äôt talk to those supporters now someone else will swoop and and do it first for their candidate.   Every vote counts and this is not the time to soften just because someone dropped out.
...it's not like it's a death in the family.   Pete was my #1. I'm proud of his campaign and his decision to drop out when he did. On to the next one. The important things is beating Trump.
**Hard disagree: If not now when.**  -  Nows not the time to let up. Nows the time to double down. Super Tuesday is in 1 day. There will be no second chances. There won't be any more time to convince them. They will vote tomorrow.
Yup, the culture of the Warren Camp in general is very reminiscent of the Buttigieg ROTR.  As a guy who was torn between the two (admittedly leaning more towards Pete until today) it‚Äôs posts like this that make me glad to have donated to both campaigns and have a clear place to get behind my new #1 candidate!   Go Liz!!
We are very glad to have you, you are welcome here anytime
Same.
My mother was listening to Pete's farewell speech on WaPo, and I stood at the door and listened in. Brought a few tears to my eyes. Pete's a good man, who understands that what unites so many of us as Americans is a better world for all of us.
I never supported Pete on a policy level. But I'll admit, I'm sad to see him drop out. I knew homophobia in this country was too harsh to elect a gay president, but it meant so much to see a gay man giving it a go and receiving so much support. It's something, it just stung to see him drop out.  Thanks for your support of Warren. Let's make this a place where a guy like Pete can run and is judged only for his policies.
Even if I haven't felt the same about their policies, I've always been very impressed by Pete supporters attitude, and I feel that Warren and Pete supporters have a very similar attitude.
exactly. we ask that other campaigns respect our space to support warren, we should do the same and respect their space to support each other & process this.
Agreed. People who commit to a candidate are for the most part pretty well informed, and they have their reasons for choosing that candidate. We need to respect that. As awesome as Elizabeth is, they chose Pete because he is a better fit for their priorities.   Now that he‚Äôs stepped back they have a decision to make. But it‚Äôs pretty condescending to go ‚Äúrecruit‚Äù them as though the only reason they support candidate A is because they didn‚Äôt know enough about B. Most of them already know who their second choice is - just as we Warrenites all know who we would support if Liz called it quits. Some may be torn. But those who want to join us know where to find us.
I'm amazing many lasted so long in r/politics.... I had to stop visiting when it got too brutal for our guy. Anyway, Iowa Pete caucuser and also Warren donor/admirer, checking in!
Woo!!!
Yay! We'll be glad to have you!
>certain groups       Those certain groups are even worse in r/politics. It feels like warrens ideas are pretty consistently under attack from brothers of a certain ilk. It‚Äôs nice to come here and not have to defend my positions, although those people still sneak in occasionally.
Ugh. I really liked the discussions on there till around 6 months ago. Now it‚Äôs just a place of downvotes and intolerance.
There are multiple posts of the same stories from different media, all hogging the front page of /r/politics. All have thousands and thousands of votes.
It‚Äôs honestly Reddit‚Äôs own little Twitter sphere in all its toxic glory.
Yeah what the hell happened to that sub? Am I out of the loop? I remember it being more palatable four years ago
Do y‚Äôall remember the period before the debates started? I could go and spend time in the Warren sub, the Pete sub, the Kamala sub, and even politics and have interesting conversations and frank discussions about the strengths and weaknesses of different candidates, express my agreements and disagreements with certain positions of theirs etc. Even the Sanders supporters were fine to deal with, if a little insular within their own network of communities. We were all trying to find our way forward in good faith to the right person to take on Trump. It was even kinda fun.  But then the debates started and the ‚Äòsport‚Äô of politics kicked in and everything went to shit and suddenly Kamala‚Äôs a cop, Pete‚Äôs a racist, Liz is a snake, the ‚Äòestablishment‚Äô is screwing Bernie... etc. And the sad part is it‚Äôs not just the interference of bad faith actors like bots or trump supporters - the media diet that people consume has lead them to genuinely believe these things, and there are cult leaders of various podcasts/YouTube channels that get paid to burn down democratic unity as much as possible.   I supported Pete because I believed he could convince people away from that cliff and because he supported an innovative democratic reform package to make it stick. I‚Äôm now hoping for a Super Tuesday miracle for Liz, but failing that, I don‚Äôt see a path forward out of that quagmire and it‚Äôs pretty depressing.
OOh, stealthy. I like it!
Yeah, that sux.
I dropped my ballot off the same day I received it.  I'm feeling pretty devastated that my vote no longer counts.
That‚Äôs not surprising. They did that in the Harris sub the second she dropped out.
Some Bernie supporters got into our volunteer group chat and leaked our texts. Make sure you guys are safe!  http://imgur.com/gallery/HUTl76S
[deleted]
My Sanders supporting friend texted me to say he's sorry to hear Pete dropped out. Then he followed it up by asking if I'll be supporting Sanders in my state's primary. Lol. No.
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been on the receiving end of that kind of behaviour. It‚Äôs unacceptable, and we make sure that sort of stuff doesn‚Äôt fly here. You should be allowed time to grieve for the candidate you were all in for without people trying to get you to switch before you‚Äôre ready. That‚Äôs so incredibly disrespectful.
That is so rude of them!
Sry, y'all need some grieving time.  Pete ran a great campaign.
I'm sorry :/   we get that a lot here too, it sucks
This dude is a complete troll lmao I remember your username from Pete‚Äôs sub, Mr. ‚Äúvoting for trump if Bernie wins‚Äù
> A high-profile Bernie supporter just doxxed Pete‚Äôs personal phone number and Bernie Bros are flooding Twitter bragging about sending him rat memes and death threats  What in the actual fuck?! I'm surprised that I can still be shocked by their disgusting behavior, yet they continue to sink to new lows.   That's been a big critique of mine, even though I'm all in for Warren: go after how toxic Sanders and his supporters are *much* more forcefully. Why even be in this party if this is how the behave?
>A high-profile Bernie supporter just doxxed Pete‚Äôs personal phone number and Bernie Bros are flooding Twitter bragging about sending him rat memes and death threats.   This is just so messed up. I know every campaign has bad acting supporters, but just wow.
Jesus, they were calling for him to drop since he won Iowa...are they mad he dropped or just being gloating assholes?
Oh my god - who was the supporter?  Edit:nvm, just read it below. So horrible.
This. I'm a Pete supporter, but this is the only way Warren can win my vote. She needs to go really hard after Bernie - like NOW. I'm surprised she hasn't already. At the moment, I think it's basically between Biden and Bernie, but she could get my vote if she does this.
Source please?
This is something the campaigns need to talk about ASAP. As much as I love Warren's selfie lines, I think she really needs to stop for her own safety.
Thank you so much! :) we cannot let Bernie humiliate her out of the race ;)
Keeping warren above viability keeps more delegates out of Sanders hands
Source? I‚Äôm interested
One of the biggest complaints we got during our state of the subreddit thread was people coming here and starting their comment with "I'm a <candidate> supporter yada yada yada". Please don't do that to other folks.
Removed, rule four.
Removed, rule 11. No promoting other candidates.
We will come to you to ask those questions. The Pete sub is a close knit community and frustrating for it to be suddenly filled with spam when trying to grieve with the people who have been part of it for the last year. I‚Äôve been very grateful so far to not see spam from Warren supporters unlike some other candidates.
LOL Is this supposed to be a rallying cry?  TokenHalfBlack is an admitted Bernie supporter. You‚Äôve said as much in this sub, so not telling anything out of school.  On its face, this is some fail advice for Warren supporters. But add to that, the motivation which is to undermine Warren, and it becomes extra sad and absurd how petty and awkward they get trying to influence the conversation here.
Thanks but nah. I'll tell you the same thing I politely tell empathy-challenged Bernie supporters who get in my face about being a Warren voter: informed people don't like being told who they \*have\* to vote for.   And along the same lines of being empathy-challenged, people whose candidate just dropped out don't necessarily want you or me sniffing around their door while the ink is still drying on the press release.  But hey, if you wanna be obnoxious about it go right ahead, just understand that you aren't helping your candidate.
Welcome, fellow Oregonian!
Pete was the closest candidate to Warren both in policy and voterbase wise.
Welcome, friend!  Glad to have you in the fight.
I was banned from there for saying I hope trump dies in prison. It was for the best, really.
I just yelled at a couple in the Pete megathread over there for *still* being assholes about him. Like he‚Äôs not even a threat to your guy anymore. Why? Why are y‚Äôall like this?
>  It‚Äôs nice to come here and not have to defend my positions  I hear what you‚Äôre saying. We need to take care of ourselves and support each other. At the same time, I appreciate people who are willing to share their thinking about candidates. I‚Äôm okay with it being different from mine.  What‚Äôs bad is when people aren‚Äôt respectful of differences of opinion.   Warren would be the best president imo:  - Not only is she great on *what* to do policy-wise, but also on *how* to get it done (e.g., get rid of filibuster). - She‚Äôs a skilled debater‚ÄîI see her being able to persuade centrists to support a progressive policy agenda.  - She‚Äôs the best candidate on race issues imo. I appreciate her thoughtful listening and how she incorporates what she‚Äôs learned into her discussion of other policy issues; she doesn‚Äôt relegate attention to race to explicit questions about race or criminal justice. For example, I loved her early speech on redlining in housing.  Despite all this, I‚Äôm probably going to vote for a different candidate by the time my primary happens (4/28).  I want my voice to be heard regardless of which candidate gets my vote, so I‚Äôve recently joined subs of 2 other candidates and have respectfully shared my views. I don‚Äôt see this as inappropriate or me ‚Äúsneaking in.‚Äù Hopefully that‚Äôs not how I‚Äôm viewed here.  It honestly didn‚Äôt occur to me that it might not be okay to post in a candidate‚Äôs sub if I wasn‚Äôt a committed supporter or if I had questions.  I think we need to learn to talk to each other.   Some harsh comments and dms have come my way, but also some nice ones.  I‚Äôm trying to take care not to judge any candidate by their most off-putting supporters. I remind myself that I know very little about any single commenter and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in their life that may influence them to act the way they do.  I‚Äôve also found that r/fivethirtyeight and r/friendsofthepod are good places to find cooler heads for discussion. r/VoteBlue is also a really nice sub (it‚Äôs about down-ticket races).  Heads up re harsh Sanders supporters: There are several Sanders subs. r/SandersForPresident is the one I have found most hospitable.   I accidentally first joined the most dirtbag left Sanders sub, lol (not chapo, but close). Found some good people even there though.   It seems to me like politically engaged people of many different stripes are freaked out right now because this election is so important.   I think we all need to find ways to chill. I try to be mindful of that aphorism, ‚ÄúBe kind, for everyone is fighting a great battle.‚Äù
Same. I got a real wake up call when I posted a (what I think was) fair criticism of a certain candidate not fully answering a debate question. 30 downvotes later and 2 people in my DMs calling me a partisan hack and a centrist made me refrain from commenting on the presidential race after that.
The change literally happened overnight. Up until mid-September, threads about the primary were filled with threads reminding everyone to vote blue no matter who, people complimenting each other's candidates, and generally civil discussion. And then literally overnight, it was filled to the brim with toxic people praising one candidate and insulting all others, and downvoting all dissenting opinions to hell.  I'm convinced that day in September was the day the botnets were fired up.
It's not likely an organic occurrence, FYI.
Echo chamber comes to mind

Jesus that's awful... wtf is wrong with some people?
That is f\*cking sad. How low.
Fun fact about Michael Bloomberg üëÄ
Should have stayed a model.
Today I learned, this sub is full of thirsty women and gay men.
... Wow this guy was seriously hot... damn it‚Äôs always the attractive ones that suck
Bloomberg sponsored her opponent? She should hit him with that repeatedly.
And then he crawled on up to New Hampshire, and claimed that being born at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, made him better than our own Senator Jeanne Shaheen ...  I'm always surprised he didn't try his luck in Maine after that, he was actually born on the Kittery side, lol
There was a funny SNL sketch when he was sworn in where he (Jon Hamm) kept walking into the Democratic leaders meeting and they kept daydreaming about him.
Saw Scott Brown speak once.... I can't imagine what Bloomberg was thinking, other than that Warren wouldn't sell out to special interests (e.g. billionaires).
I can't wait to watch her rip Bloomberg a new one in the Nevada debate. I hope she, Sanders, Buttigieg, Biden and Klobuchar all take a vow of solidarity to only attack Bloomberg and take turns visciously tearing him apart piece by piece.
Could see why he was popular haha. Even more impressive that she beat him!
Bloomberg has plenty of history donating to republican candidates. In 2016 he financed Pat Toomey in PA, which was a swing state.
Bloomberg is a DINO
He‚Äôs not even that good looking imo
I was just gonna say he‚Äôs um... not ugly
Is it any wonder? Have you seen Warren dish on her [thirst for The Rock?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/politics/celebrity-crush-20-questions.html#warren)
I'm a straight guy, but in the spirit of the great philosopher The Todd from Scrubs, I appreciate hot regardless of gender.
You might have a point! Haha
I thought most LGBT people were pulling for Buttigeg
Keep in mind whenever Warren talks about how she‚Äôs the only one on the debate stage who beat a popular Republican incumbent in the past 30 years, this is who she‚Äôs referring to.
At least we have [Tom Winter](https://mobile.twitter.com/NYTnickc/status/1228333195214626818), our candidate for Montana's at-large House seat.  Edit: also AOC, Joe Kennedy, Kamala Harris, Kyrsten Sinema, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker...Dems are way more attractive than the 95% angry old white dude party. Elise Stefanik is cute, and Marco Rubio is pretty good-looking, but other than that...
\*cough\*  \#TedBundy
I remember Warren poking fun at his centerfold past in a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day breakfast, saying that she was also a centerfold model [holds up a picture of herself in ‚ÄúConsumer Reports‚Äù]
Scott Brown is a totally fine guy. He‚Äôs just no Liz Warren
It is okay, he'll apologize. That's all it takes for some.
Seriously, she should be attacking billionaires and money in politics about as often as Sanders, their policies are not dissimilar
Yes Bloomberg, who was a republican at that time, supported a fellow Republican
[speaking of that old gem...](https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/new-senator/n12691)
Last I heard, he hadn‚Äôt actually qualified for the debate yet, though. But I would like to see it.
Yeah not a ton of substance though, he didn't really achieve much in his previous legislative terms. Also, this photo is like 40 years old üòÖ  I recall Warren beat him pretty comprehensively in the debates. It was the first time she really caught my attention and impressed me properly having actual policy knowledge. Whereas Brown was mostly rattling off the GOP talking points.
He's definitely ok looking üò≥
A himbo‚Äôs place is in the weight room.
On the outside...
Wowww. The look in her eyes when she says ‚ÄúThe Rockkkk‚Äù. Omg. I don‚Äôt know, I just, I just feel like my grandma just went full cougar in my presence.
Or talk about Bruce Mann?
Omg she is great
Wait... this is the best thing I‚Äôve seen.
A Warren supporter who likes scrubs and lives in Ohio?  Are you me?
I haven‚Äôt seen recent poll numbers but I know a couple months ago, most of the queer community was for sanders and warren.
Ironically all the queer people I know are Warren or Sanders. The only Buttigieg I know is my straight mom.
no.
https://www.out.com/election/2019/11/25/exclusive-warren-leads-among-lgbtq-voters-first-its-kind-poll
Just the wealthy Fire Island gays that sit around in speedos sipping on Cosmos.
I need to make a separate post about this because there is a case to be made that Buttigieg actually repels LGBT voters.  Queer people learn to pretend to be someone that they're not as soon as they hit puberty. We wear our mask so frequently that sometimes we convinced ourselves into believing our own lies. You become a master actor when your survival depends on your acting skill.  When I see Buttigieg, I see someone who has mastered that skill so well that he doesn't know how to stop performing. He wants to present an idyllic version of himself that straight people always wanted gay people to be ‚Äî suburban, middle-class, wealthy, ***normal*** ‚Äî but most gay people can see through that because we've all done that before.  Buttigieg seems especially inauthentic in the context of being gay because no one can possibly be that well-adjusted, there's got to be something fucked up about him inside. Even Klobuchar seems more real because at least she [allegedly](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/24/18218279/amy-klobuchar-fork-comb-bad-boss-binder-staffers-angry-management-style-explained) abuses her staff.  I'm just waiting for Buttigieg to crack under pressure. It's coming.
Lol, no
Yeah, all LGBT+ voted Pete, and all women voted Warren, and all POC voted Biden, and that's exactly how the DNC was able to give the nomination to Bloomberg to ensure 4 more years of Trump followed by the rise of full-on fascism.  CEASE with the identity politics.
I‚Äôm well aware that he‚Äôs a douche, I‚Äôve seen the way he attacked her back in 2012 and hate him for it, but...he‚Äôs still hot lmao...
Oh wow...good lord, why can‚Äôt we have any pretty ones in Texas, this ain‚Äôt fair
Dayum!
I‚Äôm ashamed but I live in Montana and this is the first I‚Äôm hearing of Tom Winter. Definitely going to go research him now!
Good lawwwd...
Daddy üòª
I think she attacks as often, just in different terms.  Honestly I think with a Sanders president, we end up with a lot of Warren's policies.
First time I've watched it...that is priceless.
That's good. I hope they don't let him in. I thought they already said he could do it.
Yeah I watched some old debate clips. He was rattled, while she projected cool confidence and intelligence.
Underated comment
Brown was an OK senator.  He lost because Warren was simply a much better choice.  If someone said. ‚ÄúA bimbo‚Äôs job is X‚Äù people would lose their minds here.  We don‚Äôt need to engage in sexism to promote Warren.
Those legs tho
As a wealthy Fire Island gay that sits around in my speedo sipping on Cosmos, how dare you think I don't support Warren?!
[removed]
As a gay person who grew up in the south who doesn‚Äôt hate Pete, I totally feel this from him. My boyfriend agreed with me as well that the fact that he has to project this perfected image of the gay guy that straight people WANT to see rather than who we naturally want to be absolutely feels like a subtle slap in the dick. We almost wish he would be more like AOC or Warren in the way they embrace the gayest of the gay parts of the gay community (going on drag race, vibing with drag queens, etc.) I get that it‚Äôs important to represent all different types of gay people, as I am also personally much closer to Pete‚Äôs level of gay than any yas Queen work slay the haus down boots gay that people somehow expect him to be.   Bottom line is the dude came out super late in life and grew up in red areas around socially conservative people. He is a product of his environment and there‚Äôs no changing who he is, as much as many other gays would like him to embrace the unapologetically gay side of himself.  I agree that something feels off. I don‚Äôt know a single gay person without some sort of serious hidden psychological damage from being gay. Maybe he will snap one day on something.
I mean, these photos are like 40 years old though.
LMAO right, MA is out here with actual centerfolds and all we get is human Blobfish Ted Cruz.
You have Beto O'Rourke.
He's actually a really solid candidate, as he's a current state rep from Missoula, so he should have a much better name recognition base than our previous two candidates for that seat. Plus it's an open seat!
[removed]
It was satire.
only if you think of minorities as single-issue voting morons, I guess...
>  as much as many other gays would like him to embrace the unapologetically gay side of himself.  He speaks openly and freely about his love for his husband, including physical displays of affection. How much more unapologetically gay do you expect him to be?  Frankly, it's extremely off putting that you feel he "will snap one day" simply becasue he's not the right kind of gay.
Wait, AOC and Warren do gay stuff? I doubt it, I would've seen it on Republican news already if it was true
[He‚Äôs still not... bad... looking. ](https://imgur.com/a/8gcuwVF) Of course now he‚Äôs cozied up to Trump & was offered an Ambassadorship.
Ok, well then he *was* hot back in the day. Never too late to appreciate a (formerly) fine specimen of man, even if it‚Äôs fizzled out now. Ex. The guy who plays Joey from Friends.  Also, tbh he still sorta has a silver fox look going for him
At least Cruz is totally a human being   https://www.tedcruzforhumanpresident.com
Meh
Removed rule four
That‚Äôs not what satire means and it is still sexist.
I think this isn‚Äôt an issue he can help. The resentment he‚Äôs getting from the gay community is an indirect result of the majority of gay people being physically unable to change/ maintain who we are in other ways (mannerisms, voice, non sexual preferences) in the way that he does. It‚Äôs like this unintended signal to the rest of us that says ‚Äú why can‚Äôt the rest of you guys be more normal like me and stop being so gay?‚Äù He sells the most acceptable and the least harmless version of being gay. It‚Äôs somewhat of a catch 22 because we know damn well that society would never elect someone who projects their gay identity in a  much more liberal and offensive (to straight people) way.  It‚Äôs probably not fair to suggest he will ‚Äúsnap one day.‚Äù Almost every gay person I‚Äôve met in NYC has had depression, anxiety, alcohol issues, taking some kind of medication, has some kind of mental health challenge due in some part to their experience growing up gay, so he just seems unrealistically perfect and unscathed that it makes the rest of us a little jealous. It‚Äôs like why he is not somewhat fucked up like me? What is he hiding? It‚Äôs probably nothing but the suspicion is there.
Example: https://1010wins.radio.com/articles/critics-slam-aoc-for-being-a-judge-on-rupauls-drag-race
Whelp, good point. If that's recent that's pretty great for 60.
lol
> physically unable to change/ maintain who we are in other ways (mannerisms, voice, non sexual preferences) in the way that he does.  What is your basis for the claim that he changes his voice/mannerisms/preferences?
My lived experience as a gay person as well as the lived experiences of many I know in the gay community suggests that he has permanently perfected an identity that is most appealing easiest to swallow for the straight man. Many gay people have felt this pressure growing up in school, the workplace, around family, to project a straighter, more masculine, more Christian/ patriotic persona so that the straight people around us can be put at ease. I don‚Äôt think he is changing who he is anymore. I think that he has put on this defensive persona that most of us in the closet have put on and are slowly starting to take off after years of straight conditioning ourselves. I think who he shows is legitimately who he is now, as he came out of the closet very very late in life. He‚Äôs not faking anything any more because he has perfected the most socially conservative and socially acceptable gay identity from years of being in the military, in a red state, a mayor, and now a presidential candidate.
Warren introduces bill to redirect wall money to coronavirus
I love this so much. Put a smile on my face when I saw it.
Check and mate.  Please let this woman become President.
Wow, she's full-time campaigning and is still doing her senate job better than the majority of other senators!  This bill is a good idea right now because people are legitimately worried about coronavirus and feel like there needs to be something done to fix it.  It might even make people re-think their hatred of immigrants by redirecting their fear to an actual threat.
Look at that. A practical approach to mitigating a problem instead of just getting riled up.
Now this is realpolitick.
Man, Warren had been *killing* it today.  If you go on /r/Politics, she's actually got a few topics on the front page!  Considering how Bernie-Centric that sub is, this is insane.
This does put a smile on my face.
Trump: China is terrible!  Also Trump: Let's build a...wait for it...*great* wall...
Sick buuurrrrrn  LOL. I am not sure who got triggered, but I am not being sarcastic. I am an avowed Warren supporter/volunteer. Jesus. It's a sick burn.
Trump Administration: "We have concluded the best solution to coronavirus is to build a wall to keep it out."
Hell YES!
A++ Trump Trolling
She's so awesome! She has endless energy and ideas for how to fix everything!
Warren. Gets. Shit. DONE!   Meanwhile, this story is struggling valiantly against being buried on /r/politics  by horrified Warren opponents...
She‚Äôs my 2nd choice, but I seriously wish she would‚Äôve run in 2016.
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
But proposing actual solutions is so much harder than just yelling about the problem.
That sub has gotten out of control. I‚Äôm a Pete guy, so obviously I was never going to find positive coverage of *him* there. But I also like Liz and it irritates me how that sub has sidelined her.
Thanos endorses Warren!
Does anyone know where the multiple $300,000 individual donations from Sander's dark money group Our Revolution are coming from?
What's stopping St. Bernard from using the money from his Super PAC? :) :)
There have been no reported coronavirus cases in Mexico, or anywhere in South America as far as I'm aware. There's over 50 here in the US. If anything, the wall would protect Mexicans from us at this rate.
Removed: Rule 7.  You might have just been making a joke, but it is factually incorrect and in this age I can no longer tell when people are being sarcastic or genuinely believe very dumb things.
A small price to pay for salvation.
Don‚Äòt worry. The US health system ensures that there is an upper ceiling for the cases. Last night Maddow mentioned 500 tests in the US so far which is a good way of limiting the people diagnosed with it.
a perfect *snap back* to Trump
Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs Campaign Is Telling Key Supporters To De-Escalate From The Fight With Bernie Sanders
Because the ‚Äúfight‚Äù is being manufactured by CNN for drama for the debates tonight. Bernie and Warren are on the same team - progress!
This is such ridiculous manufactured drama. Saying "I don't know if a woman can win", or "I'm worried a woman can‚Äôt win" and/or "She‚Äôs going to be clobbered by sexist attacks" are **not** sexist statements.  It's ok to be worried!  Most Democrats have PTSD from 2016; we're living in perpetual fear.  My brain is telling me Warren is the best candidate, and will run circles around Trump on a debate stage, and this election is going to be a blowout, that Trump's base has shrunk since 2016, the 1% in three states parlay won't happen again, and there will be no Comey letter is going to save him, but I'm still going to have this latent irrational fear and dread until we finally kick him out on Tuesday, November 3.  Am I supposed to be mad at Bernie if he shares my sentiments?  There's **zero** chance that he said anything like "I don't think a woman should be president", so why are we discussing this?
I just really hope they start tonight's debate off with a joint statement of some sort condemning the smear pieces that were tailor made to cause fighting between the two camps.
I love Mom and Dad and CNN cant stop me.

(I'm a bot) ***** > CLIVE, Iowa - Elizabeth Warren&#039;s campaign is telling key online supporters that their &quot;Goal is de-escalation&quot; and warning backers not to accuse Bernie Sanders of sexism, signaling a desire to move on from a story that has driven a rift between two longtime allies, and within the progressive community, over questions of gender and electability.  > On Monday night, about five minutes after Warren issued a statement confirming that she remembers Sanders telling her in a private meeting he didn&#039;t believe a woman could win in 2020, one of Warren&#039;s campaign officials advised supporters in a large pro-Warren group chat on Twitter that their next step would be to dial back the confrontation.  > The next morning, hours before Warren and Sanders were expected to address the conflict in Des Moines at Tuesday&#039;s Democratic debate, the campaign official followed up to caution supporters against accusing Sanders of sexism, saying that the line of questioning would be &quot;Really bad news for us."   ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/eoqif8/elizabeth_warrens_campaign_is_telling_key/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.02, ~458432 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **Warren**^#1 **Sanders**^#2 **campaign**^#3 **two**^#4 **woman**^#5
r/politics comments are a total shitshow. There are a handful of comments I‚Äôve read today that call Bernie a sexist (doubt that was any of you - Fox News is running with the ‚ÄúBernie is sexist‚Äù narrative so it‚Äôs more likely to be bots and Trumpers stirring things up) but the vast majority are attacks aimed at Warren, claims that her campaign is over, etc from Bernie supporters and bots.   I cannot believe people fell for this so hard. It was bound to happen at some point. But it‚Äôs clear to me this was a manufactured controversy and a misunderstanding, the only people who benefit are people who don‚Äôt want a progressive and the MAGA crowd. Because now both Warren AND Sanders look bad. Warren to Sanders supporters and Sanders to non-progressives. UGH.
Guys. Sanders supporter here. Let‚Äôs not fall for it. Please. We have the same goals and Warren and Bernie are good friends. If sanders wins I‚Äôd hope to see her take a prominent position in the cabinet or even as senate majority leader, and vice versa if Liz wins. Don‚Äôt let the corporate media divide progressives. This is completely deliberate
All the people who say Warren‚Äôs campaign leaked this are idiots. Why would she leak something and purposefully try to de escalate it when she was forced to respond by the media? It doesn‚Äôt make any sense
The Parnas documents released today show that we have a criminal enterprise running this country. Let's focus on that - and voting it out - and save the acrimony for Trump.
Ask yourself who really benefits from the toxicity in this thread.  Never would I have dreamed that we'd have two progressives leading the polls. This is an exciting time.
This whole thing is just a bunch of noise designed to divide progressives.
I don't personally know a single Bernie or Warren supporter that has fallen for this bullshit.  We support different people, but so far none of my Bernie supporting friends have fallen for it, and I'm also not buying into it.
[deleted]
I'm sure Bernie will be right along to tell his people the same...  Getting a little tired of the olive branches coming out only when we are mad.  EDIT: This whole thing was Sen Warren getting screwed because a man said something to her and when asked about it, she told the truth. It's abject that she and her campaign are now forced to de-escalate when no one has ever taken the same course of action when attacking her.
I'd love to see Warren and Sanders do [something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrBXcKcviuc) - handshake, photo-op and all.
I'm going to boycott the CNN debate to protest their asinine hack manufactured drama reporting. I hope all Warren and Sanders supporters join me
That manufactured fight is ridiculous. I'm glad that neither of them let CNN dominate that, and instead they turned it into "A woman absolutely can become president."  I'm a Sanders supporter, but if he doesn't get the nomination, I hope it's Warren.
So on the debate tonight, Elizabeth basically said that Bernie DID tell her that a woman couldn't win? Why would she not just shut this down right there on the stage if she wanted to deescalate the fight?
Great, let's see if Bernie does the same.
Honestly this just makes it more clear that the leak didn‚Äôt come from Warren‚Äôs camp as some are trying to claim.  I hate how some are trying to spin the narrative against her because she made a comment when asked to comment. It‚Äôs clear she doesn‚Äôt want to escalate.
Yet the plot (or the script) thickens...  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/14/sanders-admits-anti-warren-script-early-states-098786
The main thing I want to see is of Bernie Campaign is manufacturing scripts to go after Liz, then why not just own it? Say it was a low level staffer and that it wasn't a big deal and move on. It's his campaign and I'm pretty upset that my vote isn't being considered now that "vote blue nomatter who" is okay now that Bernie has the lead, when it wasn't when he was trailing?
Bernie supporter coming in peace - I really hope no one here ACTUALLY believes that Sanders is a sexist or thinks a woman cannot or should not be President.   I‚Äôm a little sad that Warren pushes this idea and ‚Äúwon‚Äôt speak on it further‚Äù while Bernie‚Äôs side of the argument is starting to be corroborated.
I really don't want to believe that this bullshit ends her campaign, but it feels like the kind of bullshit that would because this country is a mess.
I donated to both of them for a few weeks early in and the spam is exhausting now.
Well, looks like Bernie supporters aren't doing the same judging by the "Video emerges of Sanders saying in 1988 a woman could be elected president" thread comments on /r/politics.
I haven't seen any actual supporters fighting with each other.
Bernie supporter here. This is all manufactured nonsense. There has been no toxicity on either side, just legitimate criticisms. Critique does not equal toxicity.
based on tonight's performance...she didn't de-escalate it though
We're on the same team brothers and sisters.
I wish I had seen this earlier, but it was fun watching people misunderstanding logic and fallacies all day.
I'm glad they're not letting the media manufacture a fake rivalry. Warren's handling of this was fine. Bernie's record clearly demonstrates he's not sexist. Warren's record clearly demonstrates she doesn't get wrapped up in this type of divisive mudslinging.    All of the blame for this goes to the corporate, centrist, establishment media that works tirelessly to undermine progressives and prop up candidates that serve their agenda. They are the reason Trump got elected. They built him up for reality TV and obsessed over his campaign because it was good for business. As a Sanders supporter I would be a fool to consider Warren an ally right now, but she's certainly not an enemy and I definitely have no interest in beefing with her supporters, seeing as we agree on everything. She's a policy genius. We need her and more people like her in government.
I'm not sure either Bernie or Warren can win the primary over Biden alone (and I'm a Sanders supporter). But together - together they can.
ITT: "Bernie supporter here..."
Ignoring misogyny emboldens misogynists. Emboldening misogynists is not leadership, it's the opposite; it's cowardice.  Ignoring misogyny is wrong. And doing so simply because you're scarred of BernieBros just makes them right.

I like both Bernie and Warren, but honestly this situation doesn‚Äôt leave a good taste in my mouth regarding Warren. On the surface it seems like some of her people told this story to CNN the day before the debate in order to gain some traction in the polls, but then Warren refuses to say much about it. I know primary politics get dirty, but it just seems of Warren was really concerned about Bernie being a sexist, she would have brought this up immediately back in 2018. Also her backing away somewhat from M4A hasn‚Äôt help imo either. I still like that she‚Äôs more nuanced and eloquent than Bernie, but I‚Äôm not a fan of some these latest developments.

Warren supporter with Bernie as a tentative second. When this came out (just the CNN headline) my first thought was ‚Äúthere is no way he said that‚Äù. When Warren added context to it, I wasn‚Äôt mad at all. I interpreted his comment the same way you did. A LOT of us have that anxiety. We all saw what happened in 2016. I‚Äôm not mad at Bernie for pointing true things out. My opinion of him is unchanged. He‚Äôs not a sexist.   Who I am mad at are the people on Reddit and Twitter trashing Elizabeth over this, making assumptions and hyperbolic claims, twisting what was said to fit their opinion. All it does is further the divide. It seems many online are new voters or new to politics or just plain didn‚Äôt learn their lesson in 2016. I am trying really, *really* hard not to let this entire thing affect my vote. I support him, but his most vocal supporters over the last few months (years arguably) especially now with how they treat opposing candidates (especially if they‚Äôre female) have really left me feeling frustrated and angry. Just man some of them can be really...like, I like my candidate too, but they take it to another level. And it can‚Äôt be all bots either, there are way too many for that to be the case.   I was on the fence about voting for Sanders in another primary and if Warren drops out, I don‚Äôt know if I will now. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the thing that pushed me over the edge but it made me kind of reconsider my primary vote. Am I wrong in feeling this way? Maybe. Thoughts are welcome.  General vote is blue no matter who, obviously.  Edit: Thanks for the thoughts guys! I definitely haven‚Äôt made a decision about my second choice candidate, but Warren is still my first! Make sure to donate and show your support, if you indeed support her!
This is what I came here for. I believe Warren, and I think she‚Äôs right that it isn‚Äôt something we should fight over because I don‚Äôt think he meant a woman SHOULDN‚ÄôT be president. People turning this into a ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù fight are exactly the reason Bernie is right that a woman will run at an automatic disadvantage.
>There's **zero** chance that he said anything like "I don't think a woman should be president", so why are we discussing this?   To be fair, this was never a suggestion of any of the reporting.
I'm not saying I necessarily agree with this, but some people believe the implication is him discouraging Warren to run to make room for himself.  I have been saying for awhile now that I think its REALLY important to remember who declared first. which makes me look side eyed at a bunch of shit not just this issue. I knew they HAD to have a conversation before she announced..like way before she announced. If he thinks so highly of her, and they align on A LOT of stuff, and he wanted her to run in '16..why did he announce after?  She started her "exploratory committee" in Dec. She announced early Feb. He announced ~2 weeks later.
>Am I supposed to be mad at Bernie if he shares my sentiments?  >There's zero chance that he said anything like "I don't think a woman should be president", so why are we discussing this?  I agree with the this thought process, but what irks me is his response.  If they did have a conversation regarding the issue of Trump attacking based on gender, does he not have the diplomacy to say something like "I never intended for it to come out that way, and Im sorry if my friend, Elizabeth Warren, took it the wrong way."   He just stuck to his guns, and kept with his always angry old man attacks everyone schtick. He didn't try to diffuse.   Combined with how he was the day before by blaming his staff or low level volunteers instead of taking the slightest bit of responsibility. Any other candidate would have at least said they would work with staff closer going forward to ensure this doesnt happen because its not the campaign we run, blah blah blah. It just was "not me, not my fault".    ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è For fucks sake just have some diplomacy Bernie.
> This is such ridiculous manufactured drama. Saying "I don't know if a woman can win", or "I'm worried a woman can‚Äôt win" and/or "She‚Äôs going to be clobbered by sexist attacks" are not sexist statements. It's ok to be worried! Most Democrats have PTSD from 2016; we're living in perpetual fear.  This is my thought.  I believe a woman can win, and I want a woman to win, but the reality is that misogyny still exists in America in 2020.  The bar is higher for women. I think that Hillary Clinton would have won in 2016 with the exact same platform and the exact same record if she were male.  Assuming this report is true, then Bernie likely said something along those lines, rather than, "A woman shouldn't be President."  This is a man who openly stated that he wanted a woman President 3 decades ago.  And on top of that, Warren has had nothing but good things to say about Bernie even while they're campaigning for the same office.  I don't think she's the type who would let him slide if he said something bad.  This whole debacle is a non-issue for me unless Warren says it happened.  Until then, they're both excellent candidates and I'll very happily campaign for either of them.
It's not feasible to me Bernie would say that without there being some sort of unstated qualification or context.  It doesn't sit with his values or track record and I would say it doesn't track with his memory. Everyone in 2016 thought that a woman was ***about to*** win the presidency. You'd have to have a very poor memory to think a woman couldn't win.
Exactly.
> There's zero chance that he said anything like "I don't think a woman should be president", so why are we discussing this?  Because that's exactly the message that's come from the Warren campaign, at exactly the moment when campaigns dump their opposition research file ahead of a vote. You don't believe the insinuation. I don't believe the insinuation. Warren's campaign is doing the insinuation...and it's not okay!
Eloquently spoken
> will run circles around Trump on a debate stage  There's not gonna be any debates between Trump and the Democratic nominee. Put it out of your mind. Trump will not do it, he can't control it. This is going to be rallies only

Warren doubled down on Bernie saying it.  what does that say about Warren?
‚ÄúThere's zero chance that he said anything like "I don't think a woman should be president", so why are we discussing this?‚Äù  Except there‚Äôs 100% chance he said this, because Warren said he did.
[deleted]
>There's zero chance that he said anything like "I don't think a woman should be president", so why are we discussing this?  Well, because she said that he thinks a woman couldn't win and he said that he didn't. Who do we believe? That's why there's a discussion. Very simply: who do we believe? It's impossible for us to know who's lying. And one of them is.
the only people going with the CNN spin are the borderline anti-Semitic former Hillary folks it seems. this entire thing is cringe.
dude, check twitter. ridiculous and manufactured, yes, but Berners are eating it up. it's unbelievable
I think that‚Äôd be the best case scenario for both parties. I hope they can see right through the attempt to divide the 2 progressive candidates
And condemning CNN
Yikes.
Warren fumbled the ball on that one
[removed]
This is important but I have a feeling that the quote Warren gave is going to be the ammunition the Bernie minority has been craving. They won‚Äôt back down until he says something either defending Elizabeth‚Äôs viewpoint and acknowledging how she could‚Äôve perceived differently what he said while still defending himself. Either way, this is all bad for Warren and does more to fire up Bernie‚Äôs base than hers. Really bummed this story came out the time it did. Hoping this is an online thing that doesn‚Äôt register on the ground but I guess we‚Äôll find out soon enough.
I don't people are falling for it per se. A lot of Bernie supporters,even the ones I know in real life, hate Warren. They're most likely jumping at a chance to make her look bad. So many of them automatically disbelieved her and still do, and got more emboldened with that WaPo article. As if another anonymous source is anymore valid. I'm not saying all Sanders supporters, but the nice ones seem to be a rarity.
Yep, our best move by far is to show them that we're better than this.  Solidarity ‚úä, my Sanders-supporting friend!
My best advice to everyone is when they see people attacking Sanders or Warren, remind them they are doing Trumps dirty work. The only winner in promoting this as a legitimate issue is Donald Trump. It takes away from the major news bombshells of the day like all of the Ukraine evidence that just came out and divides Democrats.
Honestly to me, if she didn't leak it, I don't understand why she would have confirmed the story in her statement. I don't understand why she wouldn't have said "The account of this conversation was leaked against my will and its contents are inaccurate and obscure the real truth. Bernie and I are allies and always have been."  Would have been so easy, would have put the whole thing to bed immediately.
> All the people who say Warren‚Äôs campaign leaked this ~~are idiots~~ seemed oddly coordinated.  I'd bet that was mostly driven by 40% Russians, 40% US Based "Troll farms", and 20% of the most gullible Bernie supporters.
[deleted]
People make mistakes I guess. Releasing her DNA test also backfired. The folks in the Sanders campaign also made a mistake with the recent anti-Warren scripts. It just strains credulity that 4 people coordinated behind the back of her campaign and that those 4 people aren‚Äôt involved in her campaign if they were so close in her orbit in December 2018. She‚Äôs building a truly historic campaign, is it conceivable that 4 people who were close to her in December 2018 decided to sit it out?  I‚Äôll vote for whoever (Bernie or Liz) is ahead when my state votes. This story made to start a fight will be gone from my memory.
[removed]
Nate Silver is one of those idiots as well.
Well it definitely didn't come from Bernie's campaign   [Nate Silver](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1216931979893137408) said it best
Because going negative often backfires. You want your opponents to look bad, but you don't want your candidate looking like they're being negative. Hence, you have people on your staff who do the dirty work instead so that the candidate can look high-minded.
Because they thought it was a politically safe move but then got backlash from it.
It *could* have better optics. She‚Äôd be able to make Bernie look worse without looking petty or actually attacking him.      What I don‚Äôt understand is why she didn‚Äôt shake his hand
Sure looks like it's working. Pretty sad. Seems we haven't changed from 2016. Americans are still easily susceptible to emotional manipulation. Until that changes, we'll always fall into these kind of traps.
Designed by who? Warren seems to be loving it.
Same. I have a range of politically active friends who support Bernie, Warren, Buttigieg, and Yang - nobody I know is buying into this. This is some manufactured garbage-news.
Bernie supporter here - you're spot on. I love Elizabeth and could smell this BS from the start.
She spent almost the entire statement praising Bernie, she isn‚Äôt calling him a sexist. She wants to deescalate and move on.  The sexism charge to Bernie won‚Äôt stick. Fox news will try to push it, but Trump is an overt sexist, and Biden basically openly implied what Bernie said to Warren, but out in the open three weeks ago. The only way this has staying power is if the toxic reaction to Warren  liners and intensifies. It IS sexist, and it sucks. Thankfully I‚Äôve seen a lot of Bernie supporters here at least who understand that and are ready to move on.
Absolutely spot on. Bernie doesn't do a lot of apologizing for some of the toxic stuff done by his campaign at times, yet every single thing the Warren campaign does gets scrutinized to death by the media. The implicit sexism in the coverage is just accepted as the default, and it's nauseating.
It‚Äôs exactly what they wanted when they released the fake news story that Bernie was instructing his volunteers to attack Warren... progressives fighting amongst each other.
Instead she snubbed him
This really should be higher, I think these questions need to be answered, to clarify what her position is.
Maybe because he did say it.
He won't and his people  especially won't.
I won't hold my breath. He seems to be following the same pattern of 2016. His cultists too.
Of course he will.  He will address the CNN question as quick as possible, compliment Warren and look to pivot toward Biden and social security.  It will be over and done with inside of about 25 seconds.  Believe it or not, Bernie cares about issues and is a veteran politician.  He will be on message.
  Bernie was the one smeared here, he is clearing is name and asking Warren to explain herself with an exact statement of what she thinks he supposedly said, something she has yet to do
Isn't it funny that lots of these stories are coming from Politico?  A site well-known for its anti-Bernie bias?
> Say it was a low level staffer and that it wasn't a big deal and move on.  That's more or less what he said.
Biden backs free public university tuition in olive branch to progressives
Lot of making the best be the enemy of the good in this thread. Do people not want to pull the mainstream in our direction?
I'm not saying we should stop pushing (never!), but I will say Biden's moves in the last week have greatly alleviated my concerns.  He now backs Warren's bankruptcy plans, decriminalization of marijuana, national $15 minimum wage, a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United, and now this.   I mean, obviously I'm not going to get everything I want! But such is the nature of progress. This is a platform I can be excited about.
Hi everyone - putting this article here because it talks specifically about a policy Warren cosponsored and now Biden is endorsing going forward. From the article:   ‚ÄúBiden's plan mirrors Sanders' 2017 "College for All Act," which would make public college and university tuition free for those whose families earn less than $125,000 per year. That measure was co-sponsored by Warren and two other former 2020 contenders, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand.‚Äù  Woot! Glad to see Warren and Sanders weighing their influence on Biden.
OK sorry everyone I posted the wrong link from CNN, but here are the sources to support this:  From Biden‚Äôs official twitter account: https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1239280176594288643?s=20  From CNN: https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/politics/joe-biden-free-public-university-tuition/index.html  From The Hill: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/487688-biden-says-hell-adopt-plans-from-sanders-warren  Thanks all, sorry about that (*face palm*).
Good...good... Let the policy flow through you.
This is so great. Rather than the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always right‚Äù attitude, Biden seems to genuinely unite the Democratic Party.  I honestly don‚Äôt know why Bernie is still in the race after everything, and it looks like a repeat of 2016.  At this point, having seen Biden‚Äôs response to the crisis and him actually courting the progressive vote with such olive branches, he‚Äôs not only earned by vote but also my support.
GOOD. Honestly I think we have to accept that his nomination is inevitable at this point. The more progressive plans and programs he promises to adopt, the better! It's not going to be Warren level excellence but any shift to the left is better than slipping down the middle of the road on a river of milquetoast.      I received a text from his campaign today asking for my vote. I responded saying I voted for Liz, that I was glad he has endorsed Warren's bankruptcy bill but I want to see more commitment to the progressive agenda and to appointing progressive women and POC to positions of power. The volunteer said they are hearing a lot of that and that Biden looks forward to "working closely" with Warren and other progressives. He's certainly not my dream candidate, but at least he's showing willingness to adapt and listen (so far).
I want to point out that Hillary supported this in 2016 as well.
This is actually historically unusual. Usually a presidential nominee has to go toward the center.
He may not have always been right, buy I believe he has always meant to do right. I would have prefered Lizzie, or Sander's, but I'd be 100% ok with seeing Biden in the oval next year.
I volunteered at a fund raiser Biden attended around 2007.  After the event, he did a stump speech for the volunteers.  Mostly college aged, he mentioned free college during it.  Personally, it felt kinda pandering and not sincere.  But I will give him the benefit of the doubt here since the entire party platform is slowly shifting left.
Hoping he follows through on some of these progressive policies. I just worry since the $$$ behind Biden is definitely not for this.
Now do Universal Healthcare.
I mean, he‚Äôs not gonna fight to death for this sort of legislation, right? Is this just him signalling?
excellent. Biden's recent moves are making me feel a lot better about the progress we might make if he becomes president. It also tells me he's serious about winning over disillusioned younger voters.
Really wish he picked universal childcare instead
I'm about to graduate so I won't benefit from this, so it's a little disappointing. But I think about my three nephews, especially my sister's kids, who probably couldn't afford college and I'm excited for them. Hopefully Joe can be pushed a little more
That's quite the leap.  I actually find it odd he's jumping from bankruptcy to this.  Let's talk filibuster and court packing, please.  Also, arresting Trump.  Because the Supreme Court and filibuster will stop everything Biden is claiming he is supporting now.
If he really wants to get young people out to vote for him, he should promise to legalize marijuana.  Honestly, young people are really unreliable voters; this might motivate them to get up off their butts and vote.  Basically it's a bribe.  Also a good policy.
Good, but I want a green new deal too!
Based on a lot of the comments here and in other political subreddits it seems like some progressives don‚Äôt care about actual policy ‚Äî they just want Bernie and/or Warren no exceptions. Not the best approach when trying to get actual policy through and enact actual change. It takes a team, not an individual.   I for one am happy Biden is open to these ideas and willing to add them to his *already progressive* platform. Especially a policy he clashed with Warren on. It shows he has the ability to change his points of view with new information, and that is exactly one of the things I love so much about Elizabeth.  Things didn‚Äôt turn out exactly how we wanted this time around but at least we‚Äôve got a likely nominee with tons of experience, a willingness to listen to people, and an ability to bring people over to his side and turn out record voters. Biden wasn‚Äôt my first choice but I‚Äôm not going to bitch about it. I‚Äôm tired of the bitching. I accept his olive branch and I‚Äôll vote for him in my primary tomorrow and in November if he‚Äôs the guy, which by all indications he will be.
Great.  What's gonna be done about student loans? Where's my Public Service Loan Forgiveness that was promised to me when I signed the loan paperwork? Does Public Service Loan Forgiveness still count as earned income for tax purposes? Do I still loose all my years of public service when I was in a Stafford Loan instead of a Direct Loan?

Obvious lip service.

That's nice. All the moderates can like it now because Joe is for it.
Aaaand student loans????

aka getting desperate for this debate
So can we get rid of fluff degrees and only ensure people that deserve to be in college be in college?
That‚Äôs the argument I wrote in a different thread only to be hounded be Bernie or bust comments.
You did it! You broke the Sanders campaign down to its bare essentials.
[removed]
I think there is some fair skepticism to be had though. It‚Äôs great to see these things on the platform, but Joe really needs to be saying who (at least behind closed doors) he is going to get to work on them. Otherwise, they are just words. When he is as flip-floppy on marijuana and other issues as he is, it makes it hard to believe he will actually fight for these policies and not just move to other higher priority items on his agenda. Finally, I think he risks pleasing nobody if he can‚Äôt tie all of these more progressive policies back to his brand. It‚Äôs one thing to adopt Warren or Bernie‚Äôs ideas, but he has to make sure they actually jive with his campaign message and aren‚Äôt just tacked on in order to appease progressives. If he can‚Äôt, he risks frightening the moderates and independents he claims he can get. Just my two cents. I‚Äôm not angered by the partial plan, merely skeptical that these actually represent something Biden will fight for.
They don't, and this has been the problem with Bernie's base for years. What Bernie's base wants is an exclusive club only they get to be members of. They were here first! It's their turn!  I will never vote for a candidate these people support again. Their ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory is truly remarkable. When there's 30 candidates in the race, and the only ones who endorse you are  the fucking healing crystals lady, and DeBlasio, YOU are the problem.
Joe Biden, the Senator from MBNA, is reaching left on education and bankruptcy issues. It's fucking great.  Warren deserves a lot of credit for running a campaign of detailed and truly intelligent policy that made this sort of thing palatable to a wider spectrum of the Democratic base.  We collectively chose wrong, but I think she did real good in moderating the '16 Hillary & Bernie schism.
We want extreme climate action and single payer healthcare. This is good, but not the best thing he could have offered. The loan damage is done for most of us. Loan forgiveness and finding a way to bring cost down would have been far better.
And what some progressives miss is this the most progressive platform of our lifetime. To get all this would be a gigantic step forward and is pretty far left for the vast majority of this country
> "He now backs Warren's bankruptcy plans, decriminalization of marijuana, national $15 minimum wage, a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United, and now this."  That's not 'now'. Other than the bankruptcy plan, those other issues have been on his website his entire campaign
And let‚Äôs be real. We know which progressive is pushing the charge to get him further left behind the scenes. It isn‚Äôt the old man yelling on TV right now.
The problem with the $15 minimum wage movement is by the time it finally gets passed it will be outdated and not be high enough to make a difference.  Any minimum wage increased needs to be set in stone as a %annual increase that keeps up with inflation. That way we dont have to do this national bullshit where it's all or nothing.
I did not realize that he backed decriminalizing marijuana.  These are all good.  I'd like to see some progress on climate change, anti corruption and wealth tax and then I would be over the moon with joy!
Tbf to Biden, be supported all of that former stuff the entirety of his campaign.
Just give me universal healthcare and he‚Äôs got my confidence

The online contingent has now realised that Bernie‚Äôs path has closed, and we‚Äôre seeing a LOT more of an effort to push people to vote 3rd party or not vote. These olive branches will be helpful for the majority of rational progressives, but there will always be that minority who want to feel exceptionally pure and re-elect Trump to affirm their accelerationist/Marxist transitional theory. Not sure what to do with them but downvote liberally.
It was very encouraging to see he changed positions on the bankruptcy bill, but his change on college tuition isn't much. It's basically what Hillary's position was in 2016. While I don't think it's unreasonable to have some income limits in place (so taxpayers aren't paying for Donald Trump's kids to go to school, as Hillary put it), I wish Biden had adopted Warren's plan to cancel student loan debt.
> I honestly don‚Äôt know why Bernie is still in the race after everything  He's trying to focus the platform that Biden has to use and push him more progressive.  That's it.  And that's a good thing for progressives.  Bernie isn't damaging Biden at this point, he's just forcing him to the left.  And if you think that's a problem just look at the idiot who Biden will run against.  Getting the left wing out matters, even though we know the young turks won't turn out there are plenty on the left that Biden needs to consolidate.  Bernie is making him do that, and that is good for everyone who thinks Trump needs to go.
He will drop out after tonights debate or soon therafter. He is in there exactly for compromises like this. HRC made a lot of concessions to him and he paid her with a lot of compaigning effort. Too bad we couldn't get Wisocnsin, Michigan and PA to buy on her.
> I honestly don‚Äôt know why Bernie is still in the race after everything, and it looks like a repeat of 2016.  We can't know for sure either way, but consider the possibility that the college tuition thing might not be happening at all if Bernie was already out of the race.

Never thought I'd see people begging for more empty campaign promises from politicians lol
I mean he said he'd veto it so...
True, but at least we know he would sign it if Congress passed it/wouldn't intervene to water it down. Nothing outside of maybe HR 1 and giving DACA people a clear and quick path to citizenship is getting done without abolishing the filibuster anyway. Unless the plan is to pick one major thing to do each year through budget reconciliation I guess.
its a legitimate concern. i guess it's better than nothing, but i'll believe it when i see it.
It's up to us to vote down ticket. With House + Senate the picture will look different
Yeah, I see this as a good thing, but I'm not overly excited about it -- I feel like biggest positive action Warren would have had on the presidency wasn't the big platform items, even Biden will have a difficult time getting free tuition through Congress and will definitely be less dedicated to making sure it passes and doesn't get watered down. It was her emphasis on 'personnel is policy' and underlying structural changes that Biden likely will not want to touch.
I 100% agree. Next he needs to forgive undergraduate student loans - it‚Äôs only fair. Otherwise it is like decriminalizing marijuana but not releasing people from previous marijuana convictions. You have to retroactively apply the policies IMO.
They can bail out Wall Street for 14 trillion but sorry we can't pay for ur old loans. God I hate the government sometimes
He was detained in South Africa. He simply misspoke and corrected himself later
I know Medicare for all is super important, but I‚Äôm not a one issue voter and I see a lot of value when a politician as moderate as Biden starts vocally supporting these ideas. If he is the nominee, he will in a way define the Democratic Party especially if he is president. So if this idea and others like it become the new normal for moderate democrats, that‚Äôs a great thing and I can imagine health care will shortly follow. Possibly under Biden, more likely not IMO, but time will tell.  ‚ÄúWe take the win. We come back, and ask for more.‚Äù - Elizabeth Warren.
Covid-19 imo isn‚Äôt showing that M4A is solution (though it is ultimately as an overarching policy). What it does show is the need for a competent executive branch. Even if M4A was fully working right now it would do nothing to stop a spread of a pandemic considering the executive branch called it a hoax for weeks. Competent leadership and a setup to touch multiple agencies inside the federal govt is what we need now more than ever (which the Obama Administration had). We need M4A but let us not talk as if it‚Äôs a cure all, in this case it isn‚Äôt. Italy and the UK have M4A like systems and that has nothing to do with what they are dealing with.
Dude, all the countries with bad outbreaks have universal health care.   The differences are in how the government and populace reacted. Universal healthcare is great but won't overcome Westerns radical individualism.
Biden already supports universal healthcare. So did Hillary and every other Democratic candidate in the race. Single-payer is not the only way to get to universal healthcare‚Äîjust ask half the countries in Europe that have achieved universal healthcare without getting rid of private insurance.
He supports getting to universal healthcare through incremental changes. Repeat after me: M4A is not the only form of universal healthcare.
Washingtonian here! I think after the coronavirus, we really won't need to worry. This stuff is really wild and we are getting hit hard. People will support Medicare for all because it will save lives.  I will be voting blue no matter who. History has shown era's of progressivism typically follow after terrible crisis.
He does through a public option.  Italy has universal healthcare.  They are in lockdown right now.  If we had Sanders plan that makes private insurance illegal for stuff like this Donald Trump would currently be in charge of your healthcare.  M4A would not solve this.
Removed for Rule 4.
So edgy.
Despite his overwhelming funding lead, Sanders utterly failed to energize voters and now has a 0% chance of winning the nomination. But somehow I'm supposed to believe Biden is the desperate one. lol
Because education is for selling your labor and not improving your self and understanding of the world.
Yea we need to ignore them, and just be the grown-ups of the progressive wing.  There is absolutely no way that moderate/centrist/establishment figures like Biden, enacting progressive policy, is not fantastic news to progressives everywhere.  This has always been about dragging the country Left - you cannot just teleport people to a new location - you physically drag them from point A, to point B - and that means passing through every left-leaning position along the way.  That's The Fight.
They are probably Russian bots, and a few Bernouts

You did it! You massively generalized a very diverse group of individuals to one crude  generalization!
I'm sorry, but this sort of generalization is no better than the attacks from the other side. You're making things worse.
Removed for Rule 4.
I definitely get it, but to be blunt, right now the choice is in between some modest improvements under Biden, and four more years of hell  under Trump. I know which I'm picking.
His plan halves income-based repayments to 5% of discretionary and makes the forgiven amount untaxable. And I believe if you make under 25k, loan interest is paused. That would make student loans much more affordable for many people.
Unless he's just making empty promises to win and then as soon as he wins he walks them back. It's nice to hear but I will believe it when I see it.
Yes, I didn't mean to imply all of these positions have been adopted in the last week, or something (although some have). But they are all, *as of this moment,* part of his policy proposals. I apologize if that was not stated clearly.
Well, it is a bit due to him. He does yell awful loud. ;)
I will go out on a limb and say it's the pragmatic progressive who gets sh\*t done, like the CPFB; instead of the performative populist who yells about things and gets nothing done.
Yuuuup. It's hilarious (sad) how long we've been fighting for this while minimum wage has remained completely stagnant. Same thing will happen after we pass it, and we will always be 5-10 years behind.
I hope the legislation has a built in raise for inflation.
He's adopting Bernie's bill from 2017, not Bernie's plan from the campaign

I understand your concern - this isn‚Äôt Warren‚Äôs nor Bernie‚Äôs plan from their presidential campaigns. *But it is a step in the right direction and speaks to the influence of Progressives on a moderate like Joe Biden.*
Removed for Rule 4.  Also, this refers to Sanders' 2017 "College for All Act":  https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/college-for-all-act-introduced
Removed for Rule 3.  Also, this is Bernie's 2017 plan, which did indeed include an income qualifier.
Don‚Äôt worry. Most of them won‚Äôt show up to vote anyway.
I wouldn't be surprised if he does in the future. I think he can't adopt a million progressive policies at once without alienating the moderate side. We need to unite as a party, if covid-19 has shown us anything, we need to get Trump out.   Our economy is going to take a dive and I can't see how they don't find a way to forgive student loan debt for federal loans. Without it, people won't be able to stay afloat. Thank god we have Warren in the senate to push on these things.
I mean Hillary and her positions were pretty progressive, despite what the Bernie camp would have you believe. She championed universal healthcare and did more for it than Bernie ever did.  That said, I think student loan forgiveness be a hard sell for a lot of reasons.  For one, college has benefits in the form of earning potential and those that couldn‚Äôt afford to get a loan get a double whammy - they not only make less but those that got an education get their loans forgiven. So how do you make it fair to those that chose not to get a college education because their family and personal circumstances made it hard for them?  Plus, if you‚Äôre in family that saved up to pay for your tuition while others didn‚Äôt, then those that didn‚Äôt pay for their kids are being rewarded. How do you make it fair to those families that saved up and paid for their kids‚Äô tuition? Not to mention those kids that worked to pay for their own tuition?  In my opinion, a simpler and fairer option would be to give a sum of money as credit to be used towards education, such as $50K. You can use it against student loans or you can use it against your education or towards that of your kids.
If he promises to pay off student loans I'm all aboard the Biden train. I pay about $1,200 a month for my and my wife's student loans. We can afford to pay that, thankfully, but I know most couldn't. I also know that if I didn't have to we'd be putting most of it back into the economy. The stimulus from me and my peers doing that would be immense.
Sanders just opened four field offices in PA, which doesn't vote for six weeks.  Everyone saying he's going to drop out after the debate or after Tuesday's votes is fooling themselves. He stayed in for 3-4 months past viability in 2016. He's setting up to do the same thing in 2020. He doesn't care about the Democratic party or about stopping Trump. I'm half convinced he wants Biden to lose so he can "told you so" everybody like 2016, completely ignore that he contributed to the defeat, and then run again in 2024 at age 82.
>He is in there exactly for compromises like this.   Stop lying! He is in their for his own pride and for his voterbase. If he really wanted to make compromises he would have dropped out and supported Elizabeth Warren once he had a heart attack.
I think it‚Äôs more targeted at Warren than at Bernie.
CFPB anyone?
These are such good pictures to encapsulate what kind of person she is.  This is the person who took notes in two different colors during the impeachment instead of playing with fidget spinners.  It's going to be so awesome to have a president who actually reads and understands issues!!!!
She Built the Table!
What‚Äôs going to be Trump‚Äôs main point in the 2020 election? - The ‚Äústrong‚Äù economy.   Warren is by far the most qualified to debate him on that and explain why the tax cuts and tariffs have been a sham.
She is basically Hermione incarnate.
Hey partner you‚Äôre killing it on the memes. Preciate ya

I loved hearing the description from reporters at the impeachment trial when it was like, ‚ÄúWarren furiously scribbled notes 12 hours in. Republicans drank chocolate milk and traded Pok√©mon cards.‚Äù
Build tables, not walls.
I DEFINITELY believe Democrats need to push hard against the ‚Äústrong economy‚Äù narrative and I agree that Warren is the best to do that.
Interesting that Warren has a plan to recover from this "strong economy"...    [https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/stop-economic-crash](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/stop-economic-crash)

Lots of people have hair that gets lighter as they get older. Her hair was always kind of a sandy blonde so maybe she does dye it but also three people own more wealth than the bottom 50% of Americans.
She led the TARP committee and started the CFPB, did the original research on how health care costs affect working people, but her hair!  SEXISM NOT REAL
When your natural hair color has turned grey/white, going with a blonde shade is a slight color shift that lasts quite a while before it has to be redone, because it's close to the current tone of your natural hair. Dyeing your hair a darker color means that your hair growing out gives you a readily visible strip of gray hair along your part within a few weeks. Because the color change is so obvious and sometimes even makes you look like your hair is thinning, most people who go with a darker color feel the need to do regular maintenance on it, which is time-consuming, often expensive, and involves noxious chemicals.
And make Amazon pay for it!
This should be an official campaign slogan!
Yup, she literally have a plan for everything. I hope we get to see her debate Trump, i bet he‚Äôll come up with a lame excuse and don‚Äôt even show up.
She was quite lovely. I'm always struck by how much she looks my mother did at the same age, although their personalities are somewhat different. Warren was very confident and exuberant in her body language, even as a young woman.
Yeah she‚Äôs hot
Naw that's just weird and offputting.
it just doesn't make sense. why is the CFPB a table? You would assume the images would be about the CFPB so it's obvious wtf the caption is about...but it's just her holding paper....when she was younger than when she started the CFPB. The images have nothing to do with anything. It's so confusing.

Agreed! Let‚Äôs avoid all sexism, implicit or explicit, thank you.
For YOU. I was raised by Europeans who don't think sex is a shameful or undignified topic. Likewise, among the "less evolved" members of our culture (most of us), sex appeal counts.  You can't deny that JFK, Bill Clinton, and Obama got a LOT of electoral mileage out of theirs.  https://www.vogue.com/article/the-kennedy-mystique-in-ten-words
The table is a metaphor.
It‚Äôs just supposed to be her being a badass and working for progress through the ages, representing her life work. Don‚Äôt overthink it.   Regardless, you can join us at The Table. üçΩ
Because the question was "what does she bring to the table".
What do you think sexism is? It's not just wolf-whistling at girls in short skirts.
There is no occasion where being horny on the internet (outside of actual porn) ends well for anyone involved.
Did warren use Oak, Walnut, or do I need to find another candidate?

I was going to ask how the heirs of the Sexual Revolution came to this, and then I found out you're not even a Warren supporter.  You know, I've spent the last few decades boinking second-wave feminists, and they're just not into this uptight butthurt WASPy sexual politics that the Socialists seem into these days. They're confident and chill adults who don't need coddling. Kids these days could learn a lesson from them.

Idiom: ["bring to the table"](https://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/bring+to+the+table.html)
Warren isn't my number one but I'd vote for her in November if she is the nominee. That's beside the point though. It's still creepy. To help you out with an example. A 16 year old girl wearing a bikini is not creepy. An adult compiling picutres of 16 year old girls in bikinis and making a subreddit is creepy. A woman wearing something because she thinks it looks cute is not creepy. Compiling pictures of women you think are cute without their knowledge or permission is creepy.
As an heir to the feminist revolution and someone who understands digital privacy and how difficult it is to navigate those two...it's Warren's choice what to do with her body...not ours. Let's not objectify her physically, let's stick to what she loves the most (besides her family and dog)...facts.
A pine table cannot last two terms. This is Biden all over again. smh

Thank you for the gold! üòä
If you ever attend any event she has, she's available after. She's a senator for four more years and had regular town halls, so there's opportunities.
Oh I rent. üòÇ I would love to own a home around here but that's definitely not happening any time soon
Warren enjoys great support here, but her supporters saw the race coming down to Bernie vs Biden and panicked, voting against the candidate they liked least.   I cant tell you how many times I heard, "I want to vote for Warren, but we have to stop ____."  Bernie's numbers went up a couple points compared to projections. Biden's about doubled.   And now we have the joy of dealing with obnoxious Bernie supporters who never made an attempt to reach out and consider the concerns Warren voters had, who never once asked "how can we earn your vote?" Who come into our spaces jeering at her for losing MA without realizing that the precise reason that happened was because people were panic-voting AGAINST Bernie. Such is the confidence he inspires even among liberals.
Hopefully I'll be in town when she's having them! I live in the South.
She had a plan for that üò¢
The thing that sticks in my mind is the poll that asked "if you could press a button and make someone president who would it be" and Warren won
She still does, and we need to keep pushing so those plans happen.

Can you link it? I'm having trouble finding it.
I‚Äôm...not sure we‚Äôre talking about the same candidate. Elizabeth Warren? The one who wanted to tax the rich 2¬¢/dollar to eliminate student loan debt, pay for universal child care, and open Medicare for all? So someone who wants to own a house like u/Staple_Sauce can afford it?
None of this was in any way convincing.   "Bernie's just better and she attacked him."  Ok. Cool take I guess.
>This is gonna get thrashed  I mean, yeah, because you are saying some weird shit   &#x200B;  > I at least hope that her plans didnt include further gentrifying DC üòá   the fact that you don't know this means you knew nothing about her plans   &#x200B;  >Im a white man so God knows Im not a racist   literally what does this mean   &#x200B;  >but from my perspective alot of warren supporters weren‚Äôt really there for the policy if you get what I mean   If you mean to imply something remarkably sexist about "identity politics", yeah, I get what you mean. But this again shows you have NO idea what her plans were. We supported Elizabeth because of her incredibly progressive plans that were yes, on par with Bernie's. Some weren't as progressive, some were MORE progressive. Their presidencies would've looked fairly similar, except Liz very likely would've been more effective, since she did all of her homework on how to make those policies actually happen. Elizabeth being a woman was like, the 10th thing I liked about her. Her intelligence, wit, strength in holding her ground, grit, personability and thoughtfulness, her desire to make sure she could do anything she was promising, and her integrity all rank higher. This is a woman who said when she had rallies and town hall, she had them shine the lights so she could see the faces of everyone in the audience, because it reminded her of who she was fighting for and helped her speak from her heart.   &#x200B;  >A little too much grit for me  Yeah, I really want someone spineless going up against Trump   &#x200B;  > she attacked bernie i dont even know how many times  She differentiated herself as the progressive candidate who had the plans to get it done. She didn't attack his character. She simply pointed out that she actually had a plan for Medicare for all, and that his supporters crucified her for it. The tussle in January about their conversation in 2018 was not an attack from her campaign. It was a leak likely from the reporters she told about it off the record, who clearly did not understand that bringing it up would only make her look bad. Asking them about it on the debate stage was unfair to both campaigns because 45 seconds is not long enough for either of them to discuss the nuance or issue a clear apology.
>Im a white man... And lets be totally honest, a little too much grit for me  If you would have started with the latter, the former wouldn't have been necessary. It would have been a given.
Warren Suggests Corporate Media Ask Working People, Not Just the Very Rich, About Her Wealth Tax
Breaking: Wealthy people don‚Äôt like wealth tax!   More at 11
The news media will cherry-pick frightened old people to be old and frightened that their taxes will go up.
twitter user mentioned it, the fact that each time a billionaire comes out about warren's plan and gets an individual article about it shows that they have undue influence over news cycle.
Heck yes. I love her consistent focus on the working people.
They ran it by their multi-millionaire CEOs, but it was a non-starter.

Sweet and salty billionaire tears. Mmmm.
Hell yes. You go girl.
Basically every single person you see on cable infotainment for "analysis" is in the top 5% of income and the anchors are all firmly in the top 1% with the highest paid in the top .5% or richer.   They simply can't be impartial about even modest tax increases on upper incomes and while most of them would not be in the top 0.1%  that would potentially pay a wealth tax, many of the primetime anchors and pundits would.  This is also why we see so many "budget" and "financial advice" segments and articles targeting well over the top 10% as if that is normal.
It‚Äôs a good point, but I really don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúcorporate media‚Äù catchphrase. It‚Äôs way too close to Trump and Bernie with ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù
I agree with Warren's point here, but Warren and her campaign don't use this kind of loaded language that the article title uses. Even the clip of Warren and the campaign ad they reference in the article don't mention "Corporate Media."   This is the term Bernie, his campaign and supporters use to disparage the news media. I wish this sub would steer away from demagogic content, just my 2 cents.
Some working class people don‚Äôt like the wealth tax either. It‚Äôs crazy to know how many brainwashed boot lickers their are.
Should murder be illegal? We asked Ted Bundy
Old people who already have medicare and medicaid most likely.
Well fucking hell, not only will my taxes go up, but my car payment's gonna be late, my car insurance floats that grace period like a Disney float on Thanksgiving, the ex continues to tell every girl our son meets I owe her two grand, Homer's still working his dead end nuclear job, Big Macs are no longer big, nor mac     But the billionaires accuse society of nickel and diming 'em?
Yeah, you don't see a five minute segment about it every time the assistant manager of a Denny's forms an opinion about Medicare for All or a wealth tax...

> Basically every single person you see on cable infotainment for "analysis" is in the top 5% of income and the anchors are all firmly in the top 1% with the highest paid in the top .5% or richer.  ....and none of those will ever have enough net worth to trigger the wealth tax on themselves.  While it's going up way more quickly than inflation, the 1% net worth is still only about $10m.  For context, if you take the top 1%, only 0.1% of THEM are anywhere near the wealth tax.  The 99.9th percentile of JUST the top 1% is $43m, still $7 from *STARTING* to trigger a wealth tax (which only covers net worth over $50m).  The number of wealthy people who would ever be affected by the wealth tax is so much lower than the number of people who bitch about it.
It's what it is though. It's rich people being told by even richer people what to say and what they want us to hear. They didn't bring billionaires on to talk about a wealth tax on accident. And I don't recall Bernie using Trump's "fake news" bit. When did he say that?
I see no reason to not disparage colossal media conglomerates who are run by the rich, of the rich, and for the rich. Especially when they're being as brazen about it as they are when discussing a wealth tax.
Eh, corporate media serves corporate interests. Bernie is sometimes reckless with his language, but on this issue like many other ones, he is spot on.
turns out this sub is an echo chamber.  so.....
Some don‚Äôt like the tax because wealth taxes have historical problems and are easier to avoid than a tax on capital gains or a VAT for example.  Sometimes people have a different view than you because they have a greater understanding of the flaws in a proposal than you might.
Pedophilia, good or bad? We talk with Jared Fogle after the break.
Yep, every time an old person says something negative about M4A, my reaction is to propose we put them in the private insurance market and see how they like paying full freight for healthcare without the massive hundreds of billions of dollars that younger people pay every year in taxes to keep them healthy and out of bankruptcy.

Out at a bar last night and saw a group of people having fun and wearing Warren shirts after her announcement. They were proud to support her even if she wasn‚Äôt going to be the winner.

Thank you so much for all of your hard work. <3
Thank you for all of your hard work. Elizabeth was the clear choice, and I can't believe more people didn't see that.
Thanks, guys! Good work! You should be proud of yourselves.
I listened to her interview with Rachael Maddow on the drive to work and sobbed the whole way. Like a friend said, ‚Äúif even Elizabeth fxxking Warren can‚Äôt beat this misogyny, where is the hope for the rest of us?‚Äù All of a sudden every microaggression, every mansplaining session and every instance of self doubt when I wasn‚Äôt sure if I deserved the slight came rushing back. What matters is not who she endorses, but who is smart enough to implement her ideas. She has established herself as the thought leader on the left, even if they won‚Äôt give her the actual power. We must persist.
My wife was a Steyer staffer, and it sucked when he closed his campaign.  And for her, she knew it was coming.  But the true believers in his office.... It sucked.  All my love to all the Warren staff.
Thank you for your hard work. I had to bring my two year old to knock on doors, and the organizer was nice as pie and supportive as can be with the extra toddler help. I'm so sad Elizabeth Warren has stepped out of the race, and I know that my grief is carried by more than just myself.
We love you Warren & Warren Staff!   You did a great job and we grieve with you.  We wish you all the best and know you will do great things.   But right now, do what you must, and then take some time for yourselves: you've earned it.
Also, if you're a monthly donor, consider keeping it active if you can afford it. Campaigns have debt, staff to pay, financial obligations to meet
Someday some of us will be working on your campaigns
Best wishes to you all, hopefully things work out for the best and we have good reason to celebrate on election eve.
Thank you all so much! I was so looking forward to voting for her in 2 weeks. Senator Warren remains a powerhouse and I‚Äôll support her in anything she decides to do.
And we support you!
Elizabeth, I voted for you in Virginia on Tuesday! Proud of your honesty though. You will be ok. You are a resilient lady!
We ALL love you!!!!  Elizabeth is my favorite US politician of all time.  And Bailey has become my favorite doggo. I hear he's a very good boy.  PS, My billionaire tears mug will be prominently displayed and used for indefinite years to come.
üíóüíóüíóüíó‚úä  Take care and hope to see you girls round the corner up to no ladylike stuff, this isn't over, is probably just the beginning üòâ.  Whatever happens next, I can't wait to see what you ppl will do, what paths you will open...
I have to admit, my energy has been completely sapped since Super Tuesday. At this point of the race I already felt like her opportunity passed her by, but I never expected this result to impact me like this. It feels almost as bad as the day Trump won. This really makes me lose a lot of faith in the Democratic Party heading into 2020. I‚Äôm not sure at certain moments whether to feel angry or just depressed.
I had an appointment right next to what I realized was the Warren San Francisco HQ. As I walked by, I noticed 2 young ladies reclining on a tarp on the floor with their laptops in one of those quintessentially SF Victorian-era storefronts. I stopped and tapped on the glass as unintrusively as I could and gave them a double thumbs up (not really knowing how else to show my support through the plate-glass window). One of the gals graciously came to the door and let me in, offering me signs and other campaign detritus. It was so striking to see these tangibly shell-shocked women in their hastily disassembled former home. One said, specifically, that more than anything she was angry, to which I assured her that the vast majority of Warren supporters were. Aware that anything this stranger off the street said would ring hollow at best, I kept my visit short. I also was holding back tears, myself, the entire time‚Äîthey have their unique kind of grief and don't deserve to have it imposed upon by mine.   [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESeETH7U8AAVMBV?format=jpg&name=large](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ESeETH7U8AAVMBV?format=jpg&name=large) Snap from the visit says "Boo Patriarchy :(" on a whiteboard. That's Warren-campaign-ese for "Fuck the Patriarchy".     edit: pressed enter too soon
I ultimately decided in the booth for Biden  I‚Äôll just say losing sucks, especially for someone you really truly believe in, I‚Äôve been there personally, it‚Äôs hard to shake. Take all the time needed before getting back in the fight

Out of curiosity, would you say you're a... Skeptical Liberal?
Yes! I‚Äôm still donating because I believe in Elizabeth and her campaign in doing the right thing.
Give it a break, friend.   I‚Äôm also a Bernie supporter, but you have to let the Warren crowd grieve. They just had their hearts ripped out of them, and the last thing they need is someone from a different camp telling them who they should support now. It just comes off as insincere.   Do I want all Warren supporters to come to Bernie? Of course. But you have to understand that Warren supporters make up a broad coalition, and they will ultimately be dispersed based on their own political preferences, and not by what someone on Reddit tells them they should do. The best thing we can do is be supportive, and conduct ourselves in the highest manner as we would want others to do for us.

Thank you for telling me what I need to do instead of even considering that you should ask what I want to do. It definitely shows that you respect me as a voter that you just expect something from me.  But then again, the times I feel like a Sanders supporter respects me voting for someone else are far and few between, so why should you be anything but representative of the majority.

True enough.
Warren responds to "Wall Street Democratic donors": I'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.

Nevertheless she persisted.
!warrenplanbot Show me the wealth tax!
Wall Street being mad at her is good for her campaign.   Twitter comments are cancer. Don't bother reading them.
When you actually scare the establishment, you know you are doing something right.
GO LIZ!
Every time Wall Street talks about her she uses it against them. I almost wonder if they actually do want her to win.
The fact that they're willing to back a man who separates and throws kids in cages shows all I need to know about what they really stand for. Good for Warren for not backing down.
Ilhan Omar also retweeted the story: https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1177310856226279424
Why is it so scary that she changed position, like I'm a human that used to be racist and homophobic.  I'm not anymore.  I guess in the internet age we can't change (sorry I've been reading a lot of the "Bernie bro" propaganda). Can we not grow and change as people?  What I'm trying to say is good for her, she's the candidate I will vote for.
She couldn't by a better endorsement!

does CNBC want her to win? cause lol their stories are def helping

She is taking BIG money in the primary through a loophole. This was discovered late last week :(
[removed]
Here's the thing with this. If she's telling them to kick rocks, then why are they giving her money?
She's too smart for these kind of petty threats, she's knows that she doesn't need their money.  [538 did a great article on money in politics](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/) and the bottom line is that *money doesn't buy elections*.  Also, she is one of the few politicians that can raise most of their funding from small dollar donations. She'll have more than enough in the general election. So these cowards are trying to scare primary voters away now because they know they're not going to have any influence any more.
Nevertheless persisted for their money in the general lol
Senator Warren has a plan for that!  She's proposing something brand new - a tax on the wealth of the richest Americans. Her Ultra-Millionaire Tax asks the richest 0.1% of Americans to pay their fair share, raising nearly $3 trillion that we can use to rebuild the middle class.

While I love many of her plans and policies this is the one that is very hard to accept.  Historically speaking wealth taxes are not as effective as people would hope for primarily because it is impossible to determine the value of things like art, jewelry, wine collections and other forms of wealth that do not generate tax reports unless you are auditing the wealthy every year.  Auditing people with no suspicion is harassment and it can be very expensive.  Wealth taxes sound great on the surface but they aren‚Äôt as effective as one hopes.
It‚Äôs not twitter. It‚Äôs CNBC
With her understanding of Finance and Economics, she is **absolutely** the biggest threat to them. She can actually read and understand the regulations, not many politicians can do that.
Yea, you can't support Trump for one reason and pretend like it doesn't make you a monster for enabling all the other dangerous shit the guy could be capable of.

> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need _Wall Street_ money to compete‚Äù  FTFY
Do you have a valid source for this claim?
And why not??
They‚Äôre not?
They aren't lol
So I have a question. I keep seeing Bernie supporters pushing this narrative that Warren is somehow a centrist, or a corporate shill, a closet Republican, whatever. And of course it isn't all of you, but it's a sizable and outspoken chunk.   What is the benefit of trying to cut down Warren? I get that you're passionate about Bernie, and that's great! He's a solid candidate. I would love to vote for him in the GE. But because others think Warren is a better candidate doesn't make it an attack on Bernie. There's very little, if any, attacks on Bernie on the Warren sub. Probably because we realise that Bernie is a similar candidate who ticks a lot of the same boxes for us, and probably also because we recognize that if Warren takes the nomination she will need Bernie supporters. Why aren't Bernie supporters trying to bring us on board as well?
Then why is she changing her fundraising policies in the general election?  Secretary Clinton outspent Trump, what?  2-to-1?  3-to-1?  How is not accepting donations from bad economic actors "unilateral disarmament", and how is her primary campaign any cleaner if she intends to take their money when she wins the nomination?  I'm a supporter and a donor, but her stated position on fundraising in the general leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
I'm gonna piss myself so hard laughing if Bernie gets the nomination and holds donor meetings because he never swore that off.
Good bot.
I'm fine auditing the wealthy every year. If that's the price they pay for their 50mil and up lifestyles, I'm sure they'll be fine.   You're really exaggerating the difficulty of assessing wealth too. The vast majority of assets the United States' wealthy have are tied up in investments, which being closely tied to the open market are easy to put a value on. GAAP accounting also only has you evaluate rare specialty goods (your art and wine collections and what have you) at their last sale price, not proposed current market value. There's some tricky stuff, but the Warren plan includes an assumption of 15 percent of applicable tax revenue being missed, so it's not like she isn't accounting for it.   It's also not harassment for the IRS to do its damn job.
>Historically speaking wealth taxes are not as effective as people would hope for primarily because it is impossible to determine the value of things like art, jewelry, wine collections and other forms of wealth that do not generate tax reports unless you are auditing the wealthy every year.  Auditing people with no suspicion is harassment and it can be very expensive.  ~~Literally none of this is correct.~~ This isn't correct. And the part about "forms of wealth that do not generate tax reports" is a great example of putting the cart before the horse! Things only "generate tax reports" *because we tax them*, not the other way around.  Edit: To expound and cut out some needlessly aggressive phrasing (it's early, sue me).  Wealth taxes have indeed "failed" in Europe, where they were very popular in the 90's. But the cause had very little to do with any difficulty in appraising the value of property ‚Äî in fact, we already do quite well with this; we appraise real property and tax it every year. Rather, there were a couple other confounding factors that made Europe's wealth taxes ineffective:  1. They had a very low threshold. The taxes started in a range that we would consider upper-middle class, meaning that small businesses and other marginally well-off populations felt the crunch. 2. They had narrow bases. Essentially, the opposite of what you've said was true ‚Äî they didn't fail because it was to hard to appraise things like art, they failed because they didn't appraise things like art *at all*. So, families who could easily move their wealth into exempt categories simply did so, and others with hard-to-transfer assets got shafted. 3. EU agreements make it very easy for most Europeans to resettle internationally. So, if desired, you could just pack up and move to a country with a more amenable tax structure.  Now, the above are all legitimate concerns, and they're precisely what Warren's plan is structured around.   To address (1), the threshold is $50,000,000, with a surtax of 1% at $1,000,000,000. We're safely out of the middle class here.  To address (2), Warren's plan has a *very* broad base for assessment. Again, it won't fail because of art appraisals and the like, it will *succeed* because of them.  To address (3), the US is already in a different position. It is much harder to move abroad and expatriate. But, as an addition, they've put forward a 40% exit tax, and propose more funding toward enforcement of the tax code, with a focus on high-wealth families, to ensure a minimal avoidance rate and tough prosecutions for tax evasion.
Funny my town seems to have no problem implementing their wealth tax (Property tax) on me.  Sure, for a while my house was undervalued due to the housing market but still they were collecting something.   I get total wealth is more difficult than evaluating a single house but while it may not work perfectly that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it.  We could start by looking at what they paid for said art, jewelry etc.
I hate the wealth tax because it's a feel good policy which would encourage our unpatriotic ultra wealthy to finally bite the bullet, become not Americans and pay a one time fat exit tax. They can still indirectly profit from the USA like their European friends.  Having to dissolve assets to keep paying your tax bills is a great way to reduce the value of those assets.   A wealth tax would encourage people to change the makeup of their assets. It may be better to hold financial instruments instead of property.   The ramifications of a persistent wealth tax have me sweating and I'm nowhere near wealthy enough to be affected by it.   I think a one time wealth tax is best because one big shakeup though controversial, since there would be fear of it occurring again on convenience, wouldn't have substantially negative ramifications.
The link in OP's post is Warren's Twitter account. That's the location of the cancerous comments.
Totally agree!  Additional, she can take those big, complicated ideas and explain them to everyone without sounding condescending.
The fact she can and willing to just read and use her brain scares them. LoL I wonder to date what % of house and senate actually read the Muller report.

There was an article in the NYT last week about it. She did big money fundraisers for her Senate campaign and transferred 10 million dollars of that money to her primary campaign. She also says that her pledge to not to bug money fundraisers is only for the primary. I'm a big fan of Liz but I have to say it's not a good look for her, and in fact is deeply concerning.
These rich people didn't get rich by being generous. Why would they give it to her? It defies logic.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html
There's an effort to drive a wedge between Warren and Bernie supporters. We're on the same team.
[deleted]
People aren't passionate about Bernie, they're passionate about the ideology behind him. Does Warren's policies sound better than any Democrat of the last 38 years. Yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean her policies are what we need.   Her meeting Clinton doesn't bode well and shouldn't. If you're to be progressive, why are you clinging to the Clinton's, the embodiment of the kind of Democrat that needs to retire.   Her desire to maintain are capitalist system while promising all the other things don't correlate. The system itself if has inherit mechanisms to create massive systems of inequality, corruption and concentration of power. These would be short lived. Aside from economics, capitalism is destroying the planet. If we are to survive we must dismantle capitalism.   The mistakes of the past seem evident in Warren. Things she says ring if '08 Obama. Obama was a turncoat to say the least. And she rings of Hillary too. Not just by some of her leans towards center, but in the fact that her support, up to now, sees to be the same niche demographic of Hillary. She only speaks to older educated, wealthy white liberals. That's not going to cut it. This could change but it's cause for concern.   The fact that the corporate media is gravitating to her raises a large red flag as well. Again, this rings of Hillary's "I have two policies, public and private".   I'm not saying she's Hillary. But when you combine her Obama like tendencies and cozying up to Hillary. Another two-faced Obama neoliberal would be fatal.   The bottom line is we need to transition away from capitalism and Bernie is the best option. He's the only one who has brought up actual social class in a true sense, since LBJ.  So, if you like progressive policy, why are you choosing the lighter of the two options?
 Because running in the general will be more expensive than the primary.  We can expect there to be a decent chance of a recall vote in more than one state and that can be very expensive.  She will need a sizable war chest to make it through 2020.

Auditing people every year in absence of evidence of any kind of wrongdoing is harassment.  In addition audits can take years to complete so doing this would absolutely cause a backlog of work for the IRS and prevent them from pursuing those who are committing real crimes.
The wealthy will simply shift investment to things that cannot be tracked.  This policy has substantial problems.
Property taxes are extremely easy to implement.  Getting to the bottom of exactly how much wealth someone has is very different.
Wealth taxes have been attempted in other nations and they have by and large been failures.  What Warren needs to do is explain why this time it will be different
Read up on the CFPB, it is a really great organization that she has set up that has already hurt the most terrible parts of the consumer financial markets and it will do a ton more as soon as Trump is out of office.  She has already proven what she can do, and has already done.

So she didn‚Äôt actually go back on her word vis a vis this campaign.  I would be surprised if many here were not aware that she used her leftover campaign funds for this campaign.  I was thinking it was something new or something that was as bad as you are making it seem.
This is super old news.  Anyone trying to play it off as a breaking news discovery is lying.  Neither of these things are surprises or secrets.
Because they see the system is broken and they trust her to fix it.
Have you seen her top donors? It's mainly universities.     Show me her biggest donation from a regular corporation.
Yes we are. There's a reason why Bernie and Warren refuse to attack each other - the movement they both champion is too important to fall to squabbling.
Yeah, but the effort is coming directly out of the Bernie campaign from people like Sirota
I think you underestimate tribalism in this hypothetical.
>Her desire to maintain are capitalist system while promising all the other things don't correlate  Sanders wants to maintain a capitalist system, too. He never calls for the abolition of capitalism, and his policies are predicated upon the existence of a thriving private sector.  &#x200B;  >her support, up to now, sees to be the same niche demographic of Hillary.  A lot of us were with Sanders in 2016. The largest number of Hillary supporters are with Biden now, and Warren is split about 50/50 with people who backed Sanders last time and people who backed Hillary. [source](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forget-lanes-the-democratic-primary-is-a-whole-freaking-transit-system/)  >She only speaks to older educated, wealthy white liberals.  No.   [https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3641](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3641)  Quinnipiac poll on whether you would be ‚Äúexcited‚Äù if one of the 2020 Dems became the nominee:   Black voters: Biden 70%, Warren 68%, Sanders 63%   White Democrats w/o college degree: Warren 69%, Biden 54%, Sanders 52%
But none of that is evident. You're vastly overreaching there, and provide no evidence for it. And if you were truly passionate about the ideology behind Bernie, why wouldnt you be happy to see another candidate supporting many of the same policies? M4A, wealth tax, anti-corruption bill, a climate bill, expanding social security...  I could go on.  Fact is, Warren has been in the Senate for a relatively short amount of time. In that time, during unprecedented GOP obstructionism, she helped found and lead the CFPB, getting back literally billions for US citizens from greedy corporations. She attacked TARP for helping the banks instead of the people who actually needed that help. And more and more wealthy Wall Street donors are getting scared she might actually win this thing.   I just don't get why so many Bernie supporters are so happy to undermine her as a candidate. Why would you want to attack a candidate who agrees with the vast majority of your own policies, and certainly much more than any other candidate out there?  Like I say, if Bernie is going to win, he needs Warren's supporters. Do you think attacking Warren herself as a two-faced liar will help convince her supporters to come to Bernie? You have to realise your rhetoric is divisive, and is doing the work of the GOP far better than they ever could.
> Her meeting Clinton doesn't bode well and shouldn't.  Why? What did they talk about?
How much more expensive?  And, honestly, why?  As stated before, Senator Clinton outraised/spent Trump 2-to-1.  She lost the general.  All the money in the world will not get Michiganders and Wisconsinites to come out if they believe that she is not in their corner, and the easiest way to prove that she **is** in their corner is by not taking the money of problematic actors.  IMHO, the success of Bernie Sanders in 2016 was not, necessarily, his progressive policy stances.  It was his calling out of a corrupt system, and, through popular fundraising, his attempt to circumvent the corruptive influence of that money.  Senator Warren has a fantastic fundraising policy, currently.  She's even side-eyeing the unions, which, while I'm super pro-labor, we have to admit have grown some large, unwieldy, and corrupt bureaucracies!  How does that actually mean anything if she is publicly stating a timeline which includes eventually taking that money.  Money that she claims is corrupting the policies of her competitors in the primary, and that that's the reason she should be our candidate.  Sour mouth taste remains!
Yeah and I'd like to imagine greedy capitalists can read writing on the wall. They know what the economy needs is ultimately their need. But they can't bring themselves to be first movers for the needed changes. Not without a real threat to their old way of life. More Trump would keep that going but doom them to crash hard. They know they need to remove some of their perverse incentives.   They need government regulation like a kid needs vaccines.
Who said she is a corporatist?  Certainly not me in my comment.  Money is a corrupting influence, and everybody knows it, including Senator Warren.  That's the reason she is not taking this money and holding these fundraisers in the primary.  What I don't understand is, how that money suddenly becomes less problematic in the general election?  If she is above reproach(which she may very well be) then why not start taking that money now?  Because she knows it looks bad?  Because she knows it was a particularly popular stance for Senator Sanders in the 2016 primary, as he launched his campaign with a statement on the corrosive influence of modern fundraising within the party?  In the primary, she has, hands down, the best stance on fundraising of any candidate in the primary.  She's not even taking large union money, and her insistence that her ideas and smart campaigning are enough to pull her through the primary is a big part of what makes her my preferred candidate.  It does not make sense to me to celebrate this stance if even Senator Warren does not believe that you can win elections without taking money from unsavory(and in the age of climate and income inequality crises, downright dangerous) actors.  How can you be critical of people that are taking this money now, when everybody knows that you'll take that same money the moment you've secured the nomination?  It's an optics problem at best, and something that she has not adequately addressed.
She also proposes more funding for the IRS (paid with some of the revenue from this tax) so they are more able to handle the increased job demands.
Let's fund the IRS more! It's criminally underfunded anyway. And has one of the best returns on funding to any government agency.   Auditing doesn't require evidence of wrongdoing. That would be like closing the stable door after the horses are gone. And calling it harassment is really silly. The wealthy disproportionately benefit from our society - if we make them take some time to ensure they're playing fair, it's the least they can do.
Saying that without any empirical backup is kinda pointless. I've given you a number of reasons why this is an incorrect take. You can take them or leave them, but simply repeating "this policy has substantial problems" will not suddenly make you right, and creating some faux-boogeyman of "un-trackable assets" is bad reasoning! Let's try and stick with the numbers. [Here are Warren's numbers](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/saez-zucman-wealthtax-warren.pdf) (pdf):  >**Tax avoidance/evasion**: recent research shows that the extent of wealth tax evasion/avoidance depends crucially on loopholes and enforcement. The proposed wealth tax has a comprehensive base with no loopholes and is well enforced through a combination of systematic third party reporting and audits. Therefore, the avoidance/evasion response is likely to be small. To be on the conservative side, we assume that households subject to the wealth tax are able to reduce their reported net worth by 15% through a combination of tax evasion and tax avoidance. This is a large response in light of existing estimates.  Note here that *all* of the work that Warren's team is putting into this assumes this 15% avoidance rate. They aren't claiming to be perfect, and trying to make the perfect the enemy of the good is just bad. This is *good* policy.  And [here is a good summary of the findings of these same economists who are subject-matter experts](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/estimating-the-economic-impact-of-a-wealth-tax/):  >Critics cite three reasons to oppose a wealth tax.¬† The first reason is that wealth taxes have failed in Europe. Indeed, eight of the twelve European countries with a wealth tax in 1990 had abandoned them by 2019.¬† Saez and Zucman argue that the wealth tax repeals in Europe were the result of poor policy choices. For example, European wealth taxes were levied on households with little cash but substantial illiquid wealth due to low exemption thresholds. To avoid this problem, Saez and Zucman advocate for a high exemption threshold. The authors note that the exemption threshold in Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs wealth tax proposal‚Äîwhich is set at $50 million‚Äîis 50 times higher than the typical European wealth tax.   >   >The second potential problem with a wealth tax is tax evasion. Saez and Zucman note that although Europe did a poor job preventing offshore evasion, the passage of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) puts the U.S. in a better position to combat this problem. Saez and Zucman also recommend requiring third parties‚Äîlike financial institutions‚Äîto report wealth balances to the IRS. This third-party requirement would reduce reliance on household self-reporting.   >   >The final argument against a wealth tax are the potential negative economic impacts, such as a reduction in the capital stock or a decrease in innovation. Saez and Zucman show that a wealth tax with a $50 million threshold would apply to only about 10 percent of the total household wealth stock. They argue that increased savings from the rest of the population (as the result of decreased inequality) and the government could potentially offset any reduction in the capital stock. In terms of the effects on innovation, Saez and Zucman reason that most innovation is produced by young, not wealthy individuals (the wealthy tend to be much older than average), who would not be impacted by a high-exemption wealth tax. Moreover, Saez and Zucman argue that established businesses spend resources protecting their dominant market positions which reduces innovation. As a result, a wealth tax that only collects taxes from established business owners could increase competition and thus innovation.  Note that that second paragraph actually comes into play with [Warren's trade plan](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/trade-on-our-terms-ad861879feca):  >I am establishing a set of standards countries must meet as a precondition for any trade agreement with America. And I will renegotiate any agreements we have to ensure that our existing trade partners meet those standards as well.   >   >My preconditions are that a country must:   >   >\- Recognize and enforce the core labor rights of the International Labour Organization, like collective bargaining and the elimination of child labor.   >   >\- Uphold internationally recognized human rights, as reported in the Department of State‚Äôs Country Reports on Human Rights, including the rights of indigenous people, migrant workers, and other vulnerable groups.   >   >\- Recognize and enforce religious freedom as reported in the State Department‚Äôs Country Reports.   >   >\- Comply with minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.   >   >\- Be a party to the Paris Climate agreement and have a national plan that has been independently verified to put the country on track to reduce its emissions consistent with the long-term emissions goals in that agreement.   >   >\- Eliminate all domestic fossil fuel subsidies.   >   >\- Ratify the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.   >   >***- Comply with any tax treaty they have with the United States and participate in the*** ***OECD‚Äôs Base Erosion and Profit Shifting*** ***project to combat tax evasion and avoidance.***   >   >\- Not appear on the Department of Treasury monitoring list of countries that merit attention for their currency practices.
Then you aggressively prosecute the first person to do this and put them in jail, I don't care if the government spends .5 billion on the one prosecution it will pay dividends by setting an example so others don't try to cheat.  Taxes are NOT stealing from people, breaking the law to avoid taxes is stealing from everybody and should be a jail able offense.     In this country we shame the poor for needing assistance and cheer the rich for avoiding to pay us back for everything the country enabled them to gain.  It is disgusting and I think Warren's message is exactly what the country needs.
Anytime you buy something you establish the value of that thing.  Yes values change and it adds complexity but to imply that taxing ownership somehow means you have to outlaw ownership is stupid.  Harder doesn't mean impossible.   It is hard to tax anyone with enough money to hire people who's job it is to help them avoid taxes, by your logic we should just give up taxing Billionaires.  Send enough billionaires to jail for cheating and the others will start being a bit more cooperative, it would be expensive but the ROI would be well worth it.
There's no reason to think it would be different. This looks like she coopted Bernie's idea to show she's not shy about aggressive taxes.  Though it seems like a wealth tax applied over a known timeframe would energize short term investment.

Well, to me, the thing that I really don't like is how she's making it seem like she's saying no to the big money as a political optics thing for the primaries and then will go right back to soliciting that money in the general. It's not a good look and I don't really understand why she's doing that. Having more money isn't necessarily better (Hillary showed us that), and I think she'd have a lot more to gain by firmly holding the high ground on this one.
But it can't be. It's functioning as it should. There's a small faction of Wall St people who want another FDR because they're smart enough to understand that social policies are  needed for capitalism to survive. Capitalism will be responsible for global cataclysm. This was what the 1920's did to the 30's. Massive inequality. What FDR did helped, but it took a World War where the US factories we're unscathed for the economy to rebound. Slumped right back down not 20 years later. We cannot consume our way out of the problems capitalism has created. We have to move on, or else nature will force is to. There is no option.
> It's mainly universities.  Harvard is her top University, [which has become more hedge fund than school](https://www.thenation.com/article/universities-are-becoming-billion-dollar-hedge-funds-with-schools-attached/). MIT is 2nd... same situation. I fail to find that to be a reason to support her.
NOT Sirota, but other people on Bernie's staff. Honestly, the staff attacks are all pretty mild, and just come across as whining. lol   The really gross stuff is just from internet randos. Some could be rightwing plants for all we know.

> Sanders wants to maintain a capitalist system, too. He never calls for the abolition of capitalism, and his policies are predicated upon the existence of a thriving private sector.  I'm well aware of this, however... what other viable chance does communism have if not a slow cultural progression towards it?  This was Lenin, Stalin and Mao's major, catastrophic mistakes.  Democratic socialism isn't socialism at all.  Whenever I hear someone call Bernie a "socialist" I ask them to point to a time were he called for democratizing the workplace.  However, he does show up for a lot of union rallies, which I like. He's also called for an abolition of billionaires.  That speaks to me as a Hegelian-communist. Could I vote for a 3rd Party socialist.  Sure, that would be ideal.  But if that's ever to be a viable option in my lifetime, there needs to be gradual cultural ideological progress.  As someone who has felt this what for so long... to see a Presidential candidate actually talking about social class, and true institutionalized racism, sexism, corporate media propaganda, etc. in an authentic way.  I have to throw my support to him (or her).    [According to what I've read, Sanders does better with less educated, racial minorities and men, whereas Warren it's highly educated white women.](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/sanders-warren-voters-2020-1408548)  Which correlates to [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2016/11/03/daily-202-college-educated-white-women-are-hillary-clinton-s-firewall/581a47c4e9b69b6085905de4/).    The link to your poll have people who identify as "very liberal" choosing Warren.  Any socialist worthy of the label would never identify as a liberal. She also has the highest of those college educated at 37% (78% "very excited).  She also has the highest % is the highest wealth category in both $50-100 and >100K.  That's Hillary's domain. In age she's consistent across the board where youth support Bernie and old people support Biden.   >A lot of us were with Sanders in 2016.   So why choose her over Bernie now?  I answer people's questions, and I ask this but don't get an answer.
Being critical of a politician is what we need to being doing to all of them. I'm critical of Bernie, he folded on buying into Russiagate for example.   The fear of being critical of politicians just because they're the people you like most is a reason why we're here in the first place.  People tune out and vote their brand. People actually think Obama is a good President because he can sound like a President.  Politics always need to be held accountable. Even if you favor them.   Why does being critical equate to not voting for someone?
Guilt by association.
>Why? What did they talk about?  Think of it for a moment.  You're talking behind closed doors to someone who lost to Trump.  Consider the public's opinion of Clinton.  Even if what you were talking about was "innocent", why pay that high of a price?
It us hard to project because it depends on how many districts or states you have to recount.  It could easily run into tens of millions of dollars.
That doesn‚Äôt change the time factor.  If you audit people every year you will have a backlog forming very quickly.
110% agree we need to fund the IRS more.  Audits are expensive for the person being audited.  If you audit them every year then you are forcing them to retain attorneys/accountants for the audit.  It absolutely is harassment.
Here‚Äôs the IGM forum take on this exact proposal.  Please pay specific attention to the third question as it refers to alternatives:  http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/wealth-taxes  It seems like the economists polled think that it would be difficult to enforce and that other alternatives are likely better choices.  There does seem to be a general agreement that if it was properly enforced the top .1% would see less wealth so the views of the forum do see some potential benefits.
It isn‚Äôt that simple.  How would you legally stop someone from buying a painting or lots of wine at auction?  Your entire idea is already legally impossible.
 >Anytime you buy something you establish the value of that thing.  Yes values change and it adds complexity but to imply that taxing ownership somehow means you have to outlaw ownership is stupid.  Harder doesn't mean impossible.    Things gain and lose value all the time especially in collectables.  If you are assessing someone‚Äôs wealth it needs to be accurate.    You can‚Äôt prevent people from buying collectables as a store of value that is harder to trace as that would involve banning the purchase of those goods in general.  You literally suggested punishing people who did this.  We should tax everyone.  We should only audit some of them and only when their previous returns suggest they aren‚Äôt being honest.

It is extremely difficult to create a new campaign committee when you already have one.  Merely having a second committee, if that is even legal as it would make it harder for the FEC to track donations, would be an easy target for attacks by others.  At least in this case the appearance if problems is a lot more innocent than the alternative.  You are mistaken if you think this is that big of a problem.
Dude...shes FROM Harvard. You wouldn't expect someone who was a professor from a place like Harvard to run for president and the institution to NOT support her? Same with MIT by association. I'm not doubting that they use a lot of financial investments to drive their wealth, I know that's happening, but really? Big Bad Education? That's our big concern today? I'm sorry, I just don't follow.
I'm still waiting on the corporate donor?   Give me the sweet citation sugarpop.

Sure, feel free to point out meaningful differences. Don‚Äôt call her a ‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù or a ‚Äúcorporate shill,‚Äù or write a screed on how your ‚Äúgut feelings‚Äù say that Warren is a traitor like the editor of Current Affairs. That kind of talk only pushes people away from Bernie.

warren is out with eight conditions she argues should be placed on any corporate bailout, including a $15 minimum wage and a three-year ban on dividends or executive bonuses.
I like it. Especially #3, the permanent ban on stock buybacks.
This is part of why I love Sen Warren so much. She understands the game these corporate executives play, "Heads I win. Tails the taxpayers lose." And she's here to call it out, and put a stop to it.  Far too many Democrats are afraid of calling out corruption because we fear it'll make the next election harder. But it just makes us look as facile as Republicans, which turns smart people off of politics entirely, "Why should I care? Both parties are in the pocket of big business anyway?"  Setting these rules of the road if a company wants taxpayer dollars just makes sense. Hell, I know a ton of Republicans who would love this precisely because it shows how serious US taxpayer money is. If airlines need it, they better earn it.
warren for veep
That would be amazing if all these are attached to any corporate bailouts.
I really like the idea of a ban on executive bonuses. I'm not sure about dividends. Lots of retired folks rely on dividends to pay their bills.
Can she run again in 2024? Is primary-ing an incumbent president a thing?
I'm calling my senator tomorrow to try get them to consider backing this plan (also to vote against the [Earn It Act\)](https://www.wired.com/story/earn-it-act-sneak-attack-on-encryption/).
Moot favorite rule is that employees get a permanent seat on the board. Germany does this and they have a much better relationship between labor and capital
Nationalization. No public money without public ownership.  If the taxpayers invest the money to save them, they should see the returns when the airlines bounce back.  Airlines in general are essential public utilities and should be treated as such.  Many countries (including most of Europe) had publicly-owned airlines at one point.
Damn, I wish she was the nominee. I‚Äôll vote for him in the general, but would Biden have the backbone to make these demands?
Yesss! What‚Äôs the best way to help rally support for this?  The stock buyback thing is infuriating.
Pls pls pls pls pls pls! No more fucking buybacks
ELI5? What exactly are stock buybacks?
this is the kind of stuff that had her being THE candidate that Wall Street and friends were afraid of, much more so than Bernie, she doesn't just have ideology she knows this shit and has worked on it directly for most of her life.
Biden needs to pick up her anti-corruption plans.
If she's not going to be President, we kind of need her badly in the Senate.
Unfortunately, the vast majority of stockholders are not individuals, so the ban the on dividends would only negatively affect a small minority of people (and only about half of seniors even own stock), while having a positive effect on a much larger portion of our society (e.g. increasing the likelihood public corporations don't spend irresponsibly) .   That said, federal aid/stimulus for seniors, especially those who might own stock, should absolutely be on the table.
Feels like it should have been two separate points.  Banning CEO bonuses both during and after recieving relief funds makes sense. Not paying dividends while receiving relief funds makes sense, but extending it for 3 years doesn't.  Also #5 is a good blueprint for changing the rules of the game.  Requiring worker representation on the board of any company beyond a certain size should be a core progressive goal.
she'd be younger than everyone still in the race too
Biden has already said hes not running in 2024. Whoever is VP will walk in with the strongest argument for 2024. It needs to be Warren IMO.
She absolutely can, and we‚Äôre gonna need a progressive to kick out Biden. Bernie will be too old by then and likely retiring so the way is open for her to take it on
Basically the company spends money to reaquire stock from the market. They literally buy their own publicly traded stock back.  It generally has the effect of inflating the stock price while generating 0 new value for society, workers .  Execs love it since their compensation often comes from stock so buy backs are an easy way to make more money personally.    The vast majority of the 2017 tax rejiggering that gave corps money went to buybqcls
I was looking at some of the financials for airlines yesterday, and there are some interesting things.  Take [American Airlines](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL/cash-flow?p=AAL) for example:  They ended FY19 with $290M in cash ("Cash at end of period"), but also spent $1.1B in stock buybacks ("Common stock repurchased"), and $178M in divedends.  They have $60B in assets with $25B in debt.  The big number that sticks out is the negative $118M in stockholder's equity for the last two years, which points to them being overvalued and overleveraged for the last two years, even before this.    I'm just ranting, but when you are in a cyclical business, you need cash on hand to weather market cycles, and they overextended themselves to the short term benefit of shareholders.
When the company starts buying their own shares back, making it more private. Upsides include paying out dividends to fewer shareholders, and boosting key metrics like earnings/share because there are fewer shares (useful for masking flat earnings).  Sorry, I know that isn‚Äôt ELI5.
Biden needs to pick her as something in his cabinet.
Noooooo why do people keep saying this?! It keeps getting amplified by bots too.  The Senate is a graveyard for visionaries. You want Liz to have the biggest microphone she can get her hands on and a seat at the main table. Brown would have to step up in the Senate to replace her voice, but he‚Äôs capable of it.   She killed Larry Summers‚Äô lifelong dream of running the Fed from the Senate floor and she never even had to publicly denounce his nomination. Think she wouldn‚Äôt transform the Veep role?
Right I‚Äôd rather see her be majority leader in a flipped senate
Yeah. I love Bernie but if he didn‚Äôt run I think warren would have won. He‚Äôs done a lot to spear head the progressive cause but if he endorsed warren and campaigned for her she could have won. I‚Äôm not faulting anyone for their choices but if I was some player in a video game and these guys were my playable characters that tactic would have won.   For better of for worse the progressives were divided this primary. The good part was the debates. I think having multiple people  in the debates advocating for Medicare for all and going after billionaires made it seem like it‚Äôs a solid position with nuance.  Not just one crazy loner yelling about caring for working class people and going after billionaires and corporations.   The bad is house was divided. I wish wish wish warren ran in 2016. She could have beat Hilary. Imagine if we had warren in the White House instead of trump right now?   I hope Biden picks warren as vp. If his team are aware of the political land scape they must know warren would please most progressives. It‚Äôs well known Bernie states he would refuse vp because they don‚Äôt need two old white men in the house. Picking warren would be very symbolic to the progressives as an olive branch and she would actually get stuff. Everyone is saying we need unity as democrats. Biden picking warren would help that.
IIRC buybacks used to be illegal, or at least considered a bad practice, back in the 70s/80s.
To be fair, thats for short term, for long term it will allow the company in the future to reissue more stock to raise money if it needs to.  It doesnt want to dilute the market.
It still helps, thank you! :)
Secretary of being President instead of him.
How is the VP any better for visionaries? Name one visionary VP who played a substantial role in *altering* the administrations path (well Cheney I suppose but let‚Äôs not model ourselves after him).   The VP is at most an attack dog for the administration, which Liz could do well, but they are an attack dog for the administration‚Äôs goals and policies, not their own. They rightly have to fall in line with the president and not be seen as pulling strings or being contrarian to the president.   I think she should only become VP if she can also become Sec. Treasury. I know there was talk about if she could legally fill both roles.
My understanding was that if she became VP, a Republican would be put in her place since the role is appointed and the MA governor is a member of the GOP. Apparently they don't have a special election process?  Taking the White House means nothing if we don't have Senate seats. Also I believe Biden already told her that she is needed in the Senate.
I like her as veep bc she would be a logical choice as next-in-line democrat and she would clearly have a large influence on policy. I don‚Äôt like her as veep bc she doesn‚Äôt fit with Biden. I could go either way
I know people really want this but it‚Äôs not going to happen. Beyond the seniority issue, we first actually have to win back the senate. As much as I don‚Äôt really trust Biden, I think Warren would actually be able to take on many responses that he doesn‚Äôt have the most up to date views on. As much Warren should be President, I also have no doubt she would transform the role of VP. Finally, let‚Äôs put it this way: we should stop promoting her as VP because we are banking on the (remote) possibility that she would become senate majority leader.
To be fair it's a shell game most of the time.
Amazing
vice president in charge of foreign and domestic policy.
Due to Biden‚Äôs age, a vote for him is potentially a vote for the next 2 presidents. That‚Äôs why I want him to pick warren for VP. then we still get to see liz in office, and 4 years from now she would have the full backing of the party I think.
- if Liz can man≈ìuvre into anything close to Cheney‚Äôs power, but uses it for good, that is the biggest win for progressives they could get other than the Presidency, and as we‚Äôre seeing in this primary, progressives have a long way to go before they get to that point.  - The VP is traditionally seen as nothing but a mouthpiece, yes. Since when has Elizabeth ‚Äònot a career politician‚Äô Warren cared for tradition? I‚Äôd rather at least one progressive in the room with Biden rather than a cabinet of 100% Citigroup picks. Liz has proven history of pulling strings without drawing attention to the string pulling. I think everyone here is massively underestimating what she could do based on the long history of ineffectual men Veeps.   - Biden‚Äôs VP is the automatic frontrunner for 2024. I believe Warren would be a better President than anyone else on the VP list, especially for this moment, so I want her a heartbeat away. Simple calculation!
Saying Cheney was a powerful and visionary VP is a bit like saying Michael Bay is an influential auteur filmmaker: It's completely true, but you still feel dirty acknowledging it.
I think one thing to consider about a Biden admin is that he is only interested in one term. He only real because people wanted him to get Trump out. I think he sees his time as a placeholder to prop up the next candidate. He's already committed to a woman VP and he could use some cred with progressives. The downside to Warren vs Kamala is her demographic.
I mean, this is the woman who created an entire government entity through sheer force of will while not holding any kind of office. If she's named VP, she would absolutely redefine the role.  I can dream...
MA has a special election process.  They also have a Democratic supermajority that can force a Democratic appointment.  I don‚Äôt think Biden wants to pick her either (he wants someone who won‚Äôt challenge him much IMO), but if anything would change that, it‚Äôs a depression.
I don't think she would accept the VP position from Biden, but I can see a world where she does so under the condition that he resign on Jan 22 '21.
[removed]
I mean, let's face facts here. A super healthy 70 year old who runs around like she's twenty-something with an erudite brain and the compassion and empathy of a mission worker who is also completely grounded in reality would have been a better nominee. You and I thought so. Other people were like, "But she can't beat Trump." I'm really sad she won't be President because she SHOULD be President. She's what we need in a moment of crisis like this. But because she's not going to be President, I want her to be where she is most effective.
Removed for Rule 4.  No bust talk.  Vote so RBG can fucking retire if for nothing else.

That‚Äôs awesome.   I can unfortunately say that with so many robocalls, I would almost certainly unknowingly let her call go to voicemail.
Damn, that's amazing!  Too bad you missed the call, but I agree with you having the VM is great too.
This is my dream and nightmare at the same time.

That was a very useful transcription. Also, now I really need to set up my voicemail!
I had a call from Massachusetts the other day and I got all excited. It was just a telemarketer, though. :(
Does she actually call or is it a Robocall?
Good to know she comes from an unknown number. I can ignore all others!
So cool! I have a monthly donation going and every now and then I get the fundraising email that says ‚ÄúElizabeth might call you soon‚Äù and I always get so hopeful! Did the number appear as ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù? I‚Äôd love to know so I can safely ignore the other spam calls.
That‚Äôs so awesome! (Not that you missed the call but that you got one in the first place)
I was actually thinking about this today: I so rarely answer a phone call that isn't in my contacts. Does her number display a name or ID?
I wish she would do an AMA on this subreddit. That would be dope.
Wow! That‚Äôs amazing!
If only the call translation would step up its fuckin game.
This is wholesome as fuck.  Apparently Bob Ross also did this when his regular fan mail stopped writing. Bless both of them üíï

I wonder if her policy of calling supporters has had a measurable effect on robocall pickup rates.
It's been a long time since I've gotten a robocall from an unknown number. Most now use my area code and so many the next three digits too so those are easy to ignore. Anyway, I've seen enough of these that I might actually answer an unknown number right now.
Same, and debt collectors :( my phone is always on do not disturb, so I usually don‚Äôt even see it pop up!
Same
I‚Äôm still awake in bed deciding if it‚Äôs the best or worst thing ever.   I think I‚Äôll listen to it again now.
Same. The part of me that loves warren says heck yes and the socially anxious part of me says heck no
I was just realizing this is how it would go down for me too. And now I'm trying to figure out what I'd do if I was in the middle of a work meeting, and I see "Hi this is Elizabeth Warren" pop up on my call screening voice transcript.
"Go ahead and state why you're calling"- yeeess I love my cold, robot butler!
Actual call. She‚Äôs picking donors at random to call instead of just calling the people who donate thousands.
It‚Äôs her. I wish I could share the recording, she sounds truly disappointed that I didn‚Äôt pick up, and I know it‚Äôs part of these calls, but it‚Äôs super effective.
Go on her FB page, and you'll see a bunch of videos of her actually calling people.

How can I learn more about her teaching days. I would really like to know more. Is there a documentary maybe or an interview she did on that topic?
To quote Elizabeth: "The people from my former life are rising stars in public service, and the people from Donald Trump's former life are rising stars in prison."
I know about Katie Porter, but now I'm curious who the other 2 are.
And that's going on my FB feed. All I'm seeing now is Pete-Pete-Pete. Ugh.  This country needs a Teacher-in-Chief.
LIZ BUILT THE TABLE!
Which 3 out of curiosity?
Even though this is an interesting factoid, it can also explain the distrust most Americans have in our institutions.  Namely, an exclusive social club.   I understand that we like to think of Ivy League law schools as the pinnacle of meritocratic success.  But I‚Äôm concerned of the precedent of having the political class all educated by the same institutions.  The standard of elite people drafting and implementing policy imports a lot of blind spots which have allowed growing wealth, income, and political inequality to alienate more than half the country.
To me this mostly says our representatives are made up of the Ivy League. I am entirely pro higher education. I am anti-Ivy League. If you attended a prep school and have a Dad who was an alum, you have no business representing the interests of the average American.

Anyone know the names of them?  Edit: Katie Porter, John cotton, and joe Kennedy
Katie Porter is, but the other two just took classes with her. In a graduate setting, that‚Äôs kinda different than being her ‚Äústudent‚Äù - that word implies some kind of more deep research mentorship than intended. Anyone who was at HLS for the period of years she taught important giant classes was her ‚Äústudent‚Äù by this metric, and that‚Äôs a crazy general statement in that case.  At least in the academia I‚Äôm a part of, being someone‚Äôs ‚Äústudent‚Äù implies that that person has trusted you enough to allow you to join their research group and that you publish under their mentorship.
And here I thought political memes where not funny
To be fair she taught at Harvard Law School which is basically a politician factory.

Let's get her elected and she school all of them!!!!
I thought he‚Äôs used to teach special ed? They must all be democrats..
This was a really good podcast episode talking about her teaching experience: https://gimletmedia.com/shows/the-cut-on-tuesdays/emh8l6  Also this article that accompanied the podcast: https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/elizabeth-warren-teacher-presidential-candidate.html
Read "A Fighting Chance" It's a memoir and talks about her whole life up to her election to the Senate.
Have you ever seen Legally Blonde? Apparently Elle's first teacher is based on Warren!
LOL
Tom Cotton is one of the other ones.
I LOVE KATIE PORTER.
Katie Porter is also one of her coauthors on her fabulous bankruptcy law textbook: The Law of Debtors and Creditors  FYI
She definitely rocks!
A mighty, sturdy table!

Katie Porter and Tom Cotton are the other two.

True. Especially since many Ivy students are only there because they're legacies -- that is, they got in not because they were the best and brightest, but because their family members went to the school before them.
I mean 3/535 isn‚Äôt exactly a large percentage.
I can't speak to how it works in law but I'm a PhD in clinical psychology and we would say we are the students of the entire faculty who teaches our courses but the mentee, supervisee, or advisee of our PI and direct clinical supervisors.  Obviously the latter is a more important relationship but I've been deeply influenced by a lot of the faculty who have "only" taught my classes.
Taking classes with someone makes you their student. Only to you does student imply some deep relationship. I‚Äôve taken one class from a law professor and I‚Äôve taken multiple classes from the professor, but I was a student of all of them. I was not a student of every professor though. I did not have every contracts professor, just the one. I did not have every Con law professor either. Those were important classes as well.
Removed, trolling.

Scoreee!! Thank you.
Joe Kennedy is the third
Tom is one too? He clearly turned out horribly as one of the rottenly bad apples of the bunch.
ugh. fuck that guy. ive never yelled at a radio louder than when i was listening to his interview with david axelrod.
that video of her questioning about the SNAP form today was amazing.
I think she should head the CFPB if Warren is President.
BIG STRUCTURAL TABLE!!
Pretty cool that unbeknownst to her or anyone that three would eventually become senators.
Thank you. As a huge Elizabeth Warren supporter, I can only imagine she was as good a teacher as she is a leader in the Democratic Party with everything that she is fighting for now. The only ironic thing I find is that she was once a Republican many blue moons ago. It‚Äôs proof that we all grow/adapt over time into who we are meant to be.
I‚Äôm aware.  I don‚Äôt think politics should be the exclusive domain of lawyers.  I know there are a handful of politicians who were in business or medicine, but there needs to be more backgrounds represented in politics that don‚Äôt require advanced professional-degrees.  For instance, although the time period was materially different, and the New Deal wasn‚Äôt with out its faults, the New Deal‚Äôs planners were social workers, accountants, and tradespeople.  These people are not really involved in political decision making anymore.
> Matt Gaetz went to William and Mary  as someone who is really hoping to get into William & Mary Law, this fact always just hurts me
Yeah, this is why I bristle at the labeling of people who took Warren‚Äôs classes as her ‚Äústudents.‚Äù In graduate settings, it‚Äôs more accurate to restrict that description to people who do research under a person‚Äôs mentorship. This would restrict things to Katie Porter.
I think you‚Äôre missing the larger point.  You can dismiss the numbers that 46 members of Congress went to Ivy League schools and say ‚Äúhey that‚Äôs less than ten percent‚Äù.  But you do have to realize that most of the consensus around politicial economy relating to foreign policy and economics are incubated in these institutions and think tanks adjacent to them.    The neoliberal consensus has been good for some people, but disastrous for others.  My main critique is this:  ‚ÄúIn order to advance in these institutions, you have to conform to their orthodoxies.  These orthodoxies are usually pro-market, pro-austerity, pro-intervention.  The people coming out of the institutions end up perpetuating these norms to government policy without pushback because of their so-called genius and expertise.  We need more diverse backgrounds to fully represent the interests of most Americans.‚Äù
It really is. Got me charged up for the election. I'm also recommending "All Your Worth" to younger folks just starting out in life (but it's useful for us older coots as well).
She narrates the audiobook, so that's double-score for me.
I see what you did there
Yep. But even he admits that Warren was a great professor.
Big enough for Big Structural Bailey to sit under!
Well only one of them did. The other two became representatives.
And to be fair, the Republican party of even the 1990s wasn't anything like the quasi-fascist monstrosity it is today. Back then, Newt Gingrich might have seen like a weird and disappointing aberration, not a sign of things to come.
I definitely see what you‚Äôre saying and I agree that we need more diverse backgrounds in Congress. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I think AOC‚Äôs story has been inspiring for a lot of people is that they can see themselves reflected in her.  For me, though, I don‚Äôt think Warren‚Äôs history as a professor should be viewed as being part of an elite social club because she didn‚Äôt come from an elite background. She busted her ass going to non-elite colleges as the daughter of a janitor from Oklahoma to then rise to the level of professor at our country‚Äôs most prestigious university.   I see this as a statement that she achieved what she has like a BOSS and is here to teach those from privileged backgrounds a thing or two.
We ask our doctors to have backgrounds in medicine and our engineers to have backgrounds in engineering. Our lawmakers should have backgrounds on lawmaking. Why shouldn‚Äôt a law degree should be an absolute requirement for political office?  You can have other interests and skills besides the law, and legislators should obviously listen to the concerns and solutions of the academics who have the best handle on the issues society faces (because they have done empirical research on the concerns of your social workers, tradespeople, and accountants), but if someone is going to be writing my laws, they should know how the law works. The qualification for ‚Äúknowing how the law works‚Äù is a JD.
Ugh Matt Gaetz is the worst!!! Best wishes for an acceptance letter coming your way though!!
Fun fact: Elizabeth reads a letter at the end of the audiobook version of "All Your Worth" from a lady in Texas with a full-blown accent! You can hear what her voice might've sounded like had she stayed in Oklahoma with her brothers (who have thicker accents than she does).
Oh wow. I'll try to find that online.
I saw them onstage together at the HLS bicentennial and they actually get on like a house on fire. He talked about her shredding him in a cold call.
That‚Äôs awesome that he would say that but if only he was a better politician the way she was over time.
> .The qualification for ‚Äúknowing how the law works‚Äù is a JD.  This is not really true. Like at all. A JD isn‚Äôt just 3 years of School House Rock‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just a Bill‚Äù.   A masters in public policy would probably be way more beneficial to know how to get things done in government.
If your library has access to Hoopla, you should be able to find it there (that's where I got it).
Also OverDrive (and their app Libby). [https://www.overdrive.com/media/1675780/a-fighting-chance](https://www.overdrive.com/media/1675780/a-fighting-chance)
Oh good to know. I grabbed it on Hoopla because there was no wait (but Libby is a much better app)
DC Public Library has 8 copies in use and 12 (now 13) people waiting. Honestly just thrilled so many people want to hear her story :D
You just love to see it
Finally! This is the Warren I was waiting for--smart, compassionate, and ferocious!
Every other post in this thread starts with ‚ÄúBernie is my first choice but ...‚Äù  Liz is my first choice. She is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump. She has the best and most detailed plans for fixing our broken country. She is the most inspirational. She will be the best president. Vote for her.
Actual footage of Elizabeth Warren during tonight‚Äôs debate:   https://youtu.be/5E2zVpxEKWI
An American Werewolf in London is so good and so is she.
WARREN supporter here. Yes. This is Elizabeth Warren. This is who she is. This is why she is my candidate. I've been loving all her planning, her deep compassion for regular people, her vision for the future, her willingness to learn. But this right here is why I want her for president. She is an absolute beast in the debate forum, just like she is in Senate hearings. She cleaned the floor with Bloomberg, because she's faced off against bigger, meaner assholes than him. She. Is. Not. Afraid. She won't be intimidated by domineering, ridiculous old white men. She will hold them accountable. And she is smart. Make her my president!
Warren was a woman who'd had \*enough.\* You know the look, mom-is-mad-and-you-are-going-to-hear-about-it.
Ya warren fucking dominated. If this is the Warren were gonna get from now on, shes getting that nomination
This post startled me lol
üéµShe's all out of fucks, she's so fierce in Paris She knows we were right, believing for so long She's all out of fucks, she can't be embarrassed She won the debate, 'cause her fight has been lifeloooongüé∂
For the first time in months, i felt giddy watching her. She went scorched earth on Bloomberg and Pete.   I‚Äôm for Bernie, but good golly god hot damn did she get me going.
hey, that's Marshall! \^\_\^
I didn‚Äôt see the debate, what did she do?
MORE ANGRY WARREN DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINS
You put a Billionaire literally next to her and it brings out her best side
She's amazing on the debate stage. I'm glad she ripped Ol Money Bags a new one
This debate was a reminder of exactly why I love Warren. Bernie's still my first choice, but she was absolutely on fire tonight, and I loved every second of it
She did fucking great tonight. Like a few others in here Bernie is still my first choice but she aggressively fought for the right issues tonight.
Bernie supporter here but my god was Warren amazing tonight! I hope her and Bernie will work together to stop the so-called "moderates".   Bloomberg is DONE. After this debate all the money in the world won't give him this nomination, and more than anyone else Warren took him down.
Don't worry, they'll come back to us when the realize Sanders has the big dreams, but Warren has the plans to make those dreams a reality.
I don‚Äôt get people saying that either. Wow warren was great and I loved her ideas and vision and she did great but I‚Äôm still bernie.  Why?  He has no plan just ideas that warren can articulate on.
Unity, competence, vision, passion = First, Second, and Third Choice
Another big thing is that sanders is a fairly decisive figure. He probably won‚Äôt win a majority of the vote at the convention and even with a plurality he probably won‚Äôt be a nominee since 60% of democratic voters really don‚Äôt like him.   Very few voters hate Liz, most are very amenable to her actually. If we want to avoid a Luke warm, milk toast, corporate appeaser nominee, then we need to support someone that the whole coalition can support or at least accept.
I wish I could up-vote this more! I remember this, and could just imagine her with"Look! I've got a mother f***ing plan for that!"
The first referee he smashes legit looks like Trump lol
I think part of the reason we haven't seen this much of this side of her in the debates is that she's been debating with kid gloves on.  Yes she must appear assertive, but at the same time, until Bloomberg, every other person on that stage is also an ally, and potentially the next President if it's not her.  But Bloomberg, the gloves came off.  It's like that scene with Superman fighting Darkseid.    "I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard, always taking constant care not to break something, to break someone. Never allowing myself to lose control even for a moment, or someone could die. But you can take it, can't you, big man? What we have here is a rare opportunity for me to cut loose and show you just how powerful I really am."  https://youtu.be/gQabrSpKcJw
Same same. Bernie is my guy, but hot damn, does Elizabeth kill it with mic drop moments.
Well this was at the start of the debate [https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/02/20/warren-bloomberg-nevada-democratic-nbc-debate-vpx.nbc-news](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/02/20/warren-bloomberg-nevada-democratic-nbc-debate-vpx.nbc-news)
NBC has a montage that's worth the watch. She came out against Bloomberg hard, and pointed out that the last thing Dems want is another billionaire with NDAs to run against Trump. Her going after Bloomberg was definitely the main feature of the night and it was great to see. Edit to add: there was a great moment when Bloomberg was asked about his treatment of women and Warren for to respond first and she summarized his explanation that "he's nice to SOME women" and then she pressed him to specifically number for many ndas are out there and if he's so fine with transparency release them right now. It was fantastic.  She also was very clear what the differences were between her and the other candidates as far as their plans go, she was able to articulate a lot of her plans ( health care, wealth tax, specifics on climate change). They didn't like that much but I thought it was great.
She was glorious.
[removed]
I think they will. They like each other and are very close politically. I don't doubt that if Warren wins Bernie will be a loud supporter, and vice versa.
That's how you know it's a cult.
Man?
If Bernie said anything other than "millionaires and billionaires" I'd vote for him but unfortunately he's a broken record!
I fucking love her
On another topic: why are we still letting people get away with saying something about "taking away the insurance plans they love". Who the FUCK 1. knows who their insurance is through and 2. loves that company? I've never heard someone say "you know, I really love Blue Cross Blue Shield". Doctor, sure. The choices their plan provides, sure. But nothing that is singularly special to their insurance that M4A wouldn't ALSO provide. /endrant     Also, EDub is the real frickin deal. Cannot wait to fill in that bubble.
[removed]
Removed: Civility and rule 4.  This is a warning. That behavior is not acceptable.
Bernie just adding a few wildcards into his stump speeches could do him a lot of good. I get he‚Äôs been fighting the same fight for decades, but maybe just mix it up a little lol.
When you see rule breaking, please use that report button.
[removed]
That's ridiculous. Discussing another candidate's physical viability is a legitimate campaign issue.
Thank you
Removed: Trolling.
And it has to be done with care, compassion, and empathy.   Your comment was completely over the line. The Warning stands. Do not break additional rules.
In Austin yesterday...
Elizabeth was great! I was there with wife and our 8-year old.  A rainbow appeared, just before she came out to speak. An omen!
Texas is flipping Blue in the General Election!
[https://twitter.com/FarrellGabriell/status/1171624552809598988](https://twitter.com/FarrellGabriell/status/1171624552809598988)
I like Warren and Mayor Pete,  I hope they are on a ticket in any order.
Wow - Warren had more people at her Austin event than Trump had at his inauguration
Bernie had a bird. Warren had a double rainbow. Biden had a gaffe.
WARREN RISING!
Warren/Castro bby
INB4 bernies crowds are bigger lol.
Wow she might start pulling is crowd's the size of Bernie's soon.  Edit: I understand how that can come across as snide. I like both candidates and am only wanting to point out that it's interesting that the momentum seems to be swinging towards Warren.
There got to be like 1000 ppl there!
I heard it was a double rainbow.  [https://twitter.com/thomaskaplan/status/1171580616036556800](https://twitter.com/thomaskaplan/status/1171580616036556800)
There have been several polls showing democrats beating Trump in Texas in 2020. Poll: [Poll](https://static.univision.com/especiales/noticias/infografias/2019/encuesta-septiembre/univision_national_texas_poll.pdf)
That‚Äôs my dream ticket. You could flip flop either into either position and it would still be fantastic. Pete and Liz are both very smart people that sensibly cover the left side of the political spectrum. They have different overall policies but I‚Äôm confident in both.
Same, though I also wouldn‚Äôt mind an Abrams VP on the ticket.
Even though I don't believe in God, it's nice to think that it is almost as if God is trying to give us a sign in the right direction =)
You mean a long horse?
I shall be slightly meow:  A group of giraffes is called a tower
It's pretty bad coming into other candidate's subs to stir shit. Is that a hint of desperation I smell?
I didn't think it came across as snide until I tried to imagine it as snide.
Nyet. There were 5000. Try again.
DOUBLE RAINBOW ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE SKYYY
Great pic! From my vantage point near some trees I hadn't noticed the second rainbow. Really was a stunning evening - rain let up, sun was shining from the West through some scattered storm clouds, and we got to hear her compelling message. I actually hadn't heard her full stump speech before. Fantastic communicator. Dare I say, I actually felt hopeful, which has been a rare feeling since 2016. Told my daughter that she may be looking at the next president of the United States.
It absolutely was, I was afraid she‚Äôd get rained out but instead it was a nice backdrop
Damn I've never seen a double rainbow before.  Wish I saw rainbows more often, they're so beautiful.  Life really is magical.
I don‚Äôt have my hopes up, but that would be abso-fucking-lutely amazing.
One of the issues with these types of polls so early out is that they don't pick up a lot of reliable GOP voters who  are 'weighing their options' or are 'unsure about the candidate' but always end up going R the closer election day gets especially as they learn more about the Democratic candidate.
I wouldn‚Äôt be trusting ‚Äúpolls‚Äù after the last election
Warren/Abrams would be a powerhouse ticket.
Bernie pulls the biggest crowds. How is it stirring shit to congratulate Warren on starting to catch up?  Edit: alright, so Warren supporters are petty buttheads. Noted. Wish we could just get along as Bernie and Warren are closer than any other two candidates.
Sorry. There must be like 5000 ppl there! Lol
WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
I believe that if every voter is allowed to exercise their right, and that vote is properly counted, Texas will flip to blue.  But knowing the kind of voter-suppression and other skullduggery the GOP engages in (saw it first hand here in GA) I am cynical about the prospect.
Yeah it probably should be happening, but considering the voter suppression here I wouldn't count on it. Democratic Party would have to put a lot of resources to combat it. There was a story just a couple days ago about how many voting locations have been closed here since the Supreme Court fucked the VRA. Upwards of 200 locations I believe.
[deleted]
I don't think that's true this cycle.  Kamala Harris got 20,000 for her announcement and I don't think Bernie has held anything as large as Warren's Seattle event.  She's about on par with his 2016 crowds of the same time period though.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2019/08/27/the-trailer-do-elizabeth-warren-s-big-crowds-matter/5d63074388e0fa7bb93a872c/  Edit: /u/taste_fart has pointed out that Bernie has pulled 15k and 16k at a couple rallies this cycle, so he has had similarly large crowds.
RuPaul's Drag Con has sent its blessing.
That's not how probability works. With a 90% chance of winning, Hillary won 90 out of 100 simulated elections. Meaning that Trump won 10 out of that 100. If it was a sure thing, they would say "100% chance." We came across one of those instances that defies probability. Let's also not forget that 538 changed that probability to 70/30 after Comey's memo.
That wasn‚Äôt the polls‚Äô fault, though. That was just shitty media narrative (that probably ended up helping Trump win, too).
That's a fair point, it's reasonable to say their models were shit.  However fivethirtyeight (the website Nate Silver runs) did a pretty good job imo.  Their model had Trump with a 36% chance of winning, so roughly 1/3.  A 1/3 chance is a very legitimate and good chance of winning.  In addition fivethirtyeight got the 2012 election 100% correct, they predicted every single state correctly.  So I'd recommend in the 2020 election to look at what Nate Silver and fivethirtyeight are predicting because they have a pretty good track record compared to their competition.
These are odds that analysis give, no human exists without bias, and most analysts didn't/doesn't want Trump to win.  While it is a bit foolish to be taking polls as gospel and treat them as if they are votes being cast right now, which I find much of the punditry does treat them as. It is equally foolish to completely disregard all of them, they are snap shots of where the country is. If it wasn't for bias we would've gotten more reporting about how Trump and Hillary were frighteningly close, way closer than it ever should have been.
I was there in Seattle and it was PACKED.
I get that everyone in this sub will be angered by this probably, but Bernie's crowd sizes have been larger. The article you mention does not even mention his crowd sizes... interesting choice. But this last weekend as an example, Bernie had a crowd of 10k while Warren's was estimated at 5k. This is Denver V Austin, which is not necessarily a fair comparison as Austin is larger, but Denver is maybe more liberal? Idk.
Why would you compare those cities when both crowds were smaller than hers in Seattle?  Was there a rally of his that had more that should have been included?
That would be impressive if crowd size meant anything at all, which it doesn‚Äôt.
I compared these because they were the ones that happened this last weekend. He drew [16k in San Francisco](https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/03/24/bernie-sanders-san-francisco-rally-california-mueller-report/) and [15k in LA](https://heavy.com/news/2019/03/bernie-sanders-los-angeles-rally-turnout-la-crowd/).
No, yeah, you're absolutely right. It doesn't mean anything... Nate Silver wrote a good peice on it [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-let-crowd-sizes-mislead-you/).
And if you weight it by population of the cities, Warren's is more impressive. Anyway, having a dick size measuring contest over crowd size is stupid. Bernie and Warren are just trying to bring in support for progressivism by holding these rallies. They should both be pulling in strong crowds.
Noted!  I've added an edit to my higher up response.
Cool. I am genuinely curious now how their crowd sizes compare on average now‚ÄîI've mostly only heard of Bernie's crowd sizes until now. Does this subreddit keep track of Warren's events and crowd sizes? If you want to see a list of Bernie's events and crowd sizes, one of the moderators at r/SandersForPresident keeps track of them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tsk1ublTJcBtpR0D-NN5iMoTDVwMO_H8Ra4kXCJO_mY).
Cool tracking spreadsheet!    We mostly only note the big ones that make news.  The 12k in St. Paul and then 15k in Seattle were the ones that got people to start noticing them.  A common comment was speculating about how long the selfie line must be (including some people posting to the sub multiple times while waiting in it).  I think the Seattle line was something like 4 hours.  These events are turning into selfie lines with an introductory campaign speech.
Warren is getting a Time Magazine cover.
Yes! And this photo is so perfect!
Finally‚Äî I hope her campaign starts to snowball.   People are such hypocrites. They say they want to vote based on policy and they ignore the only person doing that. It just shows sexism is alive and well.
Agh about time!  Edit: seriously no pun intended!
Here's the related cover story.  http://time.com/longform/elizabeth-warren-2020/
Presidential AF
I love that it covers so much of her personal story and growth. I was a supporter from moment one, but the connection I needed to go canvass enthusiastically came after hearing her story at an appearance in Iowa. She's a real policy nerd, but she's also authentic and accessible.
Sweet !
This is going to hopefully lead to a bump in polls
I‚Äôm buying this issue to keep.
Good title!
She looks presidential :)
I'm glad to see that her campaign is really starting to gain some momentum.
I'm so excited about her picking up steam!
Good!
I love it!
A real one, too!
Good stuff
YAS QUEEN!
Real presidents make fake Time Magazine covers with their picture on them and hang them in the locker rooms of their golf clubs.
[removed]
This! That photo of her is so great!
We've got a fight ahead of us to overcome the silent, pervasive sexism that almost no one can admit to, or even see. It's stunning how pervasive and subtle it is.  If any candidate ever could overcome this, Warren can. The opposition will be fierce and completely un-self aware, and it will, sadly, be from every side of the political spectrum. It's hard to overstate this challenge.
the electability fallacy is self-sustaining: ppl think electability matters so they don‚Äôt vote for women or people of color in primaries, then don‚Äôt vote for them later because they don‚Äôt have a good track record in primaries and chalk it up to ‚Äòelectability‚Äô
> which I am one of, are already mocked for scapegoating sexism. If Obama became president with not only his name but his skin, I don't like floating around "people won't vote  "bUt AnDrEw YaNg!"     I know I shouldn't be ragging on other democrat candidates... but, seriously, Andrew Yang is always the response to "no candidate has policy plans" and he's barely really got any policy.
I'm honestly tired of someone mentioning sexism in every warren post. I know there's truth to it but it's becoming a meme. Her supporters, which I am one of, are already mocked for scapegoating sexism. If Obama became president with not only his name but his skin, I don't like floating around "people won't vote for her because she's a woman." I don't think that holds enough weight for it to be mentioned as much as it has
Snowballs melt under hot lights.
I don't know that it has to do with sexism, per se. Bernie was treated the same way last go around. Was that due to anti-Semitism? Or just anti-progressivism and centrism? I would argue the latter.
It shows that people don‚Äôt like her policies. It has nothing to do with sexism. Stop being a victim. The problem with a candidate giving detailed policy statements is that it gives people something to attack. No platform will please every single voter. That‚Äôs why candidates resist saying anything specific. EW will become the lightening rod in the early debates because she‚Äôs the only one who has presented a debatable position. She will be on the defensive, and that isn‚Äôt a good look for any candidate. Especially one that many people view as a crazy old lady.
I think this is ok for its own post to discuss the article.
This should be stickied in the comments. Thanks!
She needs to talk about her working mom experiences in the debates.  That's the base of the party. It answers the question "Which candidate can I trust will care about and fight for people like me?"
And hers is real! https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-time-magazine-with-trump-on-the-cover-hangs-in-his-golf-clubs-its-fake/2017/06/27/0adf96de-5850-11e7-ba90-f5875b7d1876_story.html
Show me the poll where Trump was winning in May 2015...?
I say play off of it- most people trust their moms, grandmas, to take care of shit and clean up the mess.
You‚Äôre so right.
>overcome the silent, pervasive sexism that almost no one can admit to  There was an odd, very minor anomaly in the last election. When called on the phone on who they would support for President, they did not want to say Trump because they were afraid it would make them look racist and sexist. They lied to pollsters out of embarrassment. Because of the number of candidates in the primary, I don't believe they would lie now. But I would expect a minor group of people to lie in the General election.
I actually have seen these type of comments rarely in this sub, but used as a complaint of Warren supporters in subs of other candidates.
https://slate.com/technology/2014/02/conspiracy-debunked-atlanta-snow-doesnt-melt.html
Bernie wasn‚Äôt exactly banging out policy plans on the campaign trail. He formally introduced his M4A bill in 2017. In 2016 he was mostly slogans.   Aside from the press treatment Bernie and Warren receive, Bernie gathered up enormous amount of grassroots support and funding in a very short time. Bernie‚Äôs magnetism compared to the luke warm appeal of Warren I believe can be attributed to a mixture of sexism and charisma. People like to hear Bernie speak more than they like to hear Warren speak, similarly people like to hear Beto speak more than they like to hear John Kerry speak.     The cynic in me says men automatically have a leg up on women in the charisma department. We‚Äôre fucking monkeys after all. People who are taller and have deeper voices just seem like leaders to us.
I mean if it makes you Bernie folks feel better to deny sexism, I guess that's your prerogative. Sexism and racism just don't seem like factors to you ever, ever ever. Which is sad, since it denies reality.

You forgot "Boys will be boys." Some women hate female candidates as well. This is instilled on their children.
I'm not a Bernie folk. I'm for Warren. Good Lord, you people. Stop being so damn divisive. Just because people don't support a female candidate, doesn't mean they're sexist. That's the same stupid shit Hillary supporters pulled. I didn't support her the primary because I preferred Bernie, but I did in the general, for obvious reasons. Has nothing to do with sex or gender. Fucking virtue signaling doesn't do our cause any good. Sexism exists; I'm well aware. And where the hell do you get the idea that I think racism or sexism doesn't exist?! And why am I even wasting energy responding to such a completely moronic claim?!
Can we not do this? Warren and Bernie both have plans to varying degrees. They are some of the most progressive Senators we have. Let‚Äôs just support them, instead of tearing them down. We need them both.  Edit: Not furthering this convo with more responses.  > /r/ElizabethWarren Rules >  > R4: Dividing Democrats >  > We need to elect and support Democrats. Posts and comments that intend to divide the Democratic party are not allowed.
Not true. He was called the "amendment king" for over a decade and has co sponsored so many bills.
Oh, lol. My bad. That's what I get for going through the whole frontpage in Reddit is Fun. They don't exactly make the months clear.
This is literally a poll showing Trump trailing Jeb Bush. And it‚Äôs from July. Try again.

Editing your post is responding more.   I guess you‚Äôre in the camp that progress is all that matters.  I am not a democratic socialist and a lot of Warren supporters are not. I think you‚Äôre either confused or in the wrong place.   You need to learn the difference between policy debate and personal tear downs friend.   Progress at all costs is not for me. I believe in slow, thoroughly thought out, stable change that will last. That‚Äôs why is critical to have policy plans by experts. Funding doesn‚Äôt come out of thin air.   The reason why liberals are inherently better than Republican Party right now is because we do have internal debates. They just fall in line. Don‚Äôt fall for their bullshit. Internal debates are NOT wrong.
Being able to negotiate is not the same as initiating written policy.   Where are his plans now?
You mean bills? [Here you go.](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/S000033/bills-sponsored/116)   You mean plans? [Here you go](https://berniesanders.com/issues/)
No I‚Äôm not talking about stances, I‚Äôm talking about how he plans to make those things happen. Actual policy plans.
....That's what the bills are for
I don‚Äôt have time to fully reply right now but this is simply not correct.
Elizabeth Warren: "I'm surprised that someone running for the Democratic nomination thinks the economy would be better off if we just let banks be more overtly racist. We need to confront the shameful legacy of discrimination, not lie about it like Mike Bloomberg has done."
Bloomberg's recent polling numbers should disgust everyone. Everyone on the debate stage needs to destroy him, but Elizabeth is in the best position to do it. Bring some of that righteous anger and passion when she grills big bank CEOs and Trump-appointed administrators.
I want to see her body him at every possible opportunity at the debate. I don‚Äôt care if the NYT writes 5 editorials on her strident voice, he needs to be gutted. She‚Äôs opposed to everything he stands for and has to make that blindingly obvious. Her entire reason for running is to end the corruption he embodies.  On that note, I want her to challenge Bernie and Biden and Pete too. No more ‚ÄòAmy and I‚Äô bs either, it makes Amy look viable, though I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôd be any benefit to actively going after her unlike with the others
I'm hoping everyone takes shots at Bloomberg. I absolutely despise how hes gotten where he is in polling.
If these recent tweets are an indication of a more feisty campaign approach from here on out, we're going to be in for a treat at the next debate.  Either that or she'll be dragged through the mud by the media for being "too mean" even though all of her opponents have been 100 times more nasty than her throughout the entirety of their campaigns. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
I love her so much. Why isn't she the common sense candidate for every single person who doesn't like where the country is headed now!
What is she referring to here? I want any fact based arguments I can make against Bloomberg, especially ones centering around race (my family is African American).
"Michael Bloomberg championed the incredibly racist 'stop & frisk' policy."  And if that doesn't get him, this will: "Michael Bloomberg gave Pat Toomey (R-PA) $2 million in campaign contributions in 2016. He is the reason that the Republicans hold a Senate majority, why Kavanaugh and dozens of unqualified federal judges are on the bench, as well as why every horrible bit of Republican legislation became law."
Bloomberg being on the debate stage is Warren's wet dream. No one on stage will be able to destroy him quite as thoroughly as she will
Warren‚Äôs dream would be having Bloomberg on the stage to punch.
Are we allowed to attack Bloomberg on this sub? I don‚Äôt consider him a Democrat and don‚Äôt think he deserves to he protected by the rules.
I just sort of... don't get Bloomberg's deal. I lived in NYC while he was my mayor... but he was a Republican then, and even with Donald Trump as the republican nominee, Bloomberg went out campaigning for Republicans, to help the GOP maintain the majority it abused Merrick Garland with, and enable Donald Trump. So... for him to work so hard to put people into place to enable Trump, and now to come back around and feign surprise at the consequences of his own actions just smacks of disingenuousness.  That said, I think Mr. Bloomberg does deserve to be on that debate stage. His commercials are great, and the only way Americans are going to see  that he's not nearly as great as his advertising is to put him up there.
That';s our girl go get them LIZ
She's right.... but Warren isn't gonna be getting any more support by going after Bloomberg.   The kind of people who like him are very unlikely to back someone like Warren. They like that he's more moderate. Warren is explicitly not moderate.   IMO she'd be much better off going after Bernie. That's where the voters with shared ideology are. It's also the campaign most likely to steal votes from Liz.
It's obvious what Bloomberg's priorities are, he literally said "The healthier the banks are, the healthier our economy will be."   [https://www.businessinsider.sg/bloomberg-on-wall-street-and-donald-trump-2016-10/](https://www.businessinsider.sg/bloomberg-on-wall-street-and-donald-trump-2016-10/)  "In a conversation with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait and Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, he started by describing what he would do if he were running for president. 'I‚Äôd have to defend the banks, which is not a particularly good strategy to get elected in this country today,' the business magnate said. 'But we desperately need a good group of banks that are willing to take risks and make money so they can finance our growth. ‚Ä¶ The healthier the banks are, the healthier our economy will be.'"  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-10-28/michael-bloomberg-and-james-gorman-on-long-term-thinking](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-10-28/michael-bloomberg-and-james-gorman-on-long-term-thinking)
When assessing financial risk, there are factors that are empirically predictive that it is now illegal to utilize as part of the pricing or scoring models. As a result, costs go up for those who are better risks who effectively subsidize others, and companies must take on higher risks who have a higher probability of default, destabilizing the institutions and the overall system. Those are simply factual statements. Whether you find that to be good, bad, or indifferent is a matter of opinion.
I need Bloomberg to have Warren and Sanders on his left and right flanks during the debate. I need both Warren and Sanders to show up each wearing a bib and brandishing a knife and fork.
> Everyone on the debate stage needs to destroy him, but Elizabeth is in the best position to do it. Bring some of that righteous anger and passion when she grills big bank CEOs and Trump-appointed administrators.  She is by far the strongest when it comes to holding Wall Street to account.
[This meme summarizes my feelings](https://imgur.com/a/mZf77iy)
She will need to directly call out the other candidates for their flaws the way Klobuchar does with Pete. Going on the offensive has always been risky for her (ex: wine cave), but at this moment she needs to initiate on their flaws and make herself look like the most competent and qualified candidate on the stage.
I wanna see liz eviscerate her competition like she eviscerates republican lackeys at committee hearings. That's the liz that i love and want as a leader
She is absolutely at her best when going directly at wealthy people. Her rise in the polls earlier in the cycle coincided nicely with her debate sparring with John Delaney.
YESSSSSSSS!!!! Please Liz! Her BEST debate moments (and BEST Senate moments) are when she GRILLS INTO the wealthy! (a la John Delaney and Goldman Sachs CEOs). This next debate is going to be the perfect opportunity for her to bring the fire that has given her public adoration.  Also, while she should totally focus on the horrible politics of Bloomberg in the next debate, I hope she also ties in how his wealth is completely tied to Wall Street, and maybe how it was built off of predatory trading (I don't have exact knowledge of how Bloomberg Terminals and their corresponding technology may have added to the financial crisis, but I am sure there is something there).

Me too, he's gotten there *entirely* through ads, which is why it's about time he's in the debates, that's the only place he can be challenged by anyone else.  No one except possibly Bernie has the campaign cash to take him on via ads, and even then he dwarfs Bernie's available ad money.  I'll be glad when just about everyone on that stage makes him explain his prior policies, how he got in the race, and why he thinks he can win.  He's smart, but the rest have a half dozen (or more) debates under their belt and have been campaigning for a year, they're primed.
According to NH exit polls, 20% of NH voters said Warren was the most negative candidate in the race, putting her at second behind Biden at 30%. I don't know how you can look at this campaign and decide she has been the most negative without misogyny.  I agree with your assessment in a vacuum, but I worry her getting more feisty will just make voters turn away from her for being too negative. Women aren't allowed to be negative. Being feisty makes men "tough" but women "bitchy".
I'd rather see her go down fighting than fade into the background with the silly unity messaging. I hope she comes in guns blazing in the NV debate. She should get into an exchange with every one of the candidates from Bloomberg to Bernie. Make the case why Bloomberg sucks (easy one), take on Biden's bankruptcy fight, Pete's meaningless platitudes and why she would be a far more effective president than Bernie. And please no more of the "Amy and I" stuff.  If she isn't making a hard sell for herself at this point then I won't be surprised if she is already in the single digits by the time Super Tuesday rolls around.
>If these recent tweets are an indication of a more feisty campaign approach from here on out, we're going to be in for a treat at the next debate.  It seems like the other candidates have ignored Bloomberg for the most part.  Hopefully the moderators ignore the dollar signs and do their jobs by asking him tough questions.  If not, Bernie and Liz will be there to eviscerate him
I dont give a fuck what the media thinks. She needs to body slam the competition
I think this: https://apnews.com/8cbb1fafbb4faf01e8d9571363979501
Here's some video of the remarks that she's referring to; https://twitter.com/AnandWrites/status/1227757529859526656?s=20
From a [New York Times fact check](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/us/politics/bloomberg-stop-and-frisk-fact-check.html):  > After Mr. Bloomberg took office, the number of recorded stops [increased sevenfold](https://www.nyclu.org/en/stop-and-frisk-data) to a high of 685,724 in 2011 from 97,296 in 2002, according to data from the Police Department compiled by the New York Civil Liberties Union. In Mr. Bloomberg‚Äôs last year as mayor in 2013, the police recorded 191,851 stops, a decline of about 72 percent from the 2011 peak or an increase of 97 percent from his first year in office. In all these years, more than 80 percent of those stopped were black or Latino.
It was actually 11.7.
A) It's is downright misleading of you to imply that the system is "destabilized" because banks cant discriminate based on race. Risks going up MIGHT lead to higher costs, and even that isn't any guarantee   B) Your reasoning is shortsighted - not backing loans for certain minorities creates a self-fulfilling cycle where people are never able to escape poverty, and never become contributors to the economy   C) The point is that bloomberg was an elected official to represent the people, not the banks
Yeah this is why I don't get people who are pissed they changed the rules to get Bloomberg onto the stage. Without that, he can just firehose this carefully selected and manicured version of himself to the entire country with no rebuttal. This way Warren and Sanders can absolutely tear into him about being a billionaire oligarch buying his way to the nomination.
I swear that I had this exact dream two nights ago.
I love this comment so much
>I need Bloomberg to have Warren and Sanders on his left and right flanks during the debate  Yeah, and no box for him to stand on, so Warren can look down on him when she destroys him.
Vote blue no matter what. Bloomberg would be the biggest "hold my nose" vote though.
Fuck yes, not him, not ever. It's Trump with no opposition party but smarter and more callous. He can't be our nominee.
100% she needs to go on the offence. Yes she‚Äôll get sexist commentary for doing it, but people seem to think only a bulldog can beat Trump. It worked for Amy.   The best way to do it without falling into the wine cave trap is probably by going after their records and being as factual as possible. No metaphor. Voting/legislative records, and then pivot to why she‚Äôs better on that policy.
She should use Bloomberg as a stand in Trump next week. He basically is.
I would love to see all of this. I thought the same about Clinton. She kept a too-carefully-manicured persona and let loose some after her loss and just came across far more fiery and relatable. I don't agree with everything she has said or targeted, of course, but...  I do think Warren would benefit from showing some of that fire. She's been very reserved and I think it is important to be when leveling criticism at other Dem candidates. Criticizing Bloomberg, though, should be gloves off. He's not a Democrat, he's an oligarch.
I really do appreciate the amount of work that goes into making a comment like that. I just don't think this sub is the right place for it. We try and be inviting to every candidate. That is quite pointedly an attack on one.   I think r/politics or other neutral ground subs are a better place for that kind of comment.   good luck out there. But remember, at the end of this nomination process, we will need to come together to go up against Trump. If we wound each other too much right now, we will only hurt ourselves.
Bloomberg is the only candidate I wouldnt vote for.
I get that, but I also think: these 20% are going to think she's the most negative no matter what she does. Might as well kick some ass. I mean, that's what got most of us interested in the first place - she's good at it.
That's an insane poll. She has been the nicest one up there
She doesn‚Äôt have a choice.  She ran a Hufflepuff campaign based on her being by far the most qualified candidate with the best plans trying to avoid the misogyny web, and it failed her. With Bloomberg looming, she can‚Äôt fade into the background. Calm competence isn‚Äôt getting through to voters.
I'm almost 100% that almost all of that 20% comes from Bernie and non-dem voters. Bernie got 26% of the vote in the primary and we all know how a lot of his supporters feel about her. (His supporters loudly booed and cursed and chanted during candidates speeches at the New Hampshire dinner so they are pretty blatant about it) As well as 13% of votes in the NH primary were independents who have no intention of voting for the dem over Trump in the general. Liz got almost no votes in this demo. (Which I see as a good thing)
It‚Äôs all because of the wine cave and the Bernie meeting. She‚Äôs generally been as positive as anyone but she got sucked into those two stories (only once by choice) and when I talk to people now it‚Äôs clear that those have stuck with people. Very frustrating, especially the ‚ÄúBernie thinks a woman can‚Äôt win‚Äù story (which I fully believe her campaign wanted no part of).
That white in white ass NH. She‚Äôs either gotta fight or she‚Äôs going to fade into obscurity.
Keep in mind perspective.  Sanders and Buttigieg  won NH, their supporters would take any criticism of their candidate especially hard.  She called them out, and their supporters get defensive. It is kinda natural in this current political environment.  Not going to deny misogyny is not a factor, but I think the team mentality may have more on this specific situation.
[removed]
I agree with all of this except for going after Bernie. Yes, we know she would be infinitely more effective and academic in her administration, but we can‚Äôt go after our only ally left in the race. We need progressive unity come the convention, and Bernie is likely to win. If we don‚Äôt like the way Warren supporters are often treated, then we should treat them the way we‚Äôd want to be treated: with respect for them and their candidate who shares our policy platform and ideals
Wow, fuck that guy.  And fuck "democratic" unity--that guy held elected office as a Republican, and clearly is one at heart.
A) Pretty sure you‚Äôre ascribing to me something I did not say. There are other factors that can sometimes correlate with race but do not necessarily directly determine race, yet they cannot be used if they may adversely affect certain groups - racial or otherwise - even if is a valid result based purely on risk profile.   B) Fair point, but is it the banks‚Äô duty to subsidize them at the expense of their other customers?  Or should there be other programs to address this?  It‚Äôs debatable.   C)  Also a fair point, though bank employees, customers, shareholders, and those who depend on a stable financial system are all people as well.
Being on the debate stage gives him more legitimacy and he doesn‚Äôt deserve any.
They should be putting him through the ringer without legitimizing his candidacy. The party should be moderating and leading the debates themselves TBH. Letting the media run it just gives them leverage to gin up horse race bullshit and stoke conflict without shedding any light. Just look now, Klobuchar does well in a debate, she surges, AND THEN they start vetting her. It‚Äôs completely backwards.  If the party runs it, they can require people to go through the process to qualify and tell the ones who don‚Äôt to pound sand.
I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would vote in that situation, and that‚Äôs saying a lot. After listening to the audio that leaked where he talked about stop and frisk I believe he is genuinely racist.  I might vote for him, I might write-in, I might vote for a third party. I‚Äôd have to really consider if I believed things would improve for marginalized people w/ him as President.
Exactly.  Like, we need another billionaire from New York in the White House?  Because that worked so well before?
Yeah I would have to think about it pretty hard. Imo Bloomberg is like a smarter trump, which is better in some ways but much worse in others  EDIT:  Ways that it's better:  He's not overtly racist/misogynistic on TV, doesn't blunder his way into national security crises, he'd do better on gun control and addressing climate change.  Ways that it's worse: He would be more organized and subtle about continuing to benefit the wealth and expand systematic racism.  Ways that it's neutral: He'll still prioritize corporate interests.
He won't get my vote.  Bloomberg is just a more effective version of Trump. Bloomberg is racist, he's a republican, and he cares more about corporations than human beings.   I'd honestly rather vote for Trump. At least then congress will still spend every day obstructing Trump rather than cooperating with Bloomberg.
A mood stable, savvier version of Trump who can hide lying? No thanks.
Yes, I'm thinking less of "candidates who take billionaire donors" and focus more on their legislative / executive / prosecutorial flubs.
I agree completely, and I would not want it to seem rehearsed, but she should try and set it up that when she does go one the offensive it will 1) be presented in a media friendly manner and 2) be stuff that most Democrats will agree with.  The media cannot resist drama, and her going on the offense will get tons of media play.  And if she is on the right side of the issue, at least from most Democrats point of view, it will be positive coverage.    Some potential topics I can see:  1)  Bloomberg--honestly I think she should eviscerate him and not hold back.  Redlining, Stop and Frisk, Buying Elections, Differentiate her evolvement from Democrat 30 years ago with his strategic party switch, what a year ago?.  2)  Biden--there are probably quite a few things I could see her going after him on.  Personally I want to see her go after him on his bankruptcy bill.  I also feel like Biden takes is African American vote for granted, I would love to see her go after what specific policies he has to address issues faced by POC and compare them to her policies.  3)  Buttigieg--his inexperience.  I know Biden went after him in a recent ad, but I think the ad came off as attacking Buttigieg for doing is job as mayor.  I think the inexperience argument should be focused on his lack of legislatures experience, especially regarding the ins and outs of the US Congress and the players.  Also his lack of experience at the federal issues that he would not have as a mayor.  4)  Sanders--I don't think she should go hard on Sanders directly.  I do think she needs to draw a distinction between his specific policies and hers and explain why hers is better.  She needs to show she is not Bernie-lite, she is a Bernie alternative.  They are both progressive, but Sanders is big dreams with questionable paths to accomplish them and "socialism," Warren is pragmatic progressivism and capitalism, regulated to work for the middle and lower classes.  5)  Klobucher-- I don't know if she needs to specifically go after her.  I think the female solidarity plays well and I am not sure Klobucher has enough momentum to be an actual threat to risk the solidarity message.  I do agree that she does need to stop doing Klobucher's PR now and not praise her anymore.  She also needs to take the narrative away that Klobucher is the feisty, witty woman on the stage.  6)  Steyer--I don't think Steyer is enough of a risk to bother attacking.  Also, he really does seem like a nice guy and people seem to like him personally, she may actually come off meaner than she would like going after him.  Last but not Least  7)  Trump-- I would love for her to throw a few punches at Trump.  They should be hard enough to trigger a few rage tweets.  Dems from the left and right seem to love her the most when she burns Trump or one of his minions.  This is just my personal wishlist, but I understand  that she only has so much control over the discussion in debate formats.  I understand too she needs to get her own policies out there.  But I will say that she is a master debater (try and say that phrase 3 times fast and keep a G rating) and I have full confidence she can own that stage if she brings her A game.
Oh I'll vote for him if it's between him and Trump, and I would encourage you to do so as well. Bloomberg is decent (and certainly better than Trump) on climate, guns, he'll be far better on immigration and a few other select issues and you can be assured he'll nominate better judges than Trump.  He's no where close to an ideal Democratic candidate but if turns out he gets the nomination, I'll be volunteering to get him elected just as I would Warren even if I won't enjoy it.
^  I mean, did Margaret Thatcher worry about people calling her mean or did she just fucking steamroll? She was advised to soften her image and come across as more caring.  She did not.  People are attracted to leaders that lead. That can mean a lot of different things but at this point in time I don't think it's the right time to be soft or mute yourself. You might not need to fight fire with fire but you need to show you have spark.
Delete your post; she's obviously a Ravenclaw.
I haven't seen cross tabs published but if I assume your assumptions are correct, why do you think those Bernie supporters chose her over all the other candidates, including Pete and Biden who have been much more negative towards Bernie than her? The answer is simply misogyny.
I want to preface what I'm about to say (which is speculation based on scarce info) with a more likely explanation, Bill Gates came at Warren hard in a couple interviews, fox business also attacks her constantly (because "owning" woman gets more eye balls than owning men regardless of ideology; see Blair White, Tomi Lauren, ect. reply guys) and conservative media has been doing to Warren what they did to Clinton at least since occupy.  But we do know that every source came from within her campaign, not Warren herself but CNN reported that it came from her campaign. Now, there are a lot of Hillary Clinton dead-enders on her team who's motivations might not align with Warren's; and by the time the story dropped it was too late for her turn on her own followers without looking like a mess. At this point, Warren had some attrition in her polls and the only way to build back her support was to fight Sanders for the progressive lane, which is why she attacked him during the NH primary and then attacked his fans yesterday for criticizing the culinary union. I don't expect it to stop either, idk if the bad blood between the two movements can be mended, but in order get the nod at the convention we need to rebuild some kind of truce with the Bernie Bros so they don't bErN iT dOwN1!  If there's a moral to this story it's that a candidates surrogates and followers can escalate a rivalry beyond a candidates ability to control, because supporters started this beef, supporters will have to end this beef. No one is going to "bend the knee", but something must be done.
Removed for spreading misinformation. This is your final warning.
He‚Äôs not been an ally to us though.   I see absolutely no reason why his record shouldn‚Äôt be brought to light on a debate stage. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs dropping attack ads.
I didnt mean to ascribe you something you didnt say, maybe I misinterpreted. The headline mentioned race specifically and you didnt mention any other factors, so I assumed that's what you were referring to
While I agree he doesn't deserve it, that's not stopping him from barreling forward in the polls. Just being on ads all over the country is giving him way more legitimacy than being in one debate would
msnbc's youtube has 5 videos about Bloomberg sandwiched inbetween one video of Warren(where she's talking about him) and one video of Sanders (where he's talking about him. I'm going to be physically I'll.  It doesn't improve on other outlets, Bloomberg coverage outweighs coverage of every other candidate combined. That's how Trump got elected and now the media is actively trying to make the oligarch our nominee (they know how this works they aren't that stupid). They are traitors to democracy, sorry but I have to say it, every single dem candidate has to unite and kick him out of the race or our democracy is officially dead.
>Just look now, Klobuchar does well in a debate, she surges, AND THEN they start vetting her. It‚Äôs completely backwards.  Well they still haven't really started vetting Bernie, so there's that.
Not voting for a Dem helps the GOP. The problem of a 2 party system, which won‚Äôt really change unless the electoral college is gone. And given that the GOP are currently the trump family royalists, every single person in the dem primaries is better. Even if the new guy does literally nothing, it‚Äôs better than the aggressive slide downwards under trump.
That what is ABSOLUTELY killing me, as I see people say they are going toward Bloomberg because they think he can beat trump, and only because of that.      Like is that how poor the condition of the US is? That we're going to meet a racist misogynist white billionaire man with....another racist misogynist white billionaire man? We can't do any better than that? Why even bother having elections then? Just sell the presidency to the highest bidder.
Let‚Äôs not compare trump and Bloomberg. One of those two is highly articulate, mind blowingly successful, intelligent, and has been supporting democratic causes for years. The other is a trust fund baby who was terrible in everything he did apart from marketing himself, has the verbal skills of a preschooler, is authoritarian and anti democracy as hell, and is a generally shitty and racist person (he wanted to kill innocent people, has implemented his disgusting ‚Äústeal babies from asylum seekers ‚Äú policy, etc).
It would be extremely hard for me to vote for him..even over Trump at this point. It would be a definitive message that you could literally buy the Presidency. As evil as he is, Trump took the time to hoodwink people the old fashion way.  The ONLY reason the DNC is "allowing" this is because they are terrified or maybe he threatened to run 3rd party.
It's so scuffed, I wouldn't be suprised if Bloomberg running is a favor to Trump at this point, they found the only thing on earth that could get me to vote for Trump. -\_-
This is probably the most correct answer. "Our" billionaire gets in and all defenses are lowered and everything gets nodded long, "Their" billionaire gets in and at least Democrats have to look like they're doing their jobs.  Drone strikes, repealing glass steagall etc only a fraction of the left turns up to fight when it's on our own watch.
Oh man just no. He‚Äôd turn the party into a far right party and would throw you crumbs on guns and climate just to make you feel better as he continues the systematic targeting of brown people via ICE.
She‚Äôs actually a Gryffindor who the Hat deliberated over for 10 minutes because Ravenclaw also could‚Äôve worked ;)   But she‚Äôs definitely run a Hufflepuff campaign since last winter. She got crucified every time she so much as breathed so she tried playing non confrontational.
Because she is the only competition bernie has for the liberal vote
Of course its misogyny and I agree 100%. A woman speaking out about things and fighting for herself is inherently going to seen as being worse or more untrustworthy. My point is that they have been bombarding Warren with sexist slurs and sexist tropes (liar, snake, etc..). I believe more than half of Bernies votes in New Hampshire were in the 18 - 29 demo (if crosstabs are correct they make up 16.5 of his 26%) and they absolutely are people who go online and see these vicious attack trains and they delegate their anger as such.
Because they didn't, she's an overwhelming second choice netting almost 50%. Plus Berners are too but hurt at Pete to focus on Warren, we need unity not turning against other progressives.
If you start with obviously false assumptions, you can probably draw any conclusion you want. That's why it's dangerous to make those assumptions.   Almost all of those who viewed Warren as the most negative came from the Bernie camp? It's almost statistically impossible given that Bernie only had 26% vote share and 20% held that view. Unless we assume that Warren is Sander's voters least supported second choice, which is absurd.   The data we actually have directly contradicts the prevailing view of this subreddit: only 13% said Sanders had the most negative campaign. This is strong evidence that those "hyper-toxic Bernie Bros" are mainly localized to Reddit, Twitter and other "highly online" places and aren't particularly reflective of the Sanders support base.   *Edit: intended to respond to comment one up chain*
>  Bill Gates came at Warren hard in a couple interviews  You sure about that? He got pretty horribly misquoted for a little bit about his response to the wealth tax where what he actually said in the interview was contradictory to the out of context quote that made the front page.  > But we do know that every source came from within her campaign, not Warren herself but CNN reported that it came from her campaign.  It was also known a year ago when it first broke, but at that time the media was not interested in a Warren V Sanders brawl so the story was pretty boring. But CNN decided that the night before the debate would be a great time to re-break the story and ask about it in an extremely biased way. Then they say it was Warren's campaign who leaked the story and everyone instantly believe them because it fits the narrative they want to believe.  >NH primary and then attacked his fans yesterday for criticizing the culinary union.  Having been on the receiving end of this "criticizing" I can tell you it is pretty unacceptable behavior. Nobody should treat other people like that.
When did CNN say it was the campaign? I don‚Äôt think that happened. An opinion anchor speculated irresponsibly but I don‚Äôt recall any journalists saying definitively that‚Äôs the case.
Maybe so, but for the sake of progressive unity it shouldn't be Warren who brings it up, just in my opinion. We're facing the possibility of our democracy falling into oligarchy and plutocracy, we can't divide the left. Bernie stood up for Warren during the whole script scandal thing, and even apologized when it came out that it did come from a campaign official I believe. No need to feed the Bernie Bros what they want is all I'm saying
No one vets Bernie! It's so frustrating!
As long as he nominates Democratic judges on the appellate level and to the SCOTUS, I don‚Äôt care.
Voting for Bloomberg helps the GOP. So, no. Write-in or no confidence. And vote blue in Congress.
> I see people say they are going toward Bloomberg because they think he can beat trump, and only because of that.  What's so wild to me about this is that people say this with effectively no evidence to back it up. As of just a few weeks ago he had [the highest unfavorability rating](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ups-and-downs-of-candidate-popularity-in-4-charts/) amongst all of the candidates behind Tulsi, and this was before the stop and frisk stuff came into mainstream conversation and despite fewer people having an opinion on him than Biden/Sanders/Warren. He [doesn't do particularly well among independents compared to Biden or Sanders](https://twitter.com/PpollingNumbers/status/1227068915982925824?s=20) and unlike those two he has gotten little to no vetting, no appearances at debates, no opening to criticism or responses. Just empty ads that say the same thing every time. He did hold the top spot in head to head national polling against Trump by a razor thin margin, but again, it makes sense knowing that he hasn't had to face any criticism or backlash whatsoever to this point.  It's almost becoming a self fulfilling prophecy of people gravitating towards him because they think he can beat Trump despite there being no existing base for him to begin with. Do people honestly think he can win over Republicans -- who overwhelmingly support Trump -- while making gun control a central issue of his campaign (not that I disagree with him on gun control but Republicans sure as hell don't)? And any Republicans he does win over will be likely drowned out by the younger or minority voters who would sit out. A Warren or Sanders nomination would bring new people out to vote; a Klobuchar, Buttigieg or Biden nomination probably wouldn't bring out anyone new, but wouldn't cause people to stay home; a Bloomberg nomination would turn a non-negligible percentage of the base away.  I am really hoping he is at the next debate because I think Warren in particular is ready to eviscerate him.
\*supporting Democratic AND Republican causes for years, as recently as 2018 when donating millions to Susan Collins, for example...
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not compare Trump and Bloomberg.‚Äù  Starts next sentence by comparing Trump and Bloomberg.    The thing is that it is hard to tell which is which.    I will give you that Bloomberg can stitch together a coherent sentence but that is about where the distinction stops.    And frankly, the person with Trumps values, but the common sense (decency?) to not say the quiet part out loud is even more dangerous than the Cheeto.
Imagine a smart Trump.  Let's not pretend they're much different.  One is just more intelligent and stable.  Dont be fooled by how articulate someone is.
It's hard to yell about money in politics for a decade and then basically vote a wad of money into office.
I agree. Regardless of what happens this election, I see there being major changes to the two-party system (or at least major changes to the democratic party).   There's a distinct centrist ideology that a lot of moneyed interests currently flock to, and if Trump or a progressive wins, they could consider building their own party.   I have nothing to substantiate this, but the current system seems completely unsustainable.
Idk that everyone goes along with him. We'd still have Bernie, AOC, EW, and the like in Congress. They're well aware of who Bloomberg is, and I trust them to not just go along with his agenda.
Mr. Beefy onto somethin
My state's primary is not until the end of April, but I plan on voting  for Warren for as long as she's in the race. I feel like we always see Bernie supporters touting idealism over pragmatism, and yet they're so quick to want Liz supporters to throw her under the bus when she stops polling well. I *will* be voting for Bernie in the event that he's the only progressive candidate left in the race, but until then I'm not going to deny that I think he'll be a less effective president than Warren.   The idea of giving up our race and throwing a coronation for a "presumptive" nominee is the exact same attitude that Bernie fans fought so hard against in 2016. He'll get my vote when he's the candidate left who I feel best represents me. That's how primaries work.
That's some serious strategery, there.
She got my vote in the state of Washington! Dropped off my ballot on Friday. It ain‚Äôt over til it‚Äôs over,
Would that the rest of America did so as well, my friend.
And if we had ranked choice voting more people would do the same thing.
It‚Äôs a categorical imperative... also LFG!
Hmm, this seems pretty complicated, though.
It really is just that simple, people.
Y‚Äôall, this guy might be on to something here
brilliant
Smart man
*Clutches pearls, drops monocle*
[deleted]
Which is part of my problem with Bernie. Ideology only gets you so far - eventually you have to get things done, which is why a pragmatic progressive like Warren is my choice.
She got my Washington vote too. And I convinced my conservative parents to vote for her! They usually vote republican but they hate Trump. They‚Äôre blue no matter who this year.

Thank you for your nuanced opinion, u/throwawaynewacc
On the other hand, voting for who I think would win but be terrible is not only an irrational belief (fortune-telling/mind-reading) and a self-fulfilling prophecy, it makes me feel like shit.

Warren is more than just slightly better than Bernie for me.
>But you don't have to make that terrible choice.  There is another candidate who's leading in most Super Tuesday polls  That IS the choice that makes me feel like shit. I continue to be glad I early voted for Warren in TX and I don't give one good goddamn who's leading in how many states. And I don't come to r/ELIZABETHWARREN to hear this negativity.
It's for you to weigh it all.

Removed for trolling.
I'm jumping ship and going with Warren
Welcome to the team :)
Additionally, she didn't just come out hard with the Ukraine scandal, she was the first (if not the only) candidate to come out for impeachment *immediately* after the Mueller report was released.  https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2019/4/19/18508224/elizabeth-warren-mueller-report-trump-impeachment
Biden sounds like a swell person to grab lunch with sometime.  i don‚Äôt want him to be the president though.
Welcome. Tell your family, tell your friends.
Glad to have you. I had a similar thought process.
Warren is great. I was with Bernie, but his supporters constantly throwing out conspiracy theories have made me jump ship. I just don‚Äôt understand how people have trouble accepting the fact that she is running a better campaign and is really connecting with people.
They DO exist! This is the first pro Biden person I've encountered in the wild.
Well said and glad to have you aboard! I have never felt as confident and strongly towards a candidate as I have with Warren. I‚Äôm with her!
Welcome to the party! Not only do we get to support a leader who's brilliant and tenacious, but also that means you get to vote for Bailey as First Dog because he's a Very Good Boy(tm).
To know Elizabeth Warren is to love her.  I'm glad you got to know Elizabeth Warren.
I just unsubbed from the Bernie sub. It's turning into a negative jerk off sub. I've been a supporter of both and I will continue to but ugh. They act like Liz is worse than Hillary because they're jealous of her numbers.
Warren is great. Don't sleep on Buttigieg either!
Me, too.
Welcome, and thank you for taking the time to consider why you support a candidate over another.
Welcome! This is a great time to join us, it looks like Warren's steady plans to build momentum are starting to show serious progress now that a few polls are starting to show her pulling ahead of Biden.
What part of the Reddit algorithms makes me get a notification for these? There‚Äôs more upvotes now but the first time it happened it was only at 90 and this one was at 300. I‚Äôm not mad about it, just curious
Welcome to the Warren side!
It is hopeful to see Warren unite factions of the party. I was strongly pro Bernie 2016 after being disappointed Warren was not running. I trust Warren with our world in her compassionate and persistent hands.
Yeah totally.  I've been a Warren fan for a couple months now.  Early on I thought maybe Pete was our guy, and he might be in 2024 or 2028, but for this moment we need someone more willing to go full frontal attack on corruption and wealth inequality.  This means Warren or Sanders, and I think Warren is just sharper (ie Bernie is starting to slow down a bit) and has more longevity in her to be fierce for the up to 8 years we might need her for.  Welcome to the club!
Yay, welcome! I think your overall arc will be true of a lot of voters in the coming months. She could really run away with it if so.
[removed]
Welcome! I actually have a lot of affection for Uncle Joe. It just doesn't feel like this is his moment, national polling notwithstanding. If recent history has taught us anything, the Establishment candidate always loses.
I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre with warren now, but i‚Äôve genuinely never met a Biden supporter. Can you explain what drew you to him bc i can‚Äôt think of any reason.
[removed]
Bidens been dropping in the polls ever since the Ukraine thing came out
[removed]
It certainly looks like she is steadily building a broad coalition. I'm a very liberal person but also somewhat pragmatic when it comes to politics, so I get turned off by candidates promising the moon. Warren has a lot of ideas, many of which are major reforms, but they feel practical at the same time.
This is not meant as a criticism or Warren or anyone else but, substantively, I don't think it's important or all that interesting that Warren came out for impeachment first - or at all. Senators don't have any say in impeachment proceedings - and to my knowledge Warren has not gone as far to say that she would vote to convict if impeachment in the House occurred (though undoubtedly every Democratic Senator would). To me, all this is signaling and politics to fire up the base... which is fine! I just think we give it more attention than it deserves.

Not the only one.  >‚ÄúI read the Mueller report the day it came out,‚Äù she told the NAACP delegates who unanimously voted on Tuesday to recommend the House launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. ‚ÄúWhen I got to the end, I did not stick my finger in the air and ask about the politics, I did not hesitate.

He was an effective--if compromised--Democrat for two generations. He deserves a happy retirement.
I did discuss it with my wife. She had the same thinking as I did and was going with Biden but now that Warren seems like a strong nominee, she is switched to Warren. I'm trying to convince my father. He is going with Biden right now but only because Biden had been doing better in the polls against Trump than Warren. That seems to be slowly changing with Warren doing about as well as Obama did vs McCain at this point in the 2008 election. He's not in love with Biden and would much rather have Warren as president but for awhile at least, Biden looked like more of a sure thing. If her numbers hold steady then I think my whole family will be going with Warren when the primaries come around.
I live in Illinois which has its primary pretty late this round. I'm sure it will be largely decided by the time things get to me but if not, I will do what I can.
I try really hard not to hold the candidate responsible for the actions of his supporters, but it gets harder and harder the more it becomes a pattern. I definitely know Sanders supporters who reflect positively on their candidate; they're intelligent, grounded, and reasonable. They typically have Warren as their #2 or #3 candidate.  Unfortunately their less chill counterparts are disproportionately vocal.
yes supporters tones have definitely turned me off other candidates. So far mine are pete and warren. different reasons, but GENERALLY they're a nicer bunch than other people I used to donate to.
[removed]
SAME. Loonball clown fiesta over there sometimes, yikes.   And if anyone says it's just outliers and trolls again I will seize you by the means of production so help me god...
Which candidate do you agree with more? Policy wise.
Really connecting with illegal immigrants maybe.  Open borders and free healthcare!!!  She has zero chance.
And they‚Äôre voting for warren üòÜ
HE'S SO CUTEEEEE. I hope he gets a little green tie.
Buttigieg has virtually no chance, but I'm glad he's staying in to raise his profile for future elections.
Buttigieg was my favorite, but I just don't think he's going to gain any more reasonable chance, and I really, really like Warren.
I think he would be a excellent advisor or even vice pres!
He‚Äôs a boring pragmatist.
Warren is way better than Buttigieg he‚Äôs been trying to lie that M4A would cost more in taxes even though you wouldn‚Äôt have to pay your insurance company is basically a private tax.
I don't get notification for anything, and I'm a mod.  Must be a setting somewhere.  Is that part of the "save" functionality?
$1000 a month + a new tax (VAT) to everyone or healthcare to everyone with a tax on the wealthy?   Yang isn‚Äôt gonna get both done in the next 4 years, so choose one (1).  Plus Warren has experience standing up to the financial industry where Yang has experience *participating in* it... Not saying you can‚Äôt vote for Yang but you‚Äôre not gonna find many people on this sub who support him over Warren. The reason we don‚Äôt support him isn‚Äôt just because we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know about him‚Äù lol
This comment has been removed for breaking Rule 4 (Dividing Democrats)
I don't really know if there's a correlation. I think Biden would've dropped regardless.
He's been dropping before that and Liz has been climbing before that too. I hope no candidate in the primary gives oxygen to that garbage story about Ukraine.
You think a candidate who can't poll above 2% with her own party has the best chance of winning the general?
> but every time someone asks Warren if middle class taxes are going to go up, she avoids the question.  It‚Äôs smart of her to avoid, because it‚Äôs a misleading question meant to get soundbytes.   Her point is that the overall cost for healthcare includes many things, including taxes, and overall costs under her plan will go down.
Trump won 2016 election in three states with a 100k vote margin. I think we can't emphasize enough how narrow a margin of victory that was for Trump. It's the second closest election in modern history.   Trumps's victory was absolute lightning in a bottle and neither of the top three candidates right now - Bernie, Biden, or Liz are going to be approaching the general with the same issues that Clinton had. For starters, none of them are being invested by the FBI. There will not be a Comey letter released two weeks before the election. Even the first major scandal that Biden's wrapped up in isn't resonating since it's so clearly manufactured.  Since the election, Trump's approval rating has been completely stagnant. He hasn't climbed above 44% approval rating since taking office. That's unprecedented. This means that public sentiment against Trump is baked in. There's no ground swell in support of Trump. He's as underwater with independents as he is with Democrats. Trump has a base that is extremely loyal, but that's all he has - his base. He has old white guys and evangelical protestants. That's it. That's his entire base.   We also have a model for Democrats path to victory. Traditionally moderate to Republican leaning suburbs flipped from Republicans to Democrats in 2018. Democrats won Congressional seats they haven't won in decades. Democrats, for the first time, overwhelmingly won college educated voters. Just look at PA - PA was a big victory  for Dems since they suburbs flipped hard in favor of Democrats. PA isn't even in play anymore for Trump. His path to victory is WI and MI (both states that Dems did well in) and they still have to play defense in states like AZ, NC, and FL.  Seriously, just look at certain issues like healthcare. Healthcare is consistently the highest polling issue for Democrats and independents. Republicans are petrified of even talking about healthcare [so much so that when Trump brought it up earlier this year, he was lambasted by Republicans for doing so](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/436973-mcconnell-to-trump-were-not-repealing-and-replacing-obamacare).  That isn't to say that Trump couldn't win. He absolutely could. But extraordinary circumstances got Trump elected and it will require extraordinary circumstances for Trump to get elected again. The top three are probably the most qualified to unseat Trump. I would argue that the rest of the field, save maybe Booker, would actually have more trouble than the top three. Tulsi, in particular, would have a lot of trouble generating enthusiasm in the base.
>I understand it's the primaries, but every time someone asks Warren if middle class taxes are going to go up, she avoids the question.   She avoids the question because she's refusing to give them the sound bite they want and because there's actual nuances to the issue.   What Warren tends to say is "‚Äúcosts are going to go up for the wealthiest Americans, for big corporations ‚Ä¶ and hard-working middle-class families are going to see their costs going down."   Which is true
[removed]
[removed]
Gabbard? No, fuck that. I don't like her at all. She's way too cozy with Fox News, Breitbart, and there is some evidence that she is pro-Putin. No, leave me alone with that Gabbard shit.
You believe Tulsi Gabbard has the best chance? Even as she's been polling mostly at 0% and only occasionally at 1%? Who would vote for her as the Democratic candidate with 0% and 1% of Democratic support?
>Warren/Sanders have been going far too left for democratic moderates  I would be surprised if people weren't saying this about Obama in 2008
Of the people who can be moved and would vote for either party, I seriously think that the red scare factor is overestimated. Tulsi just isn't a strong candidate. She has one good issue, anti-interventionism, but lacks the deep understanding to implement urgent priorities like medicare for all, or combating climate change. Maybe in 2028. Meanwhile, both Warren and Sanders seem to be more than capable of doing these things, while Biden is... Biden.
I honestly don't get what Tulsi offers from a dovish standpoint that other progressive Dems don't. Warren was straightforward at the last debate that she would pull out of Afghanistan no matter what in her first year. She didn't mince words with that.   I guess I don't get why I should hitch my wagon to a low-polling candidate who's happy to divide Dems for a spot on a Fox News panel, when I have a much more capable candidate who promotes party unity and has a much clearer path to the nomination and the presidency.
Tulsi would've been great if she could've put together literally any coalition imaginable. I have no idea what makes you think she could've gotten more people to vote for her than Trump. Her largest problem is her anti-war stance and that makes her just as *dangerously progressive* as any of the other candidates you described. How are you saying things like this after the several days that Trump has had? You don't think this impeachment is going to change how this election shapes up?
This is very true. Most recent Quinnipiac polling shows that she has roughly even support across all age groups right now. Her support among black voters has nearly doubled since July.   In general, her message is a winning one. Ask anyone what‚Äôs problematic about government, no matter their ideology, and they‚Äôll agree that corruption is a problem. And it‚Äôs also in direct opposition to what Trump embodies  And as for her plans, it‚Äôs sort of a more realist take on what Bernie supports. The way she presents her ideas makes them seem both ideal and possible. Bernie speaks in an abstract sense that makes it hard for people to buy in that aren‚Äôt already quite left. Simply put, Bernie moved our side of the Overton window left, but I think Warren presents a more realistic chance at moving the entire window left
To me, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a Warren fan rather than a Bernie fan. I think that if either of them were given carte blanche to do what they‚Äôd like, I‚Äôd be happy with either of them, and the world would look similar. But, in the reality of politics, you don‚Äôt always get what you want, and Warren, to me, seems like she‚Äôd make better judgments about when to compromise, once she‚Äôd laid out and fought for what she believes in. Like, I want single payer/Medicare for All. But if, after the wrangling in Congress, a public option is the best we can get, freaking take it. Make progress. I don‚Äôt care for those suggesting just a public option NOW. Figure out what you believe in, put it on the table, fight for it, and, when you have to compromise to get something accomplished at all, know when it‚Äôs time to do that. If you START from the compromised position, then when you compromise further, you get less.   I think Warren 100 percent gets this. Not sure about anyone else understanding it, though.
> steadily building a broad coalition  I think at this point I'd be surprised if she's *not* the nominee for this reason.  Anecdotal of course, but, my mother is a middle-class, suburban, moderate Democrat. I'm a working-class, urban, progressive Democrat. She doesn't get what I see in Bernie and I don't get what she sees in Biden, but we both like Warren.
> Warren has a lot of ideas, many of which are major reforms, but they feel practical at the same time.  One of the things that initially drew me to Warren as well!
You also get the sense that if its not doable she isn‚Äôt going to get the country in a worse position to make it happen. Things need to make sense.
I agree, and I think they feel pragmatic in part because Elizabeth Warren is an excellent teacher. She makes it clear *how* many of her policy items would come into fruition, and when it‚Äôs a heavy lift she is not in denial about it, she is realistic.
Well said!

OP is talking about how Warren's leadership on impeachment changed their mind. So I'm pointing out that she has been leading on this issue for a long time.  The point is simply that impeaching Trump was the right thing to do then and it is the right thing to do now. Wrongdoing is wrongdoing whether it's politically expedient or not. Warren took a risk calling for impeachment then, but her arguments were totally sound while everyone else was making political arguments about it. Saying "It will hurt Democrats in 2020. It's a distraction. Etc."  It was a big deal at the time, but no one paid much attention because she wasn't ahead in the polls.  Furthermore, when it comes to impeachment many have realized that she is leading the Democrat thinking on the issue.  https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/09/inside-nancy-pelosi-impeachment-cave-elizabeth-warren
Would be curious to see an article from the time of his announcement if you got one.
From your own article:  >‚ÄúThis is a moment in history and every single member of Congress should be called on to vote and to live with that vote for the rest of their lives,‚Äù said Warren, **who was the first presidential candidate to push for impeachment** ‚Äì a point of distinction that she emphasized.  (Furthermore your article was published 3 months after the one I linked)
>If her numbers hold steady then I think my whole family will be going with Warren when the primaries come around.  [Her RCP average](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) has steadily increased whereas Bernie and Biden are both stagnant. She's actually cracking 20% now, and Joe is below 30. She's the #2 choice for a large percentage of both Biden and Sanders voters, so I don't think anything's gonna stop her now! She's got the momentum and the excitement that's gonna carry her all the way to the nomination. Especially if she can win in some of the early states, which already look great for [Iowa](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/iowa/) and [New Hampshire](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/new-hampshire/). The most recent Selzer & Co poll from Iowa, and  Monmouth University poll from New Hampshire both have Warren leading Biden 2%. These are both A+ rating pollsters according to 538.
I think Biden's strength in the polls is a house of cards.  He is strong in the polls because he is seen as being strong in the polls. It means he will lose a lot of support if another candidate can prove they are also the "electability" candidate.
I've been concerned about the GE polling as well, but if you look at the numbers, Trump is basically at the same number no matter who he faces. It's only the number of people outright supporting the Dem. And both Sanders and Biden have much higher recognition than Warren so I think any of the top 5-6 candidates would have solid leads once people knew them if they were the nominee.
Tell him historically [polls today about a general election are actually meaningless](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/amp/?__twitter_impression=true). Not like "treat with caution" but "basically unrelated to results next November, do not use them at all." Ones from last June are off by 11 points on avg. Hillary was up 15-20 on everyone for instance.   That's why Warren is now doing well in generals, the tuned out middle actually knows who she is now, just like they would for the other 10+ candidates outside the top 3 who have low GE polls. Meaningless.
[Oh I wouldn't put money on that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Illinois_Democratic_primary). March 17th this time, March 15th last time, that's not super late. Two weeks after Super Tuesday. Plus you are right next to IOWA.  No rest for the persistent!
The unreasonable ones remind me of Trump supporters in some ways when they say Bernie's our only hope.
In my experience, the only people who claim you're wrong for saying toxic supporters are a reason to not support a candidate are the toxic supporters that don't want to be held accountable.   People don't interact with the candidate. They interact with fellow supporters. Campaigns full of toxic supporters don't happen on accident.
I feel like they were so welcoming this time around at the start. Then all of a sudden they started a movement that every candidate other than Bernie is a corporate shill. I‚Äôm not about that scene.
Anecdotally, I know Bernie supporters who jumped to Trump after Clinton was nominated.  There‚Äôs a lot of personality overlap between those fandoms.
I completely understand why that makes people mad. Their policies are radically different obviously.   But they're both at their core populists. History shows that populism has people across the board and the politics themselves are secondary. They all have some way of saying they're benefiting some group of their "people" the most.   But functionally they are very similar. Populists also tend to promote the person over the policies. The bird that landed on his podium for example and immediately became an icon. That's such a populist thing. Trump has his hats and the wall is an icon. How Sanders defends his bills with "I wrote the damn bill" rather than the substance of it. He's defending it because its him.  Populism scares the hell out of me. Making people into icons has rarely gone well.
They say "Those aren't real Bernie supporters."  Yeah, they are.   The final straw has been their efforts to turn Elizabeth into Hillary because they want a redo of 2016.
From this sample we can extrapolate that they all are!
She posted a video of him under the influence of the zoomies last night and her laughing like every other dog owner at seeing their dog be crazy excited.
why?   I would like to remind everyone that at this point in time Carter, Clinton, Kerry, Obama all were down in the polls in iowa.  Clinton eventually lost iowa b/c the other candidate was from iowa. But Kerry in 2004 was where pete was and Howard Dean and dick gephardt is exactly where warren and biden is.   Also what do you mean "raise his profile" ?
The primaries aren't for betting on "who has the best chance of winning." Fear-based support-who-will-win voting is how we get Biden.  The primaries are for supporting who you deep-down believe to be the very best candidate. If, for you, that's Mayor Pete, then vote for Pete. Even if he loses the primary, a high turnout for Pete (or Yang, Booker, Kamala, whomever) will send a strong message to the winning nominee, and it will influence their policies going forward (knowing that they have a large group of Democrats who did *not* support him/her, but they'll still need to win their support in the general election).
urgh i come to each of warren and pete's subs in an attempt keep them separate. But I've defended warren last week and gotten downvoted on the pete sub for it, now seems I have to do the reverse.  Okay, he's not a pragmatist. I honestly think he realizes the path forward to any progressive future is democratic reform. Warren is for similar policies, **but has not made it her day 1 priority**. Pete is for on his first day:  * HR1  * abolishing electoral college  * state hood for PR and DC  * SCOTUS reform  * getting rid of citizens united (even if HR1 will make super pac donations more transparent)  W/o these reforms then: wealth tax, m4a.....etc (everything liz wants) will never happen. And even if some of them happens, they will be repealed come the next time GOP win house/senate or presidency again. Even then the makeup of court will surely end w/ SCOTUS ruling some of these laws/reforms will be illegal.  Only way to prevent any backwards movement on progress is getting these reforms done. These aren't pragmatic choices, **these are progressive choices to make sure our future legislative successes will never be taken away.** As facts and history tell us, presidents have a limited window to enact change, most of Liz's policy will not be enacted (fact of senate map) and same with what I listed about pete. The issue is until we make these reforms (Package A) we won't get Package B (wealth tax, free tuition, m4a...etc) done, or it will be repealed.   Anyway, I'm pretty now even with warren and pete. But this "pragmatist" label misses the point.
Even if that's true, is the such a bad thing to have in the white house? If anything I'd say they're both quite boring
I mean... It would cost more *in taxes* though... Total costs will do down but we will pay more taxes to fund it. Let's not beat around the bush. It's worth it. And it's cheaper to pay more in taxes than more in premiums
He also charges $500/selfie. https://www.avpress.com/opinion/how-to-get-a-selfie-with-elizabeth-warren-in-eight/article_7708528a-af3b-11e9-ac64-d3870105d681.html
What's wrong about that statement? He wants Warren to plainly state the fact that taxes WILL go up under her plan and to counter that fact by mentioning how private insurance premiums will also go away. He's telling the truth of her plan, while she dances around it when questioned.   https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/warren-shed-raise-middle-class-taxes-pay-health/story?id=65701494  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/19/question-elizabeth-warren-wont-answer/  https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/20/taxes-are-the-least-of-elizabeth-warrens-medicare-for-all-problems.html  It's well documented that she will not answer the question straightly. Her response each time isn't a lie, but it's also not answering the question that she's specifically being asked. It's a legitimate criticism. Isn't it frustrating to see someone ask a question, only to have the politician give a response that doesn't address the actual question? Warren is usually good at giving straight answers so I'm not sure what the issue is with this question.  It doesn't change that they're my top two picks.
I don‚Äôt know, the weird thing is I wasn‚Äôt following this sub, and I doubt these things were trending.
I could see like Tulsi hitting him over it. Maybe Castro. It's unlikely that any of the frontrunners would imagine going near it.
If you seriously think party performance = national performance I don't know what to tell you.
Costs of healthcare as a total? Yes, it's going to go down. But the cost coming out of your paycheck is going to go up. That's what a lot of Americans care about. Not everyone uses the healthcare system. Check the 2012 census healthcare statistics. There is a literal quote from Brett O'Hara the chief of the Census Bureau's Health and disability branch. "The decline in the use of medical services was widespread, taking place regardless of health status." The fact of the matter is most people do not use our healthcare system, I'm not here to debate whether that is good or bad, the fact is it's not used. That means even if you're not using it, you're still going to be charged for it. That's a big issue to many Americans. If your solution is to then get more people to use healthcare that is going to overburden the healthcare system. Currently burnout in the healthcare profession is rampant. There is a recent study (2018) by Thomas P. Reith that shows over 1/2 of physicians and 1/3 of nurses experience burnout due to exhaustion and cynicism from long term job stress. Throwing more people into that system will not help. Of course I am biased because I work at a trauma one hospital, but I literally live this every single day. You cannot expect our healthcare professionals to take on more work.

I mean... I like warren much more than Gabbard, but are we really going to call her an alt-right darling? Can we please stop this?
Angry About Warren‚Äôs Exit? Use That Energy to Take Back the Senate
[Jaime Harrison!](https://jaimeharrison.com/)   This man is trying to unseat Lindsey Graham. I want to see a black man take Graham's job so bad.
Cross post this into r/politics . I feel like this is needed there.
This is what I'm concentrating on.  I'm going to be throwing what little money I have at getting rid of Mitch and Susan Collins and trying to keep Doug Jones.
Gotta say, the chances of taking back the Senate have slowly been increasing... Bullock's announcement has moved the needle just a bit. I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but my god, if we do take it back, it would be the greatest birthday present ever and would nullify everything shitty about this primary.
r/voteblue
Yep. I‚Äôm donating to Crooked Media‚Äôs Get Mitch or Die Trying fund and I‚Äôm going to find one (or two) specific races to get more involved with. (Currently thinking AZ since it‚Äôs geographically closest to me and maybe also ME because FUCK Susan Collins).
Will be supporting Barbara Bollier in Kansas, who has a real shot if Kobach is the nominee. Also donating to Joni Ernst's opponent, whoever that will be.
Colorado's Cory Gardner (R) is pretty weak and likely to get replaced by the Dem Candidate. Right now we're trying to choose between the billionaire-backed, frak water drinking Oil and Gas candidate Hickenlooper and the progressive m4A supporting green candidate, Andrew Romanoff.     The senate races matter. You can't just wait to vote for the (D), cause who knows who will get that slot. Get involved now.
Best way to get M4A
I‚Äôm focusing on unseating Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell. I think we have a shot at both!   I would love to see all of the senate races against Republican incumbents hire some of Warren‚Äôs staff. She built a strong coalition!
don't forget local races, or perhaps even run for office yourself!  Our local and state legislature is a joke and I'm looking forward to campaigning for some fresh faces.
Introducing "Get Mitch or Die Trying" fund started by Pod Save America: [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/getmitch](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/getmitch)  I'll leave it here.
I like the idea of focusing on down-ticket races.  After seeing how so many people involved in this election have been acting, I‚Äôve decided I don‚Äôt want anger to be the key driving force in life.   It‚Äôs not what I want my life to be about. You know that saying ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not angry, you‚Äôre not paying attention?‚Äù I don‚Äôt buy it.
YUP that's exactly what I'm doin
If I wanted to volunteer to flip a senate seat in a state that has the most chance to help in the presidential general election who should pick?  I think the most efficient use of my time is to get people to the polls in a state or states that will help whichever cis straight white old man we get, while helping to get him (it‚Äôs always a him) a senate.   Ideas?
I really like this pivot. While some of our energy should of course be going to blue no matter who in the general, it's vitally important we get McConnell out of power by flipping the senate. Get Mitch or Die Trying.
Yes sorry. Of course you‚Äôre right. I just mean he has noticeably changed. As the podcast linked above goes into, there seems to be a definite Graham 1.0 and a Graham 2.0 - some republicans do not like the new version.
Not angry, just very sad.  At least we still have Bernie.
I still want to see Warren as senate majority leader.  She's a damn sight better than Schumer.
here is a list of progressives running for congress (also check the brand new congress, rose caucus, and justice dems slates): /r/WayOfTheBern/comments/f73wkl/list_of_2020_progressives_running_for/
Don't forget Cal Cunningham in North Carolina, which in fact is much more winnable than its southern counterpart. Thom Tillis is just as insidious and is a much weaker incumbent than Lindsey Graham.  Cunningham gave a great interview on Pod Save America today. Definitely send him some money.
We can trade a bad Graham for a good Graham! There's a woman named Kimberly Graham running for Senate in Iowa and on a trip to DC, she took a picture in front of Lindsey Graham's office and covered his first name so it looked like her future office! She's so lovely, if you're in Iowa please check out her [website](https://kimberlyforiowa.com)
That would probably make Graham all hot and bothered if he got spanked by a black man.
Love him! Have been contributing to his campaign. What a win that would be!!
I remember him from years back being interviewed by Rachel Maddow!  I like him.  It would be fabulous.
Oh man yes.
Cross post to r/voteblue or r/Democrats2020 instead
You aren't allowed to say you're mad that Warren left there.
God, wouldn't it be amazing if there was a democratic president who could actually get something through congress.
Bullock's announcement literally got me in a good mood today despite sleeping for only six hours.
My plans for donation (after their respective primaries) are:  * Amy McGrath (vs McConnell, KY) * Sara Gideon (vs Collins, ME) * Teresa Tomlinson (vs Loeffler, GA) * Barbara Bollier (open race in KS) * Mark Kelly (vs McSally, AZ) * John Hickenlooper(vs Gardner, CO) * Cal Cunningham (vs Tillis, NC) * Steve Bullock (vs Daines, MT)  and maybe (though its a long shot)  * Doug Jones (AL incumbent)  Nearly all of them are more centrist than I am, but that's the nature of having the biggest tent.
\#SendMoscowMitchPacking!
I have a question about the Get Mitch or Die Trying fund. So they split it between 11 funds, including Georgia. Does it further split the GA share between the two GA Senate races (normal one and the special election), or just fund one of them?
I grew up in KS and although it‚Äôs a Red State it‚Äôs way more politically complicated than people give  it credit for. Blew me away when they elected Laura Kelly and Sharice Davids in 2018. I think Bollier has a shot.
Same here! Governor Kelly has been a good balancing force against our colossally moronic legislature, and we partially have Kobach to thank for helping hand it to us.   Its gonna be tougher to get Bollier into the Senate, especially because we won't have Orman splitting the GOP vote. But she's a moderate, has a history of working across the aisle, and Kansas hates Trump way more than our partisan lean would suggest, so we got a chance here.
So focus on down ticket races with a rosie outlook.
Arizona, Maine, Colorado are probably the most likely pickups.  Alabama if you want to help defend the most vulnerable democrat
Arizona imo. It‚Äôs a swing state in the presidential race and we have a solid shot of flipping the Senate too. Big turnout for Dems for the Senate race could had the presidential race to the Dems too.
I hope Cal Cunningham wins. My mother and father in law will only vote republican so I know they will vote for Tillis. Hopefully we can get enough people to vote
Or send him some phonebanking hours, or if you're in North Carolina, get a few friends and go canvassing for him.
Pod Save America! I‚Äôll have to listen that episode (listen to most of them, just wait for a road trip to binge). Thanks for the suggestion.
The r/politics mods don‚Äôt even pretend to moderate impartially. It‚Äôs just a space for Russian disinformation and propaganda at this point.
Ya true
Same, daylight savings always messes me up.
There‚Äôs some important primaries, too, like Ed Markey & Marie Newman.
Don't forget Jaime Harrison! He is fighting for Lindsey Graham's seat. He & Amy McGrath are my main focus.      If elected, it would be literally the ONLY time two black men have served simultaneously in Senate for southern states.
I'd add Al Gross, a liberal independent in Alaska endorsed by AK Dems running against Dan Sullivan, who is not particularly popular. He's fundraised very well so far and has a solid chance.
Honestly, this might be one benefit of Biden as the nominee; I think he will have longer coat tails for these candidacies.  What a game changer it would be!
Three cheers for Mark Kelly! So excited for his campaign. My favorite senate candidate I think and not just because I'm a space nut. Amazing what he and his wife have been through. I love that he's really leaning into electing a senator that actually believes in science. That's great. You KNOW he'll push HARD for gun control. Really excited for that one.
>Nearly all of them are more centrist than I am, but that's the nature of having the biggest tent.  That's more the nature of running electable candidates of the 'right' party in conservative, moderate and purple states.  An example of this is GOP SuperPACs spending millions to primary Cal Cunningham with a progressive Dem candidate that would never win a GE in NC this year.    Thank you for your support.
McGrath doesn't need more money and is very likely to lose. Kentucky is deep red and is really hard to make inroads in unless the incumbent is a moron like Matt Bevin, and even his loss was insanely narrow.  Send money to Gary Peters in Michigan. He's the incumbent but is facing a strong opponent in John James. Also Tomlinson is running against David Perdue; the candidate to support in the open race is Rev. Raphael Warnock.
Hickenlooper (in Colorado) is against M4A, is pro-Oil and Gas, and has billionaire donors. Andrew Romanov is contesting him for the Dem nomination for that Senate seat and is doing pretty well. Romanov is much more progressive.     If Hickenlooper gets the nomination, I'll support him. But that is still in the air and until then I'm pushing for a more progressive Senate.
[removed]
I'm not sure. I think that the way the fund splits is subject to change as the race develops. If polling shows that both seats have a chance to flip, they'll fund both, but I think that maybe if polling is only showing one seat with potential to flip, they might put all their funding there.
Especially because she was a lifelong liberal Republican who just switched parties along with a handful of others after 2018. If she can get endorsements from retired well-liked moderate Republican former senators/reps, she will have a very good chance.
Same. I knew the 3rd district could flip, though even I was (pleasantly) surprised that it went for Sharice. Kelly seems like she's even better than Sebelius (knock on wood).   I'm really rooting for Bollier. Even making it competitive will force the GOP to divert resources there they normally wouldn't.
Yup. I never thought a Dem would have a chance at the Senate seat there growing up but I'm cautiously optimistic now! Certainly seeing the 3rd go from blue dog Dennis Moore to Yoder then to Sharice Davids was huge. And, maybe I'm off base here, but it seems like Kelly is more progressive than Sebelius was. So I'm quite hopeful!
Isn‚Äôt it most important to commit to ethical behavior when things **aren‚Äôt** rosy?  I feel like how bad things are is the excuse people are using for resorting to low blows and assuming the worst of all of the supporters of the other candidate.
It's gonna come down to the suburbs and rural African Americans. North Carolina has the votes to make it happen.
Do your best to change their mind. Look at his policies and find specific things that matter to them. Then look at things Tillis has done and find things you know they won't like. Every vote counts.
No one here likes Tillis.  He's such a douchebag it boggles the mind.  I saw him and Pat McCrory years ago at the opening of a local "eco-industrial park."  The two of them had nothing but self-congratulation ego political doublespeak to say.  I'll be surprised if he wins another term.  Cal Cunningham is an excellent candidate to take him on.  That being said, he can still use all the help and support he can get.  Already GOP SuperPACs tried to primary Cal with a more radical Democratic candidate that would never win a General Election in NC this year.  GOP has lots of money to throw at this race.  Another thing is if we can turn Tillis's seat this year, we may have a good chance of getting a good moderate Democrat through to take over Richard Burr's seat in two years as he retires.
Oh yeah. I got banned for making a joke at myself.
Oh Arizona doesn't do DST lol. I just have trouble sleeping. My stupid cat insists on being fed at fucking 3:30 am.
As long as Martha Coakley is not allowed near another ballot again.  How many races did she lose?  I've lost count.
Everyone is still rating Graham's seat as solid republican. If that changed I would certainly get involved but there are so many other races that could benefit more from my time. I'd love for cook political to be proven wrong though. If you phonebank enough maybe you can move it over to lean republican.
>McGrath doesn't need more money and is very likely to lose.   We're still 7 months from the election, and Moscow Mitch is already incredibly unpopular both in Kentucky and in the US as a whole. Kentucky kicked out an unpopular Republican governor last year, and they could be itching to do it again, so I think it's too soon to discount Amy McGrath's chances, especially since [she's polling neck-and-neck with him already](https://www.dailykos.com/story/2020/2/24/1921639/-KY-Sen-Two-Polls-Confirm-A-Toss-Up-Race-Between-Amy-McGrath-D-Moscow-Mitch-R). She's my long-shot candidate, but I supported her on her Congressional run two years ago and in honor of Elizabeth Warren, I'm supporting her again now, along with Sara Gideon in Maine and Mark Kelly in Arizona.

The Primary between Davids & Brent Welder (amongst others) was interesting to watch. Illustrates that diversity+more moderate tone was better at flipping districts than the Justice Democrats were (altho I do like many of their candidates).
You actually prompted me to stop putting off signing up to volunteer for her, so thank you! Was just the motivation I needed after a rough week in politics lol. I'm really optimistic for a blue Senate in our future!
I don‚Äôt think most of us are assuming the worst of all the other candidates supporters, just most of us have experienced enough of the worst from them. So now to move this country forward positively we are focusing on voting blue down the ticket.
I got banned for linking the dictionary definition of communism and socialism, with links.
TIL!
Remember though that the people who voted for Graham voted for a man who publicly called Trump a kook and unfit for office. They've had 4 years to watch him turn into a mindless, drooling Trump toady and some may not like it.   &#x200B;  [This episode of Into America](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL2ludG8tYW1lcmljYQ&episode=Z2lkOi8vYXJ0MTktZXBpc29kZS1sb2NhdG9yL1YwL0NSVHlYYndyclRaVjNyZTI0U0Jmcm1zSWRJUnNYR2trRlJDVUpacjR3eTg&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwik9O-j64_oAhWkdt8KHSYgApwQjrkEegQIGBAE&ep=6) talks with a Republican who is canvassing for Harrison
McConnell has been unpopular in Kentucky for years, but that doesn't stop him from getting consistently re-elected by sizable margins. He's an extremely skilled politician, and unlike Matt Bevin, he knows how to effectively nationalize a campaign against Democratic opponents in order to win. Bevin was not just unpopular, but he was an inept campaigner facing off against the son of a former popular governor and current Attorney General who successfully sued him several times... and he still barely lost. McGrath's claim to fame is... narrowly losing a winnable race in a blue wave year? It will also be a presidential year, and Trump will boost turnout immensely in McConnell's favor.  Anyway, if you want to donate to her, that's your call. Just make sure we don't let other states go unnoticed, especially Michigan.
Yes. Although I was a little sad about it because I supported Niermann in the primary, a really great man who is a teacher in the area. He ran as a moderate, and honestly was doing really well at hitting exactly the notes he needed to hit, but Welder got that roughly $400k fundraising boost from the Sanders/AOC event, and Davids got the ~$400k ad buy from EMILY'S List, so he just couldn't compete with that kind of money. But I'm glad Davids won. Her win was historic.
You suggested that i focus on races with a rosy outlook.  I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt need the outlook to be rosy, i just don‚Äôt want to be part of a campaign that resorts to low blows.   Imo that‚Äôs happening right now at the presidential level (staff, surrogates, supporters, and even some from the candidates).   Yup, i like the idea of focusing on down-ticket races.
[Paul Krugman](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/opinion/bernie-sanders-socialism.html), is that you?
Last time they voted for him was 6 years ago in 2014. Trump was not running in 2014.
That's not to mention how much McConnell's position and corruption has benefited his state.  You would not believe how much money those roads look like.  I visited the state first time last fall.  I'm certain the economy of KY would be in a worse place if it wasn't for Moscow Mitch's corruption funneling federal dollars to his state via his wife's state DOT office.  He might be disliked, but his position as SML nets his state some benefits.
Sorry I misunderstood your original comment. I thought you were disengaging all together. I personally think it‚Äôs ok to be angry, there is a lot to be angry about. I just compartmentalize it so it doesn‚Äôt spill over into other areas of my life. And definitely take breaks from social media. I also think Biden hasn‚Äôt been toxic. But I definitely see how you could feel all of it is too much toxicity in your life.

The Very Real Possibility of President Elizabeth Warren
Yeah, I think she is underestimated by most people. Probably to her benefit for now. But I think she will clinch the nomination and surprise everyone.
Electability is fiction anyway! Kerry was thought to be the most electable in ‚Äò04 and still lost. Obama was way down this time in the ‚Äò08 campaign. Trump is the most unelectable hunk of matter on the planet and he won. If we concentrate and worry about electability only, we have already lost. We need to all get behind someone who inspires us and will do a great job and do everything we can to elect them. After all, it‚Äôs OUR decision! We have all the power already!  That said, Warren is the total package. I met her in Minneapolis this week and I‚Äôve had this fire of excitement inside me since then. She spoke amazing. Her energy was electric. And she‚Äôs so stinkin‚Äô smart! I only met her for a few seconds, but she was so warm and really made me feel like she cared about me as an individual and not just part of a voting mass of people. She just has IT. I can‚Äôt think of one reason why she shouldn‚Äôt be president!
> But even more to Warren‚Äôs benefit, she is making an argument *for her electability* rather  than contending that the argument for said electability has already  been settled. That appears to be the position of the Biden camp, [including that of his own spouse](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/jill-biden-joe-biden-beat-donald-trump),  Dr. Jill Biden, who recently urged voters to ignore the qualifications  of other candidates in favor of her husband‚Äôs alleged, ethereal  ‚Äúelectability‚Äù (which has been proven, of course, by all the times he  has been president).¬†  This made me laugh, and I might be stealing the stinger at the end next time someone tells me Biden is the most "electable".
Honestly just look at the polls. Biden has stayed pretty consistent, Bernie has been trending downward, but Warren is the only candidate who has been consistently trending upward long term. If she can continue this trend it's only a matter of time.
I can't put my finger on it - my personal beliefs are more in line with Harris than anyone else. But, but, but I really like Warren and am somehow much more excited by her than anyone else.  (NB:  I'm not posting this to debate  their policies, just to support the idea that Warren can excite people even if they don't line up perfectly with her policies.)
The very real possibility that America might actually choose the best option out of the 20+ Dem candidates and not reelect a corrupt, incompetent racist rapist carnival barker?
Cool article. Thanks for the share!
As long as it is her or Bernie, I would be happy. Both would make a great president.
>We already have proof that having Trump  on the ballot isn‚Äôt enough to not only prevent Americans from showing up  to vote for him, but also isn‚Äôt enough to get other Americans to show up to vote against him.   This. We honestly can't make the same mistake like last time, running Joe Biden as the safe & electable candidate I don't think is nearly enough to beat Trump.  This why is I'm voting for Warren (and being supportive of Bernie as well) because they inspire people!
Since I started volunteering for her campaign, I truly honest to god think she's gonna do this.
[deleted]
Just subbed! I like most of the Dem candidates, but i REALLY like what Warren brings to the table. I think my dream ticket is Warren/Buttigieg. I can‚Äôt imagine the intelectual devastation those two would bring to the stage.
Agreed, her being underestimated is good for now because people don't give her any serious contention unless it is reporting on her brand, which is to release plans every few weeks, so she just has time to keep doing what she's doing at her own pace and her steady rise seems to show that this approach is paying off.
Hell, Trump is a good example of what happens when you underestimate people. So I think you‚Äôre right.
Umm, she‚Äôs the favorite according to betting markets. Not sure how she‚Äôs underrated
[deleted]
I mean...he's 0 and 2 in attempts to become president. Doesn't shout "electable" to me.
I agree actually. I tend to be more reform rather than restructure, so my policy preferences tend to be less radical... but I find the cohesiveness of her vision, the thoughtfulness and confidence of her policies, her combative but respectful tone, her exceptional communication skills, and her general optimism ‚Äî to be really appealing and inspiring.  All of these things are emblematic of qualities that make a good leader, and that‚Äôs why right now she‚Äôs winning my vote.  I want to hear her speak more about foreign policy and democratic reform though, so will be looking out for that.
Interesting.  I‚Äôm not trying to start anything, so please don‚Äôt take it as such, but I‚Äôm genuinely curious what Harris believes in that lines up with your own beliefs, to the exclusion of other candidates?  I‚Äôve personally found her statements to be a kind of compromise state between the Biden/Bennet wing of the party and the Sanders/Warren wing.  Also, as a Warren supporter, I totally agree that she‚Äôs an exciting candidate ;-)
[deleted]
I think that‚Äôs the problem with the polls right now. For many people, it‚Äôs her or Bernie. If one of the dropped out, all of those people split between Bernie and Warren would come together and be ahead of Biden
What about Yang?
she's sounds good.  But Bernie has stood for the same thing for 30 years, was NEVER a republican, Takes ZERO corporate money,  and his campaign doesn't say he will after the primaries like hers did. Bernie Sanders is our next president.
She's growing a lot, it's very possible
Yeah, and I think Trump is going to underestimate her too. She is going to make him look look like a kindergartner having a tantrum.
I think he's the result of people overestimating the American public.
So was Hillary, don't get complacent. It's better if she lays low for now otherwise as frontrunner, she'd be attacked more.
Betting markets are not a mainstream source of wisdom, and they do sometimes get it wrong.   &#x200B;  I mean, there were a handful of economists who predicted the housing bubble, housing bust, and great recession as far back as the mid 1990s but they don't get the accolades they deserve.
Likeability is only a piece; he was running against Bush, and was a war veteran so countered that dumb idea that only Republicans ‚Äúlove their country enough to fight for it.‚Äù He was bland and honestly inoffensive- and that‚Äôs what they mean by ‚Äúelectable‚Äù - not inspiring, but inoffensive enough so even the most conservative Dems will go for him.   It‚Äôs all bull but that‚Äôs what they mean when they say ‚Äúelectable.‚Äù
Well maybe he‚Äôs not so good on, say, health care, but you might just have to hold your nose.  Are you trying to say that‚Äôs not inspiring? Because Jill Biden thinks that‚Äôs inspiring.
Obama started with reform not replace and only got modest reform (important for many people but still modest).   Maybe going for it all is the better starting position.
Well said.
I PM'd you - it's a fair question but I don't care to get into it publicly.
Time and place bro. OP said they weren't interested in starting a discussion about Kamalas policies. Respect that.
[deleted]
For many people *on Reddit*.
I don‚Äôt agree with this at all and this point is commonly made in the Bernie subreddit. When you look at the aggregated polls (realclear) there is no correlation between Bernie and Warren. When either goes up, the other does not drop.  Warren and Bernie used to be to the left of liberals. Now many of their positions are shared by multiple candidates. They have become more mainstream.  We have so many great candidates. Can‚Äôt wait for the later debates when candidates will get much more time to respond.
They should just be co-presidents
My dream would be for Bernie to win the nomination, pick Warren to be his VP, then do one term and fix the country. Retire, letting Warren run, where she goes on to keep things going for two more terms.
I'm a pretty hardcore Bernie supporter, plan on volunteering/canvassing for him next year.  I get why pundits say it's a bad idea, and my political science classes tell me that it's a potential recipe for diaster, but I don't care...  A Bernie-Warren ticket is the stuff of dreams.  It'd be unstoppable
What about him? He has zero shot. The most he could hope for is a spot on someone's cabinet.
I have been listening to Warren since she was a professor, it's pretty safe to say they both have stood for the same things for over 30 years. I hope Bernie is our next president, but I will be just as happy with Warren as president.
You do realize what sub you‚Äôre in, right?
They're ALL taking big money in the general (or at least not ruling it out). You're being naive if you think otherwise. A viable general election presidential campaign is a completely different ballpark from primaries.
That is ridiculous, no one needs to make him look like a child throwing a tantrum, he does that all on his own.
Agreed. I don‚Äôt get this ‚Äúgive her more attention now because she should be the front runner. She‚Äôs not there yet in the polls and we don‚Äôt want her getting saddled with extra baggage at this stage
If he wins the nomination I will. I just find it curious that every discussion about Biden ends up with somebody saying that we should hold our nose and vote for them. It‚Äôs this weird assumption that it‚Äôs automatically supposed to be him. Aside from not being Trump, though, he has very little appeal. At least not compared to the many, many other options.
I think most of the time they‚Äôre different goals. Reform isn‚Äôt a pit stop on the way to replace, reform is the destination.  Obama was a reformer, he never wanted radical change, and as a candidate would have never backed something like Medicare for All (which I think is what you mean when you ‚Äúit all‚Äù). Healthcare reform was his principled policy position, not some compromise because he was unwilling to go bolder.  Just thought this was worth clarifying, because I think sometimes ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù candidates are incorrectly viewed as not being brave or bold enough to take the more radical positions they really want. What‚Äôs more often the case is that they truly believe that a more ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù policy is actually the best one.

Don‚Äôt do that, there‚Äôs no need for cheap shots, and this comment was called out more substantively already.
[Polls regularly show](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/) that Bernie and Warren are regularly in second and third place, respectively, behind Biden. But when you add the two together, the combined polling of both Warren and Sanders together add up to match or exceed Biden.   The problem is that this requires that Warren and Sanders are each their supporters second favorites, which is actually [shown to be false \(for now\)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lanes-are-starting-to-emerge-in-the-2020-democratic-primary/).  What really needs to happen (and I wonder if this is the strategy), is that the convention is brokered. Whomever is in 3rd place, would give their votes to 2nd place, thus beating out Biden. Assuming the trends remain, this would be either Warren or Sanders giving their delegate votes to the other, thus handing them the nomination.
I don't think having back to back presidents in office until they're 83 is a good idea.  Just put Warren in for two terms and use those 8 years to prepare the next generation of progressive leaders.
I‚Äôm also hesitant to see the internet turn on her. I‚Äôd like to see her pick up Iowa and NH before all the ‚Äúformer Bernie‚Äù supporting astroturfers turn their attention toward attacking her instead of Biden.
Absolutely agreed, I think it‚Äôs especially insane that at this point his wife said practically word for word the ‚Äúhold your nose‚Äù speech.
Not every comment needs to be replied to with hArRiS iS a BaD cAnDiDaTe (a count on which I agree with you btw)
Important to add that most of the data for second choices comes from Morning Consult but other pollsters like Pew have show different results for second choices like [this](https://twitter.com/PpollingNumbers/status/1162433238952030209)
I worry about the perception of that happening. Will Biden supporters be okay with that? Even if it's within the rules and strategizing of the convention, it seems pretty shady.
Age doesn't really matter when it comes to presidents. Having quality people as presidents is more important. Both Bernie and Warren would make great presidents.
I think the most telling response of any of his close associates was Obama telling him that he didn‚Äôt have to run. Coming from Obama, that‚Äôs practically screaming ‚ÄúDude, America doesn‚Äôt need you‚Äù.
I think they‚Äôd have quite a nerve to complain after 2016, and if they did we could just accuse them of being divisive and that they‚Äôre gonna re-elect Trump if they don‚Äôt vote for the nominee.  In other words, my response is tell them to stuff it and blame them for Trump 2020 if they refuse to vote for the nominee :)
Here‚Äôs my issue, (and maybe I‚Äôm wrong): incumbents have an advantage. Having Sanders as president for one term puts the party at a disadvantage against republicans in 2024. If he happens to die in office, it leaves us with a lame duck presidency during our first real modern progressive administration.   I don‚Äôt have any doubts he would be healthy and fit for the first term. But the second? And that leaves us at a real disadvantage that could hobble the progressive agenda for decades if we can only capture one term or get stuck with a neutered administration.   Sure, anything can happen to anyone at anytime. But age is an important factor if we are thinking eight years, not four.

California 2020 Election   [Primary Voter Pre-Registration Deadline](http://registertovote.ca.gov/): February 17, 2020    [Primary Election](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/#apply): March 3, 2020   [General Election](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/#apply): November 3, 2020
What is the rating of the pollster?
All the recent polls are showing her with big gains. Still a long way until the first caucuses. But with Liz's current momentum, I think she might be able to wrap this up on Super Tuesday.
I guess we will know if her surge is real enough when Trump starts calling her Pocahontas again. Right now he's still focused on Joe Biden.
Don't forget why we would elect her. We need to hold our politicians to their promises. They need to work for the people, not the 1%.
What do the psephologists say?   I want to believe!
Liz is kickin ass. I had no doubt in my mind when this campaign began that she would be storming to victory... She has by far the most compelling message, statesmanship, and balance between the liberal and progressive wings of the party.   Should have placed a bet on it earlier, the odds are probably too poor now.
This kills the Harris campaign.
Fivethirtyeight hasn‚Äôt rated UC Berkeley‚Äôs Institute of Governmental Studies as it only started doing polls fully independently in 2017, and Fivethirtyeight hasn‚Äôt yet incorporated those from the most recent midterm cycle into its ratings. Prior to 2017, it instead relied on joint collaboration with Field Poll (rated A+ by fivethirtyeight) for its data, which closed operations following the 2016 cycle. FWIW, The Berkeley IGS poll seems to have inherited Field Poll‚Äôs polling director, Mark DiCamillo.
Good question, not sure. I can't find a rating but did find [this](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-2020-how-poll-was-done-20190613-story.html) on how the Berkeley poll is conducted. Apparently it's email based.
Way too early for that. She‚Äôs the front runner now, so expect the next debate to be chock a block full of ‚ÄúBuT hOw R u GoNnA pAy FoR iT!?‚Äù attacks along with some ‚ÄúYou were a Republican in 1989!‚Äù from the Bernie stans.
I don't think the Pocahontas means much to anyone except those who aren't going to vote for her anyway.
Right now he's focused on impeachment, let's hope it stays that way.
Honestly, I think he's going to be focused on Biden for a while. Mostly because he got lying about Biden in perhaps the most ridiculous way possible.
I hope she comes up with a better answer for "How are you going to pay for that" because while I originally liked her attempts to reframe the question, I feel like it was lost on a lot of voters and came across as too dodgy.  If they try and go after her past record, I think she has a slam dunk there. People grow and change. Its such a silly thing to hold against her because all it shows is she is willing to change her mind if the facts tell her she is wrong.
Literally the moment she pulled ahead, she got the "LiTeRaLLy DoNaLd TrUmP" hate stuff.    The new story is that she's a mastermind who has been successfully lying for years about being anti-corruption and progressive, and is truly a Chaotic Evil Trojan Horse for the fascist regime.  Six months ago, everyone liked her because she liked Bernie's ideas and had more similar ideas of her own.  Now she's the devil incarnate.  Nobody had to tell me she was pulling ahead.  I saw it from the behavior of others.
You think he's going to break the non-aggression pact first? You might be right because she wasn't eating into his base (younger white voters) before and now she is.
>She‚Äôs the front runner now  Do you mean behind Biden? I don't want Biden to win either, and think he's weak, but he's still [leading](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html) in the [polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/). It's hard to believe, but there are lots of Biden supporters who are boomers that are quiet about it but are both familiar/comfortable with voting, and will vote for him during their primaries. These are the types that think both Bernie and Liz are too "radical." I wouldn't underestimate them at all.
[removed]
The only good answer is dodgy (for the ‚Äúwill you raise taxes for healthcare‚Äù one) because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúhave you stopped bearing your wife?‚Äù question. It comes with a leading premise and any answer that doesn‚Äôt reject that premise makes you look bad.  The myriad attacks on the wealth tax as being insufficient are pointless red herrings. Nobody asks how we‚Äôre gonna pay for another battleship, we just let the government figure it out. Deficits are a concern, but you need to manage budgets holistically, not on a program by program basis. People who raise that question are only ever doing it disingenuously and I think most of the electorate gets it by now. The Republicans certainly don‚Äôt let it get in the way of their tax cut agenda.
> People grow and change.  Certainly. But we have a choice between someone who has usually been wrong, and someone else who has always been right.
He doesn‚Äôt need to do anything. His surrogates and supporters online do all the heavy lifting at being noxious for him and they‚Äôve already been at it for a while. Sanders himself comes across fine, but he has zero capacity for enforcing message discipline within his campaign.
Clinton‚Äôs scandal involved an FBI investigation. Warren‚Äôs ‚Äúscandal‚Äù is all on the table already- ‚ÄúI have a small amount of Native American ancestry, on a few occasions several decades ago I identified with my native ancestry‚Äù. That‚Äôs the whole damn thing.
I get all that. But then you see lots of well intentioned people wondering why Warren won't be honest about her tax plan.  I think something along the lines of "Yes, under my plan you'd pay more in taxes. But under Joe's plan, you'd still be paying. Just instead of "taxes" they'd be called things like "premiums" and "deductibles". I want to overhaul how we do healthcare in this country. And so instead of focusing on things like "tax increases" I want to focus on what matters: how much you the American people have to pay for your healthcare. Under my plan, those costs will go down" might help address the question while still hitting the root of the problem
I wouldn't say Warren has always been right, but at the same time Trump hasn't "usually been wrong" he has almost always been wrong. So its still a no-brainier of a choice.
Oh you meant the moderate dems will say that.
There‚Äôs your sound byte for anti warren ads next year though. Just saying overall cost goes down isn‚Äôt dishonest
Yup, specifically Biden and, once he falls off, Harris and Klobuchar if they're still around.
Bruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders . I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.
Best wishes to Bernie for a quick recovery! Glad to see positive energy rather than having allies kick each other to get ahead.
Class act.  As a Bernie supporter, gotta respect Warren for her well wishes. I hope their allyship doesn't end anytime soon
For those who may have seen information on Sen. Sanders canceling a TV ad buy in Iowa, this is to reduce the cross-over between news of this incident and association with his campaign. Canceling the ad is not a sign that he's dropping out, it's common campaign strategy. Thanks to Demcord for the explanation.  In regards to the Sen. Sanders' health, 100% with Sen. Warren, definitely wishing him a speedy and strong recovery.
While I want Warren to beat Bernie, I don't want it to be like this.   I wish him a speedy recovery and a return to the campaign trail.
Awww @ the comments. That is the unity we need. Get better soon Bernie, we're all sending good vibes.   Even the conspiracy folks are saying the "MSM" will "immediately abandon Warren for Biden if Sanders drops out." I think this is their way of showing solidarity too XD, and I accept.
As a Bernie supporter this warms my heart.
Oh no, what happened to Bernie?
I hope Bernie is back on his feet soon. I‚Äôm a Warren supporter and Bernie is my very close second (I‚Äôve donated to both and I volunteered with his campaign in 2015).   He and Warren move towards basically the same goal in two very different ways. We need both of them, especially Bernie‚Äôs firebrand, man-of-the-people approach, to effectively push the progressive agenda.
It's a good opportunity to use his healthcare bill to talk about M4A.   >$15,000 for a stent! With M4A, this would have been covered in full.   God Speed, Bern!
Get well soon, Bernie. It won't be the same till you're back campaigning.
We love you Bernie!  And hope you feel better soon!  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be talking about making healthcare and college education a right to uplift our entire nation and not just the wealthy.    Warren supporters and Bernie fans are all family.
As some one who supported Bernie in 2016 (Warren team now) - I am sending lots of love and well wishes to the man who changed the political conversation for the better. We want you back in the primaries Bernie, your voice is very important and it‚Äôs not the same without you.
Bernie, fight against this heart problem like you fight against the 1%!  You've got this!  Speedy recovery
A perfect, classy tweet from Warren. Bernie's my #1 but Warren continues to impress me with her dedication to not go low to win.
We love you here at Team Warren, Bernie! Get well soon!‚ô•Ô∏è
Warms my heart to see that people aren‚Äôt being ghoulish about this.  Sanders is a firebrand advocate for progressive values and neither the primaries nor the Senate would be the same without him.  I hope he gets better soon.
There is a lot of salt in the comments below. Twitter needs downvote buttons.
Hang in there, Bernie. We still got a lot of wealth to redistribute.
Democrats really get along well. They don't talk and argue over each other and get so divisive the way republican candidates typically do. This was kind of her.
Here here. Get well soon Bernie!
Nothing from Bailey? Wow Bailey so toxic /s
This made me happy.
I hope he gets well soon
A song for today...and everyday...  www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdFft_aQDIY
Get well soon Bernie!!
Tremendous respect for both candidates, and hope Bernie can recover and continue fighting for what he believes in.
Class act, President Warren is.   Warren/Sanders 2020
[removed]
I feel the same. Cheers!
Their "allyship" should blossom into a co-ticket.  Only think I'm not sure of is, should it be Warren / Sanders or Sanders / Warren.
If Warren wins the primary, she should announce that Bernie will be her Secretary of the Treasury. The same goes for Sanders with Warren. That's how you reach out to both sides of the progressive base.
[deleted]
Agreed, and I agree with your username. Cheesesteaks ARE better with onions.
Hey just a quick question! I‚Äôm originally a Bernie supporter but absolutely love Warren as well. Is there any particular reason why I should support warren over Bernie? Thank you!
It‚Äôs weirdly heartwarming coming from the conspiracy folks.
We must be reading different comments...? All the comments I see are calling this manipulative or being negative...
Went to the hospital for chest pains. Had surgery to get stents on his heart. It's a minor surgery though
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/02/4bf1660a-e522-11e9-a331-2df12d56a80b_story.html In case you also wanted to read about it!
I agree! His copay will probably be minimal with his government insurance, though. Should still have the billing breakdown!
I know he doesn't like to talk about himself much, but he definitely should.
Exactly what I was going to say so I‚Äôll just upvote your comment instead.
I know Harris did too. It makes me wonder if Trump would have done the same in the Republican primary.
Right? I've heard a very few ppl talk about Russian Warren trolls, but I don't think we really have any...? Or else they'd be all over this, being ghoulish.
Good place to work out the ol' mute button muscle.
The politicians, anyway
He's the attack dog of the campaign.
I laughed harder than I should have at this comment
I saw some implications like that in the  r/politics thread but according to the most recent Morning Consult poll, 30% of Bernie's supporters have Biden as their second choice and 28% have Warren. I don't think it is wise for us to act like Bernie voters will just come to us if he is forced to drop out.   Regardless though, there is not a worse look we can give right now than to look like we are excited to be taking his supporters over this. It is more reason for this split to continue.   I hope Bernie gets better and is back on the campaign trail soon. He adds so much to the conversation and let's win because we have the candidate who will be the best President, not because time is running out on Bernie.
I would rather not speculate on these things. It's possible that a surge could happen, but this is the last way I would want any kind of surge to happen. Don't forget, Warren herself is also a septuagenarian and isn't immune from possible health scares.
We cannot afford to lose both of them in the Senate so one of them can be mothballed in the office of the VP.
I'm hoping whichever of the two who doesn't get the nomination stays in the Senate to be an ally.
To be crassly political - it's highly unlikely either of them would want a ticket with two (fairly) old white lefties.   Most likely Sanders or Warren would try to diversify the ticket by adding a younger POC from a state/region they need a boost in - VPs are usually selected to create balance on the ticket, rather than double-down on the qualities of the nominee. VP picks also tend to be politicians who are okay to playing second fiddle to the bigger personality at the top of the ticket. Neither Warren or Sanders really fit the bill for each other.
This is a terrible idea practically. Your VP is all about balancing your weaknesses. Sanders is the one person running who doesn't meet that standard.
I'll say Sanders/Warren of course, but I'm happy with either.  Idk how likely it is tho because they're both progressive senators from New England.  Honestly I don't think it matters, it would be a killer ticket and a true match made in heaven.  (For anyone wondering, I say Sanders/Warren mainly because I think Bernie would do a great job serving for one term and then "passing the buck" to Liz in 2024 for her to serve.  We could get three terms of progressive presidents out of this)
And then Kamala Harris can be their AG.
Seriously? Come on.
I read that as cheesecake the first time and was about to go **off**!
[Here ya go!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/cjcguc/the_case_for_warren_from_the_left/) But keep in mind they're both awesome candidates and will make great presidents -- it's like asking whether you prefer ice cream with sprinkles or whipped cream, while you might have a preference both are delicious!
Bernie/Warren supporter here too! In addition to what Amy wrote, if things like a strong Medicare for All or more robust environmental plan are important to you, it's actually better to have Bernie in the Senate fighting for that- after all, legislatively speaking, all a President does is sign whatever passes through Congress into law.  The President also chooses cabinet members, and Warren by all accounts made [excellent hiring decisions at the CFPB](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/20/20867899/elizabeth-warren-cfpb-founding-plans-obama-president).
Right? Definite warm and fuzzies.
Those must be new...
I'd avoid characterizing the surgery as minor/major until the Sanders campaign officially announces what occurred. When it comes to medical diagnosis, the difference between minor and major is filled to the brim with anecdotal information and only those who understand a specific patient's medical history and current diagnostics will be able to give any real answer to the question.
I really hope he‚Äôs ok and I think he‚Äôll recover, but there‚Äôs no ‚Äòminor‚Äô surgery for 78 year olds.
We can if we elect a new wave of AOCs. We need to duplicate the Squad en masse.
Completely disagree, having both of them on the ticket is way more valuable considering there isn't that much of a significant demographic overlap of the two candidates core bases.  Additionally, sending a unified progressive message is incredibly important, either one of them with a more centrist VP isn't doing anyone any favors. With either one as VP, they could also do the very important work of whiping votes in the Senate.
My guess is Warren goes Booker or Castro for VP and Harris for AG, and Sanders probably picks Harris or Booker.
Booker as VP. He's younger, a POC, and has executive experience which Warren lacks.  Harris as AG. I don't like here since she doesn't seem like a leader (lack of clear vision) and was a prosecutor, but the first doesn't matter for AG and the second is great.  Gabbard as Secretary of State, because she has the opposite of neocon foreign policy objectives, but still ha balls.  Buttigieg as some kind of ambassador.  Williamson can lead the prayer dinner.
[deleted]
It had autocorrected to cheesecake first, actually. I'd be open to trying a savory one with caramelized onions though.
Nah, those comments were there from the beginning.
From what I've seen they said the surgery is finished and Bernie is in high spirits
PCI: Coronary stenting is one of the most common procedures in the United States. It involves feeding a wire up the femoral artery in the groin and into the heart, then inserting and expanding metallic coils to hold open the arteries that supply blood to the heart.  It is not a surgical procedure at all. It is a minor procedure. This is fact. Also he had a single vessel disease which is also meaninful.  I agree that there is more to come out but I think the basics are as above.
I'm pretty concerned that the campaign is downplaying this. The fact that their statements don't sound like he's definitively returning, is really worrying.
I'm just sitting here hoping good Senators like Markey don't get primaried. My hope is that it would be happening from the left and not from the center.
It‚Äôs pretty rare that the VP comes from the primary competition. This time might be different since the primary field is particularly qualified and diverse (and senatorial, which is also somewhat unusual)... so I think we should expand our idea as to who would be considered for VP or cabinet positions.  Democrats have built a very deep bench over the past few years, across federal and state offices, and so there‚Äôs a wealth of people to choose from.
Lost me at Gabbard.
Do you even know which Clinton you‚Äôre talking about?
The procedure is minor and routine but even if that‚Äôs all it is, he is going to be on anticoagulants and probably beta blockers for months until the stent site is fully healed. Those are harsh and draining.  I really hope this doesn‚Äôt impact his ability to sustain a demanding campaign schedule, but I know how tired my (much much younger) husband was.
Again, any statement about his health outside of the campaign is going to be based on anecdotal information at best. I wouldn't take any stock in the political rumor mill, especially not during a campaign (when rumors are amplified exponentially).
Yeah, I don't get that. Like, I get that Joe Kennedy wants to move up the ladder and all, but why not wait a little longer to see if Warren becomes president or ends up in some other prominent position and run in the special election?
AFAIK if they‚Äôre gonna primary a Democrat, Justice Democrats mainly take on Dems who have a tendency to vote with the Republicans, or places with heavily left leaning demographics.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but:  https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/09/21/joe-kennedy-iii-campaign-kickoff-ed-markey
[deleted]
He will be on dual antiplatelets which is different from anticouaglants. Anticoagulants are reserved for patients with coinciding Atrial fibrilliation. The medications themselves will not play a significant part in this. I dont know what medications Bernie usually takes. He may well be on a few of these already.
Good call.
That‚Äôs what I was referring to. He‚Äôs polling well too. I have nothing against Kennedy, and I think he would make a good Senator, but bit unfortunate.
You can start by going somewhere else. A thread about the health of a human being isn‚Äôt the place to spout ridiculous and uniformed ideas about someone else.
Oh, gotcha. I was reading "get primaried" as having someone challenge the seat, not necessarily win.
You win.  Edit: sorry I just hate what happened in Haiti...
Elizabeth Warren lands 24 new Iowa endorsements after debate, giving her the largest number of state legislator endorsements than any other candidate.
This is how you get it done folks. Warren's racking up delegates. Hope this continues to snowball into further support in other key primary states.
 Can someone explain why endorsements matter?  I don‚Äôt get why it would change voting at all.
One question I have is what happens to the endorsements of low polling candidates, when they withdraw?
She's got a plan!
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   Caucus: February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
[removed]
This has nothing to do with delegates.
As in Super Delegates?
If you're a fan or supporter of a given politician and you're having trouble deciding between candidates, the endorsement of that politician could be enough to swing you to that candidate.  You have to remember that the vast majority of voters are not political nerds like we are.
They either endorse someone else, or do nothing.
Good Bot
I think you‚Äôre lost
Cool story bro.
Super Delegates aren't really very important anymore under the new rules. Endorsement is more about local people you may be more familiar with saying that they like someone. There are some people who don't pay a lot of attention nationally who might look at it
As far as I understand it these are pledged delegates not super delegates (with the exception of Mary Wolfe who is a member of Congress) but I could be wrong. The main difference between the two being that pledged delegates are laypersons on the local level like activists and city council members and stuff like that. Superdelegates are senators, members of Congress, former president and the like. Regardless, the more delegates in your pocket the more likely superdelegates will take you seriously. This is definitely a good sign for Warren.  Edit: correction I'm wrong.  This explains it better. https://www.usa.gov/election
[deleted]
That or the candidate endorses when they drop out, and their endorsers will often follow their lead.
Super delegates vote if the first vote at the convention does not result in a winner is my understanding.
I wouldn't say they're not important, they will decide a close election if it is close. There are just fewer of them than there were in 2016, for the most part.
> As far as I understand it these are pledged delegates  Pledged delegates are what you are awarded in the primary. These are local political figures saying publicly that they think Elizabeth Warren should be president. Some of them will attend campaign events with Warren in Iowa and ask for votes on her behalf.
Thanks for the explanation. If Warren becomes President, I hope she removes the concept of pledged and super delegates. It‚Äôs un-democratic and not aligned with progressive values.
State and local level representatives are the ones that actually knock on people's doors to speak one on one about the issues. They often maintain these relationships over the course of the voter's lives and the politician's careers. You don't need to watch Meet The Press or read the New York Times to like the friendly person who knocked on your door. But if you're on a first name basis with a given politician, it has a certain weight when he or she endorses someone you haven't met yet.  AOC is also a powerful endorsement, but in a different way. Certainly more people across the nation have heard of AOC, but within the state of Iowa, fewer people have actually met AOC, or had a conversation with AOC than have met or talked with these state and local politicians.
It gives local cache for national/statewide candidates. Especially in a "nationalistic" place like Iowa, this matters quite a bit.
AOC is also polarizing and doesn't bring in many new voters to Bernie. She'll energize the current ones and bring in some press, but if you were hardcore into AOC, then you're most likely a Bernie supporter already. It's one reason why Warren's campaign brushed it off.
You are correct. And that hasn't happened in a half century or so‚Äîand never since modern primaries started.
They actually won't be used unless there is a brokered convention.
Ah. Thanks for the clarification
Under the First Amendment (freedom of association), the Federal and State governments have no authority to tell the parties how to select their candidates. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Democratic_Party_v._Jones
I agree with you 100% and thanks for bringing that up. I can't for the life of me understand why we do it this way. Maybe someone can chime in here? Specifically, why don't the people vote for the nominee after early primaries/caucuses and before the general election? Why do we give delegates so much power?
I don‚Äôt disagree, but there is a common misconception that political parties are democratic and / or government organizations. They are not. They are private organizations that operate under their own rules and bylaws.  A candidate could pledge to have the federal government interfere in the operations of the political parties, but I‚Äôd suspect they wouldn‚Äôt want to alienate the party that is trying to get them elected.
Aren‚Äôt the Superdelegates what really killed Bernie in 2016 because they almost all went to Clinton regardless of state results?
And this is the real answer. These are people in the community and part of the community. They aren‚Äôt splashy names, they are the names that make and build the ground game. They are the names that know where to go if the power goes out and you need a generator. They are the names that can call in favors, that know what stump speeches should emphasize. They are the names that can call in a favor if something happens. Having been part of a few county level political meetings and having been ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in local elections these people are extremely important. Especially in caucus states.
It seems she is laying the groundwork for this though.
In the old days, the Democratic nominee was chosen by party elders in a smoke filled room at the convention. Reforms in the mid 20th century made the process more democratic.  Then in 1972, primary voters nominated George McGovern, who was basically the Bernie Sanders of his time. He was an anti-war progressive, he was beloved by college kids and the left, he got his ass kicked so hard by Nixon that the party elders were like, "maybe don't let the voters make all the decisions here". Hence the super delegate system.
Well..... One Devil's Advocate argument is that if the GOP had superdelegates, that would have stopped Trump.  *shrug
The delegates are given so much power so the DNC in essence can choose the nominee and not the people
Generally speaking, though, all of our laws and customs are based around the idea of a two party system. If the parties don't behave democratically, then we do not have free and fair elections. If the parties do not behave democratically then we are not a democracy.
No. This is a really unpopular sentiment on reddit but bernies loss didn‚Äôt have much to do with superdelegates. The controversy came because some news stations were including supers in their delegate totals while the race was going on. Some Bernie supporters claim that this had a chilling effect on his support later on in the race but I personally haven‚Äôt seen anything to support this.  An argument can be made either way but from what I‚Äôve seen the supers didn‚Äôt have much of an effect in 2016, and historically I believe they‚Äôve never tried to unseat the candidate who got popular support in the primary.
Yes and no. All the superdelegates that said they were going to vote for ~~Warren~~ Hillary before the polls counted as endorsements. That had major influence to convince people that she was most electable. However, Bernie losing at the ballot box was the biggest factor and that was not changed by superdelegates.  Source: https://www.vox.com/2016/5/6/11597550/superdelegates-bernie-sanders-clinton  While it did convince the DNC to make some changes for 2020, I don't like how Bernie's campaign went about it. They villafied the party, making it extremely difficult to unite behind Hillary. And now, there are legit Bernie supporters villafying Warren. I do think the majority will back Warren if she wins the nomination, but his campaign should focus on uniting; not dividing. His rebellion from joining the party isn't exactly helpful to the party as a whole.
No, she had the pledged delegates regardless.  You could argue that the massive amount of supers who endorsed her may have killed enthusiasm by some of his otherwise-would-be-supporters, but I don't think removing them would have changed the outcome.
Prob smart.
Thank you for responding. That's very interesting.
Just FYI, you said "Warren" instead of "Hilary" in your first paragraph. ;)
Whoops! Thanks. I've got Warren on the brain.
No prob. We all do here :)
Me, my mother and Elizabeth in Iowa.
Awesome that you got to meet her.  Also has anyone ever told you that you look like Bret "The Hitman" Hart? This is a compliment.
Your hair is very legit!
Wow, Elizabeth has some really long hair.
Username checks out.  Also, I‚Äôm super jealous you got to meet her.
Look at mom just cheesin! Warren is inspirational, she'll get my vote and I'll push every single person I know to vote for her too. Warren is for the people!
Happy you guys got to meet her!

I'm in Warren's camp.  I'd be thrilled to vote for her in the primary, and in the general if she gets the nomination,  if Bernie gets the nomination though, I'd be very happy to vote for him. If Biden gets the nomination, I'll vote for him, but I wouldn't be happy about it.
The username checks out! Haha, I'm definitely jelly, I've donated to her campaign but I wish I could do more. This is a grassroots campaign, no money from corporate donors. This is the people mobilizing and organizing to create a better country, it's energizing honestly.

"President Elizabeth Warren" is trending on Twitter for the first time!
Cool! What does that mean?  Did she do or say a thing? What did i miss?
Mrs President has a real nice ring to it
Top level gifs.
But hopefully not the last...
I love to see this sub growing.
Huh?
[removed]
It's because of this powerful and catchy line she sprung at Netroots Nation, a progressive convention:  >To anyone out there who is working in this \[border patrol\] system, understand... You abuse immigrants, you physically abuse immigrants, you sexually abused immigrants, you fail to get them medical care that they need, you break the law of the United States of America. **And Donald Trump may be willing to look the other way, but President Elizabeth Warren will not.** ([lnk](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1150185624680505345))
In her Netroot talk she said, "If you abuse immigrants, if you physically or sexually abuse immigrants, if you deny immigrants medical care... you break the laws of the United States of America.  President Trump may be willing to look the other way, but President Elizabeth Warren will NOT!"  [https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1150185624680505345](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1150185624680505345)
Hopefully a clever social media manipulation tactic on her team's part.
Madam President
You have a weird habit of deleting your post history. This is a tactic often employed by troll accounts and scrounging through your deleted history you make no mention of your family history ever before in the three years of you've had this account. You also post the The_Donald, Conspiracy, and have one post in The Great Awakening. I am just really skeptical to your story because there's no consistency in your post history that comports with what you are saying.
she didnt use it on her college applications sooo
It's great that she is acknowledging this! Some people seem to think that you can disregard the law when someone is coming from somewhere else. "The law of the land" is supposed to mean something.
No, it's not a manipulation tactic it was in response to her Netroot speech. [https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1150185624680505345](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1150185624680505345)
No, she just gave an awesome speech at netroots nation. Let's not spread memes like this.
I‚Äôd prefer it‚Äôs not a trick tbh.
I like that one better.
Pelosi is Madam Speaker. I say we roll with it.
I‚Äôm down with it
It's the name of a show on CBS. Madam Secretary/President. It's basically an alternative timeline where Hillary Clinton becomes President. Not as good as *The West Wing*, but still enjoyable.   You can start at Season 6 with no problem catching up. Preview: https://youtu.be/gQoSHKEWOso
I think you're being too kind to that poster, who isn't really that interested in Warren's background. Being upset about how she handled the Native American status is one thing, but these points are just trying to paint a false picture of her  > Warren, a person with so much more means and wealth ... enhance her already privileged life  The privilege of having her father out of work due to a heart attack? The wealth of having the family car repossessed? The means of her family not being able to afford college? Must have very broad definitions of these terms  > I was never accepted to Harvard  She never attended there, so hey, that's a similarity between that poster and Warren. She was "only" a professor at Harvard
[deleted]
You‚Äôre acting like calling yourself the next president is some insidious mind control tactic and not something normal that every candidate ever has done.
Meh. This is the world we live in now.
I never said you were a Donald Trump supporter. I said you post to The_Donald, Conspiracy, and The Great Awakening. Those are all subs where there is a dubious amount of troll accounts and even here you deleted your comment after it was removed.   Your posting history connotes a suspicious comportment and I'm just really skeptical as to most things people say online without verification. It's pretty easy to dig through your post history regardless of if you think deleting your comments makes them unreadable. You've never mentioned any of this history elsewhere and have a history of engaging in conspiratorial beliefs. In the interest of transparency, I'm just putting that out there because if you believe in accountability then you should lead on it instead of dancing in the shadows.
YUUUUUP. Isn‚Äôt this exactly what we wanted Democrat‚Äôs to do? To finally be brave and sophisticated enough to outmatch Trump‚Äôs strategy?
Not that I don‚Äôt like aggressive strategies but I like when she has jumps in support that are public driven. More sustainable.
[deleted]
A *5 year old* is sophisticated enough to outmatch Trump's strategy..
Hear me out. Of *course* you like it more. I would too. Just like how I'd like to believe she doesn't have to pop speed pills at her age to help manage an insane campaign schedule 24/7 (pardon the provocative image). But I'm not naive. We're trying to win an election in the 21st century. I wouldn't begrudge her for employing underhand tactics to get ahead so long as it's not illegal or malicious. It's gamesmanship. If she doesn't play it, someone else will and benefit from it. Which would be unfortunate, because it's a game I want her to win.
And you haven't defended yourself because you're obfuscating your own history. I actually don't care about your estimation of Warren's character because that is not what I'm raising doubt on. It's you. You have a shady posting history and one that is worthy of skepticism. Regardless of Warren, I would think that and it just happens that we bumped into each other here.
And guess what, it works
I'm not liking how much you're referring to the election/politics as a game. It's not a fucking game. This shit is real.
Those kinda games make you lose instantly though once you get found out. Unless you‚Äôre the party of completely morally bankrupt assholes. We‚Äôre not (see:  Franken).  P.S. I‚Äôm in no way equating Warren and Franken.
[deleted]
It doesn't so many things had to go Trump's way for him to win, not the least of which being Hillary "30 years of propaganda baggage" Clinton discouraging lots of people from voting or into voting 3rd party.
I'm not sure what's offending you about that. Winning is all that matters. You can't help people in politics or real life unless you win the election first.
franken was thrown under the bus
I know what I need to know about Warren. For someone who claims concern for justice or equal rights there's little to nothing in your post history that actually demonstrates advocacy or understanding of racism against Native Americans or First Nation people. You don't get to the be on the sidelines of injustice and claim your history as shield when there's nothing in it to suggest understandings of Tribal sovereignty, unfulfilled treaties, and current abuses of Native land.   Once again you have tried to delete your history as if that makes it any harder for me to not see what you've posted. When you submit things to this site it is saved regardless of you deleting it. Trying to obfuscate yourself and deflect is just further evidence of a lack of good faith on your part. I'd allow you room for growth and understanding but it seems like you are unwilling to take it.
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) introduced legislation on Wednesday that would rescind 20 Medals of Honor awarded to U.S. soldiers who slaughtered hundreds of Lakota Indians ‚Äî mostly women and children ‚Äï in the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890."
Good. They should have never been awarded.
Good! War Criminals shouldn‚Äôt have medals.
Trump will probably pardon them.
So proud of my fellow Okie standing up for Native Americans
Fox and Friends will talk about this tomorrow morning, and within 15 minutes @realDonaldTrump will tweet:  > "Effective immediately I am ordering my Generals to RECIND the medals of the FAKE HERO John McCain!  And give them to Eddie Gallagher instead!"
I hope she doesn't take Booker Dewitts away
Good
hell ya!
This seems like an odd thing to focus on right now. What's the strategy here?
This is.... fantastic. Japan should take notes.
Focus on now imo
Wait, you can rescind them?! If so, we should definitely do it, and then get at all these other so-called heroes who have committed undue atrocities.
Yeah, but unfortunately with the republican senate, this probably only has a .098% chance of passing.
[removed]
[deleted]
Indians? Like from India?    100 percent agree with this.
This is also a good way of making up for the whole ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù thing.  Very smart political move.
In other news Donald Trump is trying to figure out how to bring 20 dead war criminal medal of honor recipients on the campaign trail with him.
What about Comstock's though?
It‚Äôs Thanksgiving time.
She keeps moving on.   For instance she wrote a bill to make it so people can buy hearing aids over the counter.  She got it passed with a Republican senate and got it signed into law by Trump even though the NRA, for some reason, opposed the bill.  The price of hearing aids will go down from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars next year.
I think she can handle both, tbh.
She doesn't like attacking people directly so I feel like she does things like this as a repudiation. So this more in response to Trump than a focus on the past.
Yeah, this definitely comes across as grandstanding. I don't see this as necessary and will probably just lead to more "Pocahontas" type attacks.
Seems like she can take care of both ;-)
Please no, we don't need another trail of tears
Ah, got it.
> the NRA, for some reason  For some reason, indeed.  Like, WAT?  Maybe they figure people with untreated hearing loss will be socially isolated and thus more likely to drift into paranoid gun purchases?
If all they have are Pocahontas attacks, they're only showing off their own vulnerability.
That was my first thought too.
[deleted]
Yea, it‚Äôs time to rescind those medals.
Considering this was first introduced by Deb Haaland in the House, it's not just history to the Native American community.  It's a simple bill making an official retraction of honors awarded for an atrocity.  It's not holding up important Senate business and since it doesn't matter **to you** let people for whom it does matter get the retraction they deserve.
Fair enough, but I feel like the attack ammo this will give the right will outweigh the good progressives will feel about it. I mean the attack ads practically write themselves, "Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren wants to desecrate veterans by stripping them of their medals." It'll turn into the "she wants to erase history" type attack that's used for Confederate statues.
It‚Äôs not about making progressives ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù, it‚Äôs about correcting an inexcusable error, and lending further credence to the *still existing* plight of native Americans. I‚Äôm sorry, but there‚Äôs no statute of limitations on doing the right thing.
If the end result of Trump's racism was that Democrats became scared to support America's minority populations that would truly be the worst possible result.    It's long past time to stop proactively accommodating the desires of racists and sexists and homophobes because we're scared of what they might think.  Let them get fired up and vote to protect war criminals.  We're not going to do anything worth doing without pissing off those people.
Yes.  On the other hand, the people who react to that stuff are the ones who would never vote for Warren anyway.
I feel like most people know of the battle of wounded knee as just another battle that the US won (if at all). That's all I remembered about it until today. Yes, that shows my ignorance but, I don't think I'm specifically ignorant. The only reason I looked into it was because I'm already a Warren supporter. I'd imagine to a bunch of people this will look odd in a bad way. Then again, it shows character to do something because your believe it is right and not because of how it looks.
Warren is in second place in California according to new Los Angeles Times Poll
Nice! Pretty sure climbing is where you want to be this early in the primary season.
Important to note, not only is she in second place, when you combine voters for which candidates are first or second choice, she slides past Biden into 1st.
Third straight poll to show her in second, let's GO!
I think something important to see is that she also has a lot of support as a second choice candidate. I wonder how many of those people for whom she is a second choice have her there because they were worried about her viability as a candidate. It's possible that as more polls like this come out, people will see that she has a real shot a winning this and move her into their first choice candidate. Idk. Time will tell.  Also, I kinda feel bad for Kamala having a rough time in her home state, but as a Californian, it was kinda expected. We don't have a lot of sentimental home town pride for our politicians, as a general rule. And also, she's from NorCal, so those of us in SoCal are even less likely to support her on a home state pride basis.
The "On the Issues" polling was pretty illustrating in terms of the differences between the frontrunners -- Warren supporters want her to tax the wealthy more than anything, Bernie supporters want Medicare-for-all, and Biden supporters don't really seem too enthused about anything. The good thing for Warren is that taxing the wealthy seems to be much more popular than Medicare for all.
As people learn more about her and her policies they support Warren. People support Biden because hey recognize his name, but pretty soon that‚Äôs going to fade (even more)
Those plans are getting her some well-deserved momentum! She‚Äôs been my favorite all along, but I was nervous about how idiot voters would feel about her compared to Trump. She‚Äôd obviously ‚Äúwin‚Äù the debates, but so did Clinton. I don‚Äôt care anymore. She‚Äôs too perfect to pass on. I‚Äôve been solidly behind her for a few weeks, made my first donation of the year to her, and it looks like I‚Äôm not the only one! She‚Äôs the President we need to correct course in this country.
This is amazing as California has pushed up their primary this election year.  Should Liz take second place or even win California, she will take home a ton of delegates and will convince those on the fence that yes, with their support, Liz can win!
I've never met anyone who actually likes Joe Biden. Why is he the top of all the polls?
As a Californian I will do my part to push to first.  Fantastic thing is 2020 we have moved our primary up from June to March 3rd, so the biggest bastion of democratic electoral votes in the nation will actually have a say in determining the nominee!
Good. I'm glad other people besides me are finally starting to take her seriously. Honestly I'm tired of Biden at this point, he's old news and he keeps making the news for really weird stuff like telling a 13 year olds brothers to "keep guys away from her" gross.
>Harris 13%  Damn, that's her own state üôÑ
as a european, i was let down with Al Gore and the Monkey happened. You guys voted him a 2nd time and i couldnt believe it. Then Obama was the promised one but nope. Red Senate went mad and branded him as the literal devil - wtf? Then Bernie Sanders made some sense and Hillary couldnt possible lose to Trump.  Yeah, guess again. Guys, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush Jr., Obama, Trump. there were only 2 guys who really had their heart on the right side. Please dont fuck it up this time, i cant defend you anymore, all my friends, coworkers, colleagues hate the US or make jokes. I love the US and what it represents but the last 30 years man .. fuck. its hard.
Is there any possibility her and Bernie might end up being running mates. For Pres and VP
On twitter Bernie supporters attack all other candidates atm even Warren. This divide will give Trump the win plus he will rig the election anyways.
[removed]
Yeah I'm really hoping that she edges out Bernie come voting season. That way I can feel comfortable putting my full support behind her.
I like to watch the prediction markets, and Warren's trajectory there is extremely encouraging  https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election
It is!
Likely the Bernie supporters that will vote for her if he goes out. Once one of them goes out the other will beat Biden and take the nomination
We are one year off and Biden is already slipping in the polls...If people seriously think the debates are going to help him, lol
Pretty much everyone I know who is smart likes Warren best but worries about "electability".  The "electability" thing is a trap. Nobody can predict that. Everyone should vote for who they like best in the primary, then also vote for whoever the nominee is in the general. Is it really that difficult?  Warren 2020
not since ol' Reagan!
Tax the wealthy has broad bipartisan support. Trump actually ran on increasing taxes on the rich if you can remember that, but of course it was a lie. But the point is that even many republicans like the idea. I think any Dem should run explicitly on a tax the rich message to get back some of those Obama-Trump voters and to pay for the progressive programs we all want.  M4A will be much harder. If we've learned anything from Obamacare and the GOP attempts to repeal, it's that people fear any change in their healthcare provider especially when someone else is forcing them to change.  That's why I've come around to the idea that the best course to get something passed and not generate massive blowback like happened in 2010 is have an optional opt-in system. There are a bunch of plans like Medicare X, Medicare buy in, etc that go in this direction and I could see them passing through a 51 or 52 seat Dem Senate in 2021.  Another factor for me was that we saw how the government screwed up on the ACA exchange websites. Imagine if Dems try M4A and it has similar issues. It'd be a disaster both for people who need care and politically. Going slower with opt-in choices allows time to build up the system and prepare gradually to expand coverage while giving those who need it most the ability to join right away.  So I totally understand supporting M4A as your starting point like Warren does, but I'm expecting there won't be the votes to pass it come 2021. And like Obama had to drop the public option in 2009/10 in order to get the preexisting conditions and expanded Medicare coverage, I expect any Dem President will need to settle for what can pass through Congress, specifically the Senate. And of course this assumes Dems even have the votes to kill the filibuster!
If we pass a wealth tax and anti-corruption laws, M4A will be a walk in the park. I don't like that Warren isn't committed to the single payer bill yet, but I understand the strategy of emphasizing other priorities.
Yes, he could really be the Jeb Bush of 2020 primary season.
>I don‚Äôt care anymore. She‚Äôs too perfect to pass on.  More of this please! We need to all stop catering to what stupid people want and organize to vote in smart people who will do good things. People like Warren CAN and WILL win if we do this. We'll always have more of the same if we let the dumbest among us set the stage and then follow their lead.
She had decent name recognition, so I was concerned that she opened up as low in polling as she did in the first couple months.   Her steady climb is a great sign, as it shows a cementing supporter base, rather than one that latches on for name or initial likability.
Double-edged sword, it necessarily means less money for the general. Also less money needed for the primary, hah. Maybe it works out the same as before?
He's familiar, and the MSM loves him.
I feel the same about Bernie. He's old and busted. Time to make room for someone new.
[removed]
Your feelings are not dissimilar from those of many people who live here.
Running mates are usually picked to 'balance the ticket'. She'll run with someone from the South or a western state, and someone maybe a bit less progressive. Someone like Inslee, Hickenlooper, Abrams, or Castro.
>On twitter  I promise you that your life will improve if you never look at Twitter again
The bot armies are out in force already.   Everyone who's surprised, stand on your head and recite the alphabet backward.
That is a racist joke.
And hopefully he concedes early enough that their votes aren‚Äôt split when it really matters.
I hope she edges out Biden and we have Warren vs. Bernie (two faves!).
I have to remind myself that it's not a horse race, and I am not trying to pick the winner.
I‚Äôm back and forth on the two, but, after Sanders‚Äô speech yesterday, what makes you currently prefer Warren over him?  I‚Äôm just curious
That really depends on who is left by primary day next year.  We have almost a year to go and lots of things can change in that time.  Beating Biden is by no means a certainty given his renown/general popularity. By June of next year poll numbers for the major candidates will look extremely different.
I'm not so sure. Currently on RCP Biden's at 32.2% and Warren and Bernie are collectively at 27.6%. Even if you add in some of the lesser supported progressives like Gabbard, Yang and Castro they only rise to 29.6% to Biden's 32.2%. It really depends where the supporters of candidates like Harris, Buttigieg, O'Rourke, Klobuchar, Booker and Bennet land. Collectively those candidates account for 22% of the electorate on RCP.
> Pretty much everyone I know who is smart likes Warren best but worries about "electability". >  >   Just remind them that Trump won. He was supposed to be the anti-electable candidate. The typical rules for electability are out the window.
Just tell them that Al Gore and John Kerry had "electability", whereas Barack Obama (black guy with a terrorist's name) and Donald Trump did not have electability.
I think more will be needed before M4A becomes politically viable to pass through Congress.   We need to fix campaign financing so the Kochs can't run tens of millions of anonymous ads against it. We need to end political gerrymandering with new voter rights laws through Congress that increase registration rates and lower the barriers to legal voting so that election results are a better reflection of what people actually want. You mandate paper ballots, no-excuse mail ballots for those who want them, and ranked choice for all federal elections. We need to add DC and PR as states to correct the injustice of those Americans being disenfranchised and give Dems a fairer Senate map. We need stronger laws to punish people who accept foreign election interference and to secure voting and voter registration systems from hacking. And you maybe open up Medicare for anyone who wants to join and let the public see that it provides great service and you kill the republican fear mongering.  You do all these things and more and we end up with a Congress that actually is accountable to the people, and not wealthy donors. And then you run with a detailed plan like M4A and make the case to the public and win and get an Congress that has a mandate to implement it.
I find it inconceivable that Warren won't have her personal plan for healthcare, even if it's largely cribbed from Sanders.  The idea that she's radically progressive on everything but healthcare, especially when she does plug M4A and says the market isn't right for healthcare is the silliest wedge attempt by the trolls.  Like they seriously think her platform would be: "I'm going to tax the wealthy, give everyone free childcare and free college... and only make minor tweaks to healthcare".
i love single payer (if I had a magic wand, it'd be my first choice), but there are several other equally effective models of universal coverage!
Isn‚Äôt M4A conspicuously absent from her website?
Busted?
It's a throwback to patriarchal sexist mores.  Women aren't the property or responsibility of the men in their lives.  If she wants to talk to boys, let her.  If she wants someone to keep the boys away, she'll ask for it.
Maybe...it's gross when parents and grandparents do it, too?
Abrams would be amazing
>That is a racist joke.  Maybe I'm dumb and I don't get the context.  How is this racist?
He conceded to Hillary I feel like he'd do the same thing here
Or she concedes. It goes both ways. I'm not sure that it helps for her to stay far into the race if she's ends up being clearly behind.
Now we're talking dream scenario! My true dream is to see Sanders and Warren on the general election ticket together (in whatever order).
It's a not a horse race, but it is a first past the post election. It's not quite as easy as choosing your favorite unfortunately.
It's pretty close for me. Mostly her campaign seems more focused on getting money out of politics, which I think is the biggest issue we have right now. She also seems a little less angry. I'm pretty sick of angry after the last 3 years.
Warren is the better coalition-builder of the two. I think it's not likely Sanders can beat Biden. Whoever needs Biden has to rally voters of all kinds of stripes to his or her cause, from the far left, to the moderates, to the people who are non ideological, to committed Bernie stans, to committed Hillary stans, to people who support fringe candidates, to people who just want electability. I think Bernie is just too factional, he worked as the anti-Hillary candidate but now that there are other options a lot of people left him.  Second, Warren understands policy at a deeper level and if you hear her talk to me it's very clear. I trust her a lot more to solve unforeseen problems.  Third, she has led on key issues where Bernie hasn't. Namely, impeachment. She was way ahead of him on that one.
Bernie was a stump speech. Again.   No one disagreees with him. But we need specifics. I'm good on being  sold dreams, because if you're not calling for guns and pitchforks, then what are you really advocating for? Reformed capitalism?   If thats the case, smarten up and sell it smarter like Warren.
His speech kinda showed more of the same imo, that he‚Äôs an ideas guy more than anything (and not really a social democrat)
I believe Warren can work with others and run the country much better than Bernie. That is why I lean much more to her than Bernie. Bernie has great ideas but is too anti-establishment to find ways to get support for his policies. Warren has similar but slightly less radical policies and knows how to get others behind her.
Biden could very easily fall in the polls, especially when we get to the debates.
Important to note that Biden poached some Bernie supporters when he entered the race. I'm sure a lot of his support is based on the fact he's the frontrunner and not really solid support.
In CA (the poll in question) Biden is at 22%.  CA is a Super Tuesday state now. I really don't see Biden staying strong though the remainder of the race if he can't carry CA.  Both Bernie and Warren are excellent candidates, and it's great news they are both polling so strong. Biden will slip more and more as he doubles down on his "I'm a candidate for rich Dems and non-Trump rich Republicans".  Debates are going to favor both Sanders and Warren strongly, as their views are aligned with the majority of the country across most topics that will come up.
There is no way Biden stays at 32%
RCP is a good aggregator but they are slow to change. They're starting to adjust to Biden's fade though.
They made the same argument in 2016 that Bernie was unelectable and Hillary was electable. When I point that out they say ‚Äúwell she did win the popular vote‚Äù.  Maybe they‚Äôre not that smart, on second thought.
I agree with all of this. I just think it doesn't hurt to call for systemic reforms AND support M4A, so I'm not sure why the reluctance. If anything, it makes the goals of rewriting our laws across the board even more popular.
[STV](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI) can help greatly lessen gerrymandering and eliminates ‚Äúthrowing away your vote‚Äù. We should be fighting for that at the city/county/state level.
What I think she ought to do in framing her stance is, like progressive commentator David Pakman, embrace single payer as a significantly better way to cut costs and expand health care provisions to people than the for-profit system we have now, but at the same time acknowledge that there are multiple ways to achieve the gold standard that is universal coverage and lower costs. It would definitely fit in better with her broader thesis that there needs to be stronger government involvement in such businesses to avoid putting profit motives ahead of the needs of the people. Unfortunately, she's kind of wavering too much, and that isn't doing her much favors.  I love Warren; she's my political hero, and I started off supporting her the moment she announced her run (currently I'm torn between her and Bernie). I'm just trying to be as objective as possible in assessing the candidates' messages, especially from those whom I support.
I have to wonder if she's going to advocate universal healthcare that isn't single payer and thus doesn't *sound* as cool as M4A so she isn't talking about it.
She has signed on as a co sponsor of Bernie‚Äôs bill. But I suspect we will see more from her about healthcare in the coming week, leading up to the first debate. I anticipate the release of a fleshed out healthcare policy before the first debate happens.
in what way shape or form please do explain
They're trying to reference lyrics from *Colors of the Wind* (from Pocahontas).  They've also got a comment in their history of "Nigs gonna nig".  They're a racist.

Not before a few  months of "here's 8 ways Bernie can still win!" Articles
He conceded to Hillary basically at the last possible second. He was done after Super Tuesday, mega done after New York, extra mega done after California, extra crispy after DC, and only after all that he decided to concede when his chances went from 0.01% to 0%. Now some people are all for this and think it was the right thing to do but let's not re-write history. The dude stayed on way, way after most would have conceded.
She would have to be far enough ahead for him to do this.  I could see him hold on until the primary if he can
Oh, I agree.  I‚Äôm just feeling like her stock is rising, and Bernie‚Äôs has plateaued or even starting to shift to Warren.  Either way, I want one of these two and not Biden.  But, I WILL vote Biden in General and hate every moment of it.
The primary actually isn't FPTP.  You need a true majority of delegates to win, which (after the initial vote) may include superdelegates and delegates from other candidates.    Coalition building and maintaining positive favorability among other candidate's supporter is important.  It's almost like a single-transferable vote situation.
I don‚Äôt personally see Bernie as angry.  More frustrated.  And Warren isn‚Äôt necessarily trying to get more money out of politics, but, from what I understand, every citizen getting unfair tax breaks after being worth $50 million.  I like them both and would love to see them team up.
anyone not angry after the past 3 years should be treated as suspect imo
Left-wing politicians have valid reasons to be angry. Anger is worthwhile if it helps people instead of hurting them.
>Warren is the better coalition-builder of the two.  This one is complicated. I think Warren is the better coalition-builder *within* the Democratic Party. But I think Sanders' brand of left-wing populism is more effective at pulling in non-traditional voters, independents, and even some Republicans (I know a few pro-Sanders Republicans that disagree with him on most things, but admire his consistency, his willingness to call out bad behavior by his own party members, and his stances on policies like NAFTA).  I definitely agree that Warren is more diplomatic.  >she has led on key issues where Bernie hasn't. Namely, impeachment.  Agreed. Bernie's responses when he got asked about impeachment after Warren came out for it was the first time I ever felt like Bernie was being dishonest with me. Warren absolutely led the presidential candidates on impeachment. It was the right thing to do.
I see your point.  Well, I do like Warren a lot too.  Can‚Äôt wait to see the debates!
I see your point.  Can‚Äôt wait to hear more from them in the debates!
If his sexist remarks toward Warren in the last debate did nothing, then the debates won't have any affect. His support in the media is what helps him.  National News has been framing Warren's new plan basically paraphrased as 'Warren's plan will cost $52T and take money out of the defense budget while Biden says it is unrealistic and stupid. Now we cut to a commercial from Aetna insurance.'
That just makes me think it‚Äôs a name recognition thing since Bernie and Biden are so different but also more known than the others
I wish it was a Sanders/Warren or Warren/Sanders ticket. Together it would be a LANDSLIDE to defeat Trump.
It can easily happen. Right now he's coming off his initial campaign entry bump and trying to ride his way into the debates on general media mentions. He doesn't need to spend his (abundant) cash reserves the way others do. If it looks like Warren is going to overtake Sanders fully, he's going to go on a blitz trying to push his Obama-era credit and break-up Progressive voters. Biden knows that he's got an inherent advantage against Sanders (he knows how to scare up anti-Socialist votes), where-as his old scraps with Warren are clearly wounds she can knock him down on.   &#x200B;  The important thing for pro-Warren and pro-Sanders folks to do is 1) don't fall for anti-Progressive rhetoric (e.g. see the "Green Imperialism" and "communism" propaganda trolls are throwing into the mix) and 2) whittle away at Biden via his incredible number of gaffes during his time in politics. So long as Biden is forced to give press to Warren/Sanders while defending himself (e.g. see the Hyde Amendment backlash, as well as his failures on economic prescience), he has to spend cash shoring himself up instead of attacking.   &#x200B;  Most importantly, we must be courteous, open, honest, and mindful of reality. If numbers don't look good, flailing for reasons the world is against us (instead of finding ways for it to be for us) will only accelerate problems. This race isn't just about putting the best candidate forward, but also making sure that we stay together (progressives, moderates, 3rd way, etc) and make sure Trump and Co. can't pull off a second upset because our egos are chaffed.
Pointing out things that are true makes people dumb now?
I'm not saying Warren or others shouldn't support M4A. Dems need to keep talking about it to win the public over. Overton window and all that.  I'm saying I don't think you've going to find the votes in the Senate and in the House for major systematic changes like M4A or the Green New Deal without first fixing the systems that determines who goes to Congress.   1. Fix elections to Congress 2. Elect a better Congress 3. A Better Congress can now take bold action to address the issues
I dunno, she's explicitly said she doesn't think markets work for healthcare.  I really think she's focusing on how the transition happens and how exactly you pay for it.  > **Warren:** I think that markets mostly don‚Äôt work in [healthcare and education]. It‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt pieces that you could make work, but no. Health care is something that is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. Public education is public education because it‚Äôs not market-driven. Markets don‚Äôt work well here.  https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18652215/elizabeth-warren-interview-2020-democratic-primary-policies
maybe this will clear it up: [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/joe-biden-iowa-2020-campaign-teenage-girl-fence-warning.html](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/joe-biden-iowa-2020-campaign-teenage-girl-fence-warning.html)  >The subtext of these jokes is threefold. First, Biden wants to alert these girls and young women‚Äîand their families‚Äîto the fact that he finds them very attractive, and therefore they are in danger. Second, the only people who can protect them from the implicit threat other men might pose who are like Biden‚Äîbut *certainly* not Biden himself‚Äîare the men in their own lives, or a ‚Äúbig fence,‚Äù presumably built by a man. Third, these girls don‚Äôt have a say in when and how their sexual lives begin‚Äîthat‚Äôs up to Biden and the designated guardians.    >   >Biden has been able to use this line because some part of him recognizes that the people he‚Äôs addressing are largely powerless to respond. They are young girls and women who have already been taught to be embarrassed by their bodies and their appearance, who are now forced to listen and laugh nervously as a very powerful man uses their budding sexuality as the butt of his joke.
......oh  Woosh.
Ah thanks for the clarification
Same goes with her, but I have a feeling neither will. Very worried the progressive vote will get split. So far Biden's numbers aren't moving much. It seems Warren is mostly getting her new votes from Bernie voters. Hopefully something changes....

Elizabeth Warren on Twitter: "Today, I‚Äôm releasing my plan to pay for Medicare For All"
"#MedicareForAll finally brings true choice to the health care system. The choice to see the doctor you want, to get the prescriptions you need, pick the job or start that small business you want without worrying about where your health insurance will come from."   This alone in my opinion is all the argument you need for why this is good. It helps level the playing field, I don't have to find a new doctor every year my employer gets new health insurance.  This creates more freedom of choice than ever before.
This plan is REALLY well done.  Yes, there will be political battles to fight over it, but not conceding to a middle class tax increase is huge, and really, the political battles contained are ones she's already waging against large corporations and the uber-wealthy.  Total Liz Warren power move.
We live in a political climate where taking a position is considered bad politics.  Republicans literally won on not having a healthcare plan and just trashing Obamacare. That was their strategy - Literally to not give democrats any piece of legislation to critique, so all of the critique was on the other side.  Look for people to do this - To try to tear this apart while offering no specifics of their vision themselves.  Call people out when you see this. We should be applauding candidates that are willing to put themselves out there, not decrying them.
Elizabeth Warren's Medicare plan is really good. And the most important thing is that she did not back down from the central pledge, which is single payer.  Under her plan:  No middle class tax  Everyone will be covered  Covers everything.  This is a WIN for Ms Warren, this is what has been the elephant in the room. I am happy for her.
Oh boy. This is going to be a long weekend.  Get ready folks, this one is going to be a big one. There are going to be a lot of people with questions, comments, praise, and criticism. Expect a lot of people from other Dem candidates to have very strong opinions on this plan.  I strongly recommend that every Warren supporter become familiar with this particular plan.
One thing I like is how one of the pay-fors is cutting the defense budget, which can arguably be seen as a form of deficit laundering- there's a historic bipartisan lack of fucks-given for driving up deficits with defense spending, so it's entirely possible that whatever cuts the M4A bill entails will eventually be given back, but in that case it becomes the defense spending that's upping the deficit, not M4A.  Obviously it's probably ideal if those cuts actually stick for a number of reasons, but it's a clever way of exploiting the blatant double standard where "how are you gonna pay for it?" applies when the left wants to expand the welfare state but not when the blob wants to drop bombs on brown people half a world away.
I'm a Pete supporter but just commenting here that I think Warren's plan was a great political move. I'm sure budget nerds will be able to poke holes in it, but the large headlines of keeping M4A and not raising taxes for middle class will be what the voters hear. Def countered Pete's recent attacks and basically made it moot. Look forward to more debate on this and other issues though. good luck!
I read the plan, and signed up to donate.  However at the end of donating there is a link to a thank you survey. The survey is a dead link, which isn't a huge deal but they should try to get that fixed ASAP.   Edit: Seems to be an issue with the link on the ActBlue website, as entering the URL to my browser brought up the right page.
This is a political winner in the primary and the general election. There are going to be some people that are against single payer, but they will be heavily outnumbered by those that look at this for what it is: a structural re-imagining of the U.S. healthcare system that would save countless lives and give the middle class a historic tax break. This is how a grassroots movement is made and how we win elections.
She is my hero.
Wow. Coming from a different candidates campaign, but I have to say, the work put in on this plan blew me away.   There were a few spots I thought sounded wonky or worrying on the funding and would be better to just bite the bullet and raise taxes on middle class a small amount. I suppose that comes after the election though.   Even so the work her campaign has done on fleshing out the expenditures for her plan is really a huge achievement. Don't really have any questions, I just wanted to offer my genuine congratulations to Warren and her supporters for this amazing proposal.
primary season makes the strong candidates stronger, this being prime example. I have some nitpicks but overall this will cover over the few weaknesses she has
She also says she'll be releasing a transition plan that she'll implement as soon as she's sworn in. Might be a voluntary Medicare buy-in, maybe for 55+.
Better than I thought it would be, I assumed out of pocket for higher income households would get roped into a higher M4A payment (and I was happy for that). This is even better!  Everyone who freaks out about "but if I make more you take more????"  > The tax burden on ultra-millionaires and billionaires is less than half that of working families in the United States. In 2019, the bottom 99% of families will pay 7.2% of their wealth in taxes, while the top 0.1% of households will pay just 3.2%. My Ultra-Millionaire Tax, a 2-cent tax on the wealth of fortunes above $50 million, tackles this head on. Under this tax, the top 0.1% ‚Äì the wealthiest 75,000 Americans  Only 75,000 americans are going to get hit with "extra taxes" these are not people doing moderately well, this is not even most lottery winners. These are families doing extremely well far beyond most people are even capable of imagining. The percentage Warren is talking about coupled with the wealth tax would bring their percentage contribution up to the same as the rest of the country. With the massive wealth these families have it would amount to just some portfolio adjustments. Anyone selling their gulfstream 5 for a gulfstream 4 will just be making a show of it. It wont really hurt these people, don't let them tell you it will.
Can we get an apology from all the twitter asshats who pushed that Liz didn't REALLY support M4A? Cause right now she's the only candidate with a detailed platform on paying for it all.
Wow, that is comprehensive. And almost all of it sounds fantastic. She has a hell of a writing/editing team. (I'm pretty nitpicky and only found one typo.)  After review, I have two concerns:  1. The health insurance industry employs up to 2.6 million people. Only a select few executives at the top are raking in the big bucks - the rest are making normal middle class incomes. Eliminating private insurance would create a monumental upheaval in job security for most of that 2.6 million. I believe in M4A, but there is still a question of how to assist these individuals, many of whom are middle class, with their inevitable job transitions. Not to mention that there are also the many administrators at hospitals, doctors offices, etc., who only have jobs because billing and working with insurance is so complicated. Many of their jobs are at risk too, because M4A would be more efficient. If something once took 50 people, and can now be managed by 5, what happens to the other 45 jobs?   2. This is nitpicky, but it's not completely true that taxes on middle class Americans won't go up. There's a section partway through, where she congratulates us on the raise we all get by eliminating premiums from our paychecks. But then she also says that some of the revenues to pay for M4A are raised by taxing that income at normal tax rates. Sure, it's still cheaper than the premium was, but that's still technically a higher tax contribution.
LOOK AT MY POST HISTORY everyone owes me an apology for telling me I was wrong when I called this right after the last debates as the reason she was refusing to get specific on taxes. WIG FLEW
Guys, this is good. I like this.   And I love the shade thrown at Mayor Pete and friends for their half-assedness.
I was waiting for her to finally drop it!
But I was told that she doesn‚Äôt actually support M4A by some Bernie bro‚Äôs on Twitter?
$11 Trillion is a massive (and much needed) redistribution of wealth.
Holy shit, M4A *and* no raised taxes on the middle class? That's ridiculous.
My family pays about 5k/year just in premiums. Both our childrens births hit our deductible of 4500. We've had one ER visit, some urgent care visits and a few scrips. Roughly 35k, or about 10% of our household income, since 2016, in medical expenses.  And I consider us lucky.  We're all one major illness from disaster and I'm so tired of seeing Go Fund Me campaigns for sick kids because the treatment is 'unaffordable'.   This changes everything.
Oh shit, here we go. Diving in
"bUt sHe dOeSn'T sUpPoRt m4A" -astroturfers
Queen.
Where is Trump‚Äôs plan for better, cheaper healthcare for everyone that he promised 4 years ago?
Granted I haven't read as much into this as I should, so if its been covered let me know, but how does this plan deal with physician reimbursements?  Reimbursements have been declining or stagnant and not keeping pace with inflation, so how does this tackle it? Will the savings in administrative waste etc also be passed into better physician reimbursements which will translate into better quality care? Because from the viewpoint of a medical student, I am effectively taking out a mortgage to finance my training,  I'm all for MedicareForAll but I've yet to read anything that talks about how physicians will be compensated. Most of us wouldn't mind a paycut, we aren't expecting to be rich, but we also cant have tuition & cost of attendance per year be 75k at a public med school, 100k at private and rising and see future reimbursements slashed.
A wealth tax is a corrective tax . If it works , it‚Äôs supposed to generate less revenue because it would make ultra rich people just a little poorer . Also, they will look to ways to evade it , lie about their income , or just redirect the money to other channels . There‚Äôs a reason why many countries have abandoned it . I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter , but I really like Liz too. However , using it to partly fund M4A is a mistake . The wealth tax isn‚Äôt a deal breaker for me if it‚Äôs not counted on to fund a huge priority.   As for the plan , it‚Äôs more politically realistic , but it‚Äôs hard to implement . Bernie‚Äôs is the opposite . It‚Äôs a tougher sell with a more straightforward funding approach. My question is : what if the wealth tax doesn‚Äôt return the revenue that‚Äôs expected ? What if cracking down on tax cheats doesn‚Äôt return what you expect ? Would she blow a hole in the deficit to fund M4A? Would she then raise taxes on the middle class and go back on her promise ? It‚Äôs much easier to be honest and say that you will raise taxes on everyone , but most people will net save money because they‚Äôre not paying a mafia -like insurance company . Dancing around the idea is already giving into Republican/Corporate Democrat framing and brings huge risks if she were actually to become President .
Someone on her Twitter (a Bernie bot) claimed that Bernie still had a one-up on Warren because he had his plan first.  I pointed out that Sanders is dodging the question of payment, hopefully just saving his answer for a later date. As backup, I link an [NPR story](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/29/774397574/bernie-sanders-wont-yet-explain-how-he-would-pay-for-medicare-for-all) about how Bernie refuses to admit how he'd pay.  I then get told to ignore the MSM narrative.
Reading more  > Over time, an employer‚Äôs health care cost-per-employee would be gradually shifted to converge at the average health care cost-per-employee nationally. **That helps make sure the system is fair but also gives employers and employees time to adapt to the new system.**¬†¬†   So long term it is a per employee tax?  Doesn't that disproportionately impact employers in lower wage industries while favoring high wage earners?
I cannot wait to read this omggg
Only $52 trillion?
Job losses from this might be a problem. We have half a million insurance salesmen plus all the IT, accounting, call centers, etc. that support that industry.
&#x200B;  > To calculate their new Employer Medicare Contribution, employers would determine what they spent on health care over the last few years and divide that by the number of employees of the company in those years to arrive at an average health care cost per employee at the company. (Companies would count part-time employees towards the total based on the number of hours they worked during a year.) Under the first year of Medicare for All, employers would then take that average cost, adjust it upwards to account for the overall increase in national health care spending, and multiply it by their total number of employees that year. Their Employer Medicare Contribution would be 98% of that amount ‚Äì **ensuring that every company paying for health care today will pay less than they would have if they were still offering their employees comparable private insurance.**¬†   Doesn't this punish employers who have actually been contributing to employee health care and allow those who do not provide benefits or who pushed cost increases on to their employees to skate on contributing? Or am I reading this incorrectly?
This is great. Let's see those idiots try to ask her if she'll raise taxes.
[deleted]
Let me guess, a carbon copy of bernies
Warren backed herself in a corner by refusing to say middle class taxes would not rise. I feel that she felt it necessary to be able to say that was true, so she had to use suboptimal changes to tax policy to make it happen. With a broader base (including middle but not lower class), would make this policy more robust and able to withstand economic pressures. It would also be more palatable overall. Warren is still far and away my top choice, but I'm afraid she caved to populist sentiment over the optimal policy and it definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
I fully believe Warren will win the primary, but currently support Biden or Mayor Pete, really any moderate candidate with a pulse. Her best plans are the climate plans. They are really sound, and would help kickstart the ‚Äúnew economy ‚Äú, and we could once again lead in something. Yet, I just can‚Äôt see why m4a is the priority, and think it could be a huge waste of money in the short term. This is because, I think in the coming years our national security and economy are going to be most threatened as climate change manifests itself. I feel like m4a should be a phase 2, and climate action should be phase 1.   So weirdly enough, we should probably be increasing defense spending in the form of things like electric grid and energy source upgrades coupled with clean transportation and technological research initiatives. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is, the money that would be used for m4a could go to things like this in the shorter term that could secure a better future.

Just seems too good to be true. Increased coverage at lower total costs while not raising taxes? In fact increasing take home pay. No deductibles, co-pays, full dental, vision, audio too.  Sounds like a nice idea but just seems a little too far fetched for me.
[deleted]
There‚Äôs zero chance this even passes for one, but even more so it‚Äôs a lie that middle class taxes would not have to go up. Does that mean they‚Äôd pay more in taxes than they do in premiums or cost-sharing now? No. But middle class taxes will have to increase to be able to have a sustainable long-term funding of a single-payer system as vast and generous as the one Warren is offering. On top of that, her version of Medicare appears to still be fee-for-service which is one of the worst things about Medicare. If they moved towards capitated payments with more Accountable Care Organizations that would be more enticing.   Even in nations with single-payer they have to either have value added taxes or more payroll taxes to maintain stable funding of less generous single-payer plans than the one Warren is offering. On top of that, most single-payer plans are often administered at either the state, provincial or municipal level. This plan is not which can complicate matters.  What this does accomplish is allowing her to have an answer for how it‚Äôs financed although it really isn‚Äôt that different from what she‚Äôs said.
This plan is disingenuous.
A plan that would immediately put us into a depression, nice.
Lmao if she's not going to raise middle class taxs then the m4a is dead in the water. This pretty much signals that if she does become president she's going to probably settle for a public option. Which isn't a bad thing really. It's what most of the western world has.
Increase payroll tax is a tax on the middle class, people are so dumb to think billionaires will even pay the 6 percent asset tax. How dumb are people to think thr gov can actually create anything functional. DMV has always been great
[removed]
Yep! Not only does it seem like a pretty good plan, it also has great messaging. The messaging around healthcare and the opposition to something like Medicare for all has always tried to focus on choice and taxes. Pretending that something like M4A takes away choice. Glad to see her turning that on its head and telling the truth. We don‚Äôt really have choice right now. Our employers pick our insurance, and our insuranceÔøºÔøº pick which doctors we‚Äôre allowed to see. With this, we would actually have choice. Medical care would be covered, and we could go to whichever doctor we actually want to. Not which one the insurance company says were allowed to.Ôøº   Then, on top of that, she found a way to pay for it without raising taxes on the working class. So she doesn‚Äôt even have to do what Bernie is doing, and saying that yeah taxes will go up, but you‚Äôll save more in healthcare. She can just flat out say no, your taxes won‚Äôt go up, you‚Äôll just save money on healthcare, *and* get better healthcare, *and* have actual choice.Ôøº
So happy to see that she has not, in fact, been dodging the middle class tax hike- she's been planning around it, withholding her answer until she found a way to do it.  Go Liz.
Super thorough.  She provides so many options to close the last bit of the gap too.  I also appreciate that she takes the time to say (paraphrase) 'This is Possible, and there is no legitimate reason I know of that says it isn't.'  Then she goes on to provide an essay on costs and many different ways of funding.
Its no increase in payments + elimination of all out-of-pocket expenses. That cuts my yearly costs for healthcare in 1/2. That is bigger than the cut trump gave the middle by quite a bit.
Businesses defer cost to consumers. Whatever taxes she imposes on businesses and corporations, while promising to not increase taxes on the middle class, will absolutely end up being paid by the buying middle class.
Total Bernie Sanders power move.
The plan unfortunately is not well done in all aspects. A 6% wealth tax on billionaires is a complete nonstarter. She should have stuck with her 3% and found something else. She is going to get wrecked for it and opened up a weak point in her plan.  Having employers contribute is a great idea, and her implementation their looks solid.  I'm not convinced on the financial transactions tax but I could be. I am curious how the tax would affect the volume of trade and how that would impact the macroeconomy. Dropping accelerated expensing is a no brainier. Her foreign minimum tax rate at 35% needs to be accompanied by raising the domestic Corp rate to the same, but I'm not sure if it does that yet.
She needed to get it out now because she was being grilled there and that was exposing a hole in her resume even if she has the most comprehensive set of plans.
This is bullshit. There absolutely would have to be a middle class tax hike. The rich are not just going to go aw shucks and fork it over. In a perfect world yeah but its just not realistic. I wish it was.
Right on! Then Mayor Pete , Biden , and Kamala will act like their plans don‚Äôt cost a lot and STILL require people to pay premiums to Mafia-like insurance companies . The onus is always on Warren and Bernie to answer : ‚Äú HoW aRe YOu goINg to PaY foR iT?‚Äù But no one asks the ‚Äú moderates ‚Äú how they‚Äôre going to pay for their still expensive plans.   Trump , on the other hand , has no plan except destroy the AC√Å and hope the ‚Äú free market ‚Äú ( a complete misnomer of a term ) magically fixes everything. So he will call the nominee a socialist and then say that everyone will have healthcare if he‚Äôs re-elected ( and offering no substance ) . That will satisfy his cult members and all he has to do is demonize the Dem candidate to get the slice of Independent voters to win the Electoral College.
yes, a lot of it is speculation on cost decreases and raised incomes, I'm sure the headlining attack will be the multi-trillion-dollar gap between her expert's estimation of the cost and the cost estimate when you don't factor in cost & income changes.
The biggest challenge I've seen from Bernie supporters is the potential for employers to reclassify all their employees as independent contractors to avoid paying into the fund.  I think the fear of that is a little overblown, 1099s are already abused and hopefully the extra funding for the IRS would help with enforcing our already existing laws around employees vs contractors.  Another is the fact that payments are based on head count rather than salaries.
My biggest question, which I haven't see addresses (may have missed it).  Will doctors be required to accept Medicare?  Currently they do not and hospitals have expressed concern on being able to function with the lower reimbursement rate
I work in DoD Finance. I approve this message.
But how sustainable is that going to be as a financing plan long-term? Especially when another president of a different party takes over?
I'm not a budget nerd, but I'm a healthcare nerd and this plan addresses all the things we've been saying for 10+ years about how to implement Universal healthcare.  Mainly, it addresses cost cutting and combats price gouging by big hospitals and pharma by strong arming them into stopping their greedy practices and charging more fairly.  There is zero reason **non-profit** hospital executives and CEOs are making tens of millions of dollars a year.  I don't like criticizing the other candidates, but the problem with allowing the private insurance industry to continue existing is that it creates two healthcare markets, and providers can just refuse to work with medicare altogether and only choose to work with the private system, and a lot of people will go along with it even if it costs them more money because they love their doctors.  We simply cannot cut costs to be on par with what other developed countries pay while there is a private sector manipulating the system.
I'm not sure about *moot* but it definitely addresses the middle class tax question from the debate. The question about the multi-trillion dollar hole on the deficit that is unaccounted for, and the practical implementation methodology on such a tight timeline are still worth asking questions about.    I'm just glad we have candidates who put out such thorough and thoughtful plans like this so that the debate is substantive not just personal or stylistic.
üéµ *Watch her as she goes* üéµ
>There were a few spots I thought sounded wonky or worrying on the funding and would be better to just bite the bullet and raise taxes on middle class a small amount. I suppose that comes after the election though.  This is something a lot of people will need to get comfortable with. For better or worse, none of the candidates running will pass their plans as written.
I think just arbitrarily increasing the WT to 6% for billionaires sort of buys into an argument that liberals want to use the rich as a slush fund for their projects. I would prefer a more modest increase in the WT, and a premium pegged to income (and a progressive/marginal percentage of income that starts at 0 for up to 300% of the poverty rate).  I also think the head tax can punish businesses that make the right move and give better healthcare in the current environment, which isn't great, but i don't really know what the alternative is.
Some of them are *still* saying that.
>The health insurance industry employs up to 2.6 million people  No, it doesn't. [Roughly 500,000 people worked in the health insurance industry in 2017.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194229/number-of-health-insurance-employees-in-the-us-since-1960/) That 2.6 mil number involves other areas of insurance (and there are lots of other areas of insurance). Some of those will be absorbed into the government jobs that will arise because of the switch, some of the health insurance providers may pivot to other forms of insurance (like life insurance), and everyone else will likely be able to find jobs in another sector as their skills are highly transferable. Warren is also going to be releasing a transition plan that accounts for health insurance workers losing their jobs as well.
I'll tackle your nitpicky one.  She is carful to say "No New Taxes" on the middle class. You will just get taxed the same tax rate as normal. But since your income just went up, you also get taxed for having a higher income.  The key is the "no new taxes" line as it is true without stating that individuals bottom line taxes will not change.   But really, it is just like the people saying "I don't work overtime because it just raises my taxes!" It is a misunderstanding of taxes that causes then to make that mistake.
Her plans take a long time to write and she's not pulling them out of thin air. This goes over every economist and organization she's worked with to come up with it. This is why I trust in her professor background. She knows how to do it and get it done.
I'm sorry?
Being moderate or incremental isn‚Äôt half-assedness. You realize it is rare that we ever pass huge pieces of legislation in this country? Medicare only passed in part because Kennedy was assassinated and Johnson had a hell of a lot of political capital to spend on passing that and Medicaid. Aside from that it‚Äôs taken a Great Depression and Great Recession for us to pass any kind of sweeping legislation. If Warren is elected she‚Äôs not going to have long to try and pass her health plan and the chances are slim to none even with a majority of Democrats.
The new complaint is that Bernie did it first while they completely ignore the fact that a recent quote from Bernie says he won't answer the question. haha  https://www.npr.org/2019/10/29/774397574/bernie-sanders-wont-yet-explain-how-he-would-pay-for-medicare-for-all
Obviously, that doesn't make it true.
I found that particular talking point annoying myself but  > Bernie bro's  I would respectfully ask that you not use divisive language like this. It's sexist to both his male and female supporters. We can do better.
Screw those people.  Warren is the real deal and she's standing by what she believes.
Axe Obamacare, defund Medicare, tons of savings and Americans get access to so many beautiful private insurance plans.
Bernie doesn't have a defined funding plan, so there's not really anything to compare.  And his most defined plan includes a wealth tax as one of the funding options.  Her numbers have been checked by economists, but everything is necessarily an estimate.  That's the best you can get at this point.  If it falls short, so what?  We've added to the deficit for much less beneficial programs and the vast majority of the funding comes from exactly the places that are funding healthcare today, not wealth taxes.    It's very weird for Bernie supporters to now be extremely fiscally conscious when up until now M4A hasn't had an actual funding plan.
Why are we suddenly worried about people who exploit labor in low-wage industries?   And for what it's worth cities like PDX and SF already charge employers a head tax to cover health care. AFAIK it hasn't affected those industries.
This is no different from current wage structures. So it won't actually change anything, now or in the future.  Right now, employers pay a a ton of money as the "employer portion" of health care (for me, I pay $126 a paycheck and they pay something around $375). Turning that into a tax means that nothing actually changes.
Yeah, poor Walmart.  It's not like wealthy people costed more to insure than poor people (probably less), so for businesses that actually insured their employees there's no real difference.  For those that *don't* however, this will make them pick up the benefit they should have been providing this whole time.    Interesting to see Bernie people now concerned with the bottom line of shitty employers.  They should be forced to support their employees regardless, and the only way they were avoiding it thus far was with unethical practices.  I'm happy to give Costco a competitive advantage over Walmart for actually supporting their employees.
And, yet, at the same time those jobs will need to be performed by the federal government, more likely by contractors. Ten bucks says most of the companies affected by this will wind up being contracted by the government to pretty much do what they're doing now.
I think people overestimate this.  First, most of these roles are translatable.  There are jobs out there for each role that will be allegedly downsized.  But there's a big part 2 to this everyone forgets.  Do you think behemoths like BCBS are going to just up and die?  Just liquidate and everyone goes home?  Doubt it.    I know people at dental insurance companies in divisions that DON'T provide insurance, that are faster growing and making more margins than the insurance division.  I can see medical insurance going the same way.  Marketing-focused plans that guarantee some level of service, or extra-subsidization... even a kickback to the patient for picking a specific doctor for otherwise 100% covered care.  Hell, in some cases, these companies might get government contracts to stay involved in the direct insurance process as well.  They just won't be in the same dynamic that frees drug companies to play them against each other for everyone's (except the patient's) profit.
Thankfully all of those jobs are easily transferable to other industries
The need for manpower won‚Äôt evaporate.  It will transition to government employees.
Medicare reimbursement is also very low compared to private insurance.  Right now doctors aren't required to accept medicare, I dont see that aspect addressed.  Some hospital administrators have expressed concern on being able to exist at that rate of reimbusement.
I don't really see it as a punishment -- it's similar to college debt forgiveness, just because you are being more lenient to those who have paid less in the past doesn't mean it's a punishment those that are more "responsible".  It is also just to make the transition much less burdensome. It is just for the first year, and it gradually shifts to converge at the average cost-per-employee -- so over time, the employers who historically treated their customers well would see a significant decline in their health care spending, whereas employers who skated on contributing will see less of a decline (and probably even see an increase).
I can't believe you're seriously making an argument both against maintaining current funding to reduce disruption AND [against moving to an average](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/dq3qk4/elizabeth_warren_on_twitter_today_im_releasing_my/f60nezn/).  You're talking out of both sides of your mouth.  Is it a punishment for those that provide insurance for their employees or those that don't?    We know now neither argument is in good faith now.
Looks like anyone under $1m of assets.
I don't think she backed herself into a corner, I think this was her basic plan all along and she needed the time to run it past economists and other experts to make sure it held up.
>Yet, I just can‚Äôt see why m4a is the priority  That's because you aren't going bankrupt trying to pay for your medical bills, or it would be your #1 priority too. It's hard for the average person to care about climate change when they can't even pay to go to the doctor.
Her number one priority is anti-corruption.  While healthcare is very high on her list, it is not the top of the list. But every debate has spent 30+ minutes talking about it, so she is getting a better answer ready for the next one.  If healthcare is not top priority, the debate (and Pete) should not have spent so much time on it.
False scarcity. There‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt do it all- we bailed out the banks, and reduced student debt, and passed the ACA in two years of Democratic control.
Assuming Hillary doesn‚Äôt do a late swoop? I keep getting emails asking if I‚Äôd support it. üò§
The plan is challenging to get through, but she covers everything in very decent detail.  Mainly, she is increasing taxes on the rich to pay for it. It is much more complex than that, but that is what it boils down to. Oh, she is also forcing companies to actually pay a tax on their profits instead of shipping profits offshore to tax Haven's.  But it is all possible and doable. If you have a specific questions, I'll try and find specific answers.
VATs are regressive. They are a decent form form of consumption tax, but definitely regressive as all consumption taxes are.
VATs are regressive.  Stop trying to make VATs a thing.
Warren Overtakes Biden as Most Favorable Candidate
Wait till the first few primaries, we'll see support consolidating in a few candidates, and we'll see who's really ahead.
Oh she comin, she comin. She comin for yah voters, she comin for yah policies, she comin for yah Presidency.
The Economist site that this passes through to has a lot of interesting graphics from averaged polls.  It wasn't clear exactly which polls they averaged though.    https://projects.economist.com/democratic-primaries-2020/
so much good news already and it is only september .3.
Being favorable and being electable are two different things. I'm glad to see senator Warren is viewed favorably but I'd like to see her poll numbers come up too. I'm a Bernie bro but Warren is a very close second. I hope one of the two of them end up as our nominee. Let's go progressives!
Ba Bye Biden! #NameRecognitionCanOnlyTakeYouSoFar
Warren / Sanders 2020 plz :3 <3
[removed]
Twelve stories high made of radiation    The present beware    The future beware    She's coming    She's coming    She's coming
Looking at that polling average graph it's very clear to see by the trendline who has the momentum so far.
Wow. Warren is strikingly consistent among all age demographics. That‚Äôs really interesting.
Okay future redditor, got any got ~~being~~ betting tips?
Agreed. I'm a big fan of Sanders but I've recently really come around to Warren being my favorite.  I'd be FUCKING THRILLED with either one of them, however!
She's starting to do **a lot** better in national polls. Better in key states like Arizona and Pennsylvania than everyone except Sanders and Biden.  But to be honest, she's only marginally behind Sanders. It's purely name recognition that those two are ahead.
High favorability is especially important for a female candidate unfortunately so it's a good sign.
What blows me away about the latest polls is the fact they are practically neck and neck. That means that they are gaining support from others, rather than undercutting each other. My big worry was that Biden would coast as the progressive vote would be split between them, but so far that hasn't happened and I feel fairly confident there's a big overlap in support for both, even with these poll numbers. I have no issues supporting either candidate in the general, even if I prefer Warren. I'm willing to bet I'm not the only one.  Imagine if the race was between the two of them. What a fantastic choice to have.
I like Sanders, but id rather keep one of the two in the senate to push progressive legislation. Maybe put Bullock (Gov MT) if he‚Äôs not going to run for senate to pull in Montana to a battle ground, or perhaps Abrams to make GA more winnable. It might be worth it to go with Roy Cooper (Gov NC) to hopefully swing NC blue.
~~If you come to this sub to call her a joke, could you explain why?~~ Actually, you're a T_D troll. Nobody wants your opinion
Also Warren tops every single top tier candidates supporters considering list. That's huge. If Harris and Buttigieg start looking weak and voters are looking to help pick the actual winner, their most likely to pick Warren, that could then tip more Sanders supporters into her column as a "Stop Biden" option, and at that point she's got it wrapped up.
Hm? .3. I don't understand,.
My dream ticket is the two of them together. I don't care who takes on what role, if Warren and Sanders team up there is no better ticket! These two working together could save our nation.
Warren -Abrams would be amazing. Almost too good to be true.
Beto would be the safe bet, I think, especially if you‚Äôre going after the southern states to potentially swing blue.
Has to be someone you can trust to continue to carry out bold progressive legislation. Warren is in this to actually fix America. She isn‚Äôt going to pick someone like Beto or Booker or whoever just to shore up votes. They have to be an actual ally to the cause in case something happens to her. That‚Äôs why I think there‚Äôs a good chance that Sanders would pick Warren if he gets the nomination, and Warren would pick someone like Sanders, Abrams, Inslee, etc.
It's not September
This gets brought up a lot. I think that if one is elected, the other needs to stay in the Senate. They can do much more good there than as VP. Plus, the VP should add something to the ticket and give the candidate a broader appeal. Warren and Sanders don't do that for each other.
I think one of them being in the Senate would work better. Either one as Senate Majority Leader would help get buy-in on the policies the other puts forth.
Personality I‚Äôd like Cory Booker in there. As far as I‚Äôve ever been able to tell he‚Äôs a sincerely good person, an excellent speaker, and has a heartfelt belief in people working together to better their communities.
It's a lovely thought but we need one of them in the Senate! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I think there's a real chance of that. Warren/Castro could also happen.
yeah, with Warren at the top of the ticket I'd bet on someone from the Sun Belt as VP
neither is it September 3rd
oh, yeah.  unfortunately I must return to school soon, so september has been on my mind so much I forget that it isn't actually here yet.
Counterpoint: the VP on this ticket must be as committed a progressive as the P. Otherwise they'll just be another Kennedy- killed for trying to pull back on the MIC and replaced with their more compliant back-up like Johnson. Given both candidates' age, it wouldn't even have to be visibly murder, plenty of health problems could be faked.
I‚Äôm on the Warren/Castro train personally.

‚ÄúI promise no matter who our candidate is, I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a Democratic congress.‚Äù
I do hope Warren is the nominee, but if not I agree with her I wanna vote Donald Trump out
[removed]
We need a nominee who's smart enough to understand the current moment and what needs to happen in response to the Trump era. Warren is that nominee.
For awhile i was torn between warren and Kamala but the more I listen to warren the more I want her to be my president. She seems to have the mettle to get into a mud fight with carrothead, and her policy depth is astoundingly impressive. I think she‚Äôll get into office and push those crooked bureaucrats to actually work for reform.
I have been saying it awhile now to those in my friends and family that are not Trumpsters, the ONLY way that our side will get him out of the White House is to have ALL of the candidates unite to work together to make it happen.  Never before have we needed a team effort on something as important as this, and I love Warren, there are a few candidates up there I like, but the ones we need the most are those willing to unite the leadership.
I absolutely trust Warren in this regard. She is a team player which is one of the reasons I support her!  Sad you can't say that for every candidate.
I noticed that too, and agree it was a quick statement but held a lot of weight. Meaningful and powerful.
Great point and well stated. Her authenticity and focus on bringing democrats together for the good of all rather than on herself definitely distinguishes her from the crowd.
I love this comment I read the other day in the Washington Post:  "She is the best natural candidate in the field. You get the sense that she is up to the job."
Sanders set this precedent last election and continues to act upon it. Glad to see Warren is another person that shares in this mindset.
Corey Booker has actually said it a couple times now as well. Ge said he‚Äôd do everything he can to elect whoever comes out of the democratic primaries. I appreciate any candidate who is making that claim.
Dear DNC,  Please don't get any ideas.   . .  Thanks,  A voter.
If it's Biden though, I cannot vote for him. Just can't. He supported the Iraq war and that's too large a sin for me to get over
What if both Democrats and Republicans are wrong and a 3rd party candidate is the best fit?
Yep every serious candidate and many of the joke candidates would be better choices.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deez_Nuts_(politician)
Does a litmus test tell you how strong your base is?  I'll see myself out now.
I think all of the derisive comments about the democratic candidates, even the ones people don't like, will only lead to trump winning the election.
Yes! Absolutely true. The debate also reminded me of why and how much I grew to respect and admire Sanders last election. The two of them are remarkable collaborators.   Sanders does not ignite my spirit in the same way that Warren does however. When it comes to discussing issues of race I feel like Sanders has too often struggled to really grasp 21st century terms and frames. Warren convinces me that she *gets* it.   Strategically, Warren has been able to learn from and refine Sanders ‚Äò16 by developing more broadly accessible language for their shared policies and vision. I‚Äôm not a capitalist. Like Bernie, I identify as a democratic socialist. However, Warren‚Äôs expressed (‚Äùto her bones‚Äù) commitment to capitalism I think, I hope, allows a wider range of Americans to entertain these ideas and come to see how they will improve their lives and the lives of most Americans.  It was something at the beginning of her campaign that I had to really mull over before committing to Warren, but in the end, I felt that her experience and fierce desire to regulate the hell out of capitalism made her choice of terms acceptable to me.  Edit: correction to ‚Äúdemocratic socialist‚Äù
I hadn‚Äôt realized that and I am so glad to hear it.
Not sure why you were downvoted. They had their thumb on the scale in 2016, and DWS is a scoundrel who should not be in Congress.
We CANT do this. This is what led to Trump. This is the kind of thing that Russia worked to push in 2016. It is unacceptable in 2020. (I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre a troll or just swallowing their spin)  Trump is dangerous.   That‚Äôs not hyperbole, that‚Äôs not fear-mongering, it‚Äôs the truth. In one term he has chipped away at our democracy with a sledgehammer, opened up concentration camps at the border, degraded our relationships with allies, ruined our reputation in the world, increased hate crimes with his vitriol, rallied and been the ally of white supremacists and domestic terrorists who kill in support of him or as a result of the culture he‚Äôs not created but stoked the kindling of and done nothing to stop. He will be able to appoint more far-right judges in the Supreme Court and around the country. Women will lose rights. Minorities will lose rights. LGBTQ+ people will lose rights. The list is never ending and heartbreaking and we can‚Äôt survive four more years under his presidency.   This country will change to be unrecognizable.   People will die.   Whatever your thoughts, not a one of the Democratic candidates will lead to a worse outcome than four more years of a fascist wanna-be dictator who is working with dictators around the world and making this country dangerous for many of our fellow citizens.   You don‚Äôt think Trump will start a fucking war?  Your comments are dangerous. That kind of thinking is dangerous. I don‚Äôt know if you are sincere or a troll, but we need to call out the unacceptably of this rhetoric.   I‚Äôm all in for Warren. I don‚Äôt like Biden. I don‚Äôt like Delaney. I don‚Äôt think someone like Williamson should be on stage. If ANY ONE of them gets the nomination I will still crawl on goddamn broken glass to vote for them. To vote AGAINST Trump. I can‚Äôt let this country fall apart because the Democratic candidates may not be my number one pick or even close to my preferred candidate.   Sitting out this vote is a sign of unspeakable privilege and selfishness for those in this country and around the world that are suffering under Trump. That would continue suffering for decades because of what the Republicans are doing in the courts.   If this isn‚Äôt enough for you. If voting for the Democratic candidate as a vote against Trump isn‚Äôt enough for you, than fine. You‚Äôre a lost cause perhaps. But don‚Äôt you dare spread that opinion around the internet like a virus.
Until we get the GOP out of the white house and Congress. That will never happen.  We are in such  a big hole any vote for independent is a vote for trump .  Smh.
Even if that were true and the perfect candidate was third party it's too late into this cycle for them to overcome the inbuilt two party bias that our government has from the ground up. Not to say that such a shift isn't possible, our two big parties today are the same two we've always had. Every so often a new party manages to push it's way to the top of the pile but that change doesn't come from the top. Whoever this party is and whatever they're candidates ideals you would see the ground support at the local level first.
Ha! Like who?
This is absolutely not the election.  Edited. I think is pretty obvious that there is a lot of propaganda being pushed in this thread and in Reddit in general. I don‚Äôt know who it is or if they‚Äôre all trolls/bots but keep an eye out for it and downvote it or call it out for what it is.
Unfortunately Joe Exotic is in prison now :(   https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58065ca2e4b0180a36e6a4de/amp
C'mon, be nice and leave your acid wit behind the keyboard.
Warren supporters truly the best
I think you mean democratic socialist. There's something called a Social Democrat which Warren is, who believes in capitalism but also a strong welfare state, it's also what most left leaning economists are.
Oh fucking give it a rest already.  2016 is long over, and if you consider threatening to bust and throw poor people and people of color to the wolves a viable method of maintaining influence, I don't know what you're doing here.
I share what I wish to share. You won't stop me. Biden voted for the worst foreign policy disaster in our modern history. I won't forget it and I'll ensure nobody does. Thousands of Americans, millions of Iraqis, and trillions of dollars GONE because of his decision. It's completely unforgivable. Sorry you find it an acceptable choice just so that your party wins one seat in our government.   >He will be able to appoint more far-right judges in the Supreme Court and around the country. Women will lose rights. Minorities will lose rights. LGBTQ+ people will lose rights.   Has this happened yet? No. Even RBG has come out to support the justices that have been put on the bench. Talk about hyperbole from you. Oh, and who voted for those justices? Congress. You act as if he's doing this alone and that his seat alone is what's most important.  >Sitting out this vote is a sign of unspeakable privilege and selfishness for those in this country and around the world that are suffering under Trump.   I won't sit out. I've never sat out of an election. I just pick a different candidate.   >but we need to call out the unacceptably of this rhetoric.   You find this unacceptable? HA! what a fucking joke. You find my disgust with his decision to be more unacceptable than the fact he voted for a war that sent thousands of our people to their graves over NOTHING! I find it unacceptable that you've either forgotten or forgiven this tragedy.  And what led to Trump wasn't this. What led to Trump was ignoring the entire Midwest and allowing a shit candidate that voted for the Iraq war to win the nomination.
So maybe we shouldn't support someone who's going to blindly back anyone solely bc they belong to the same political party?
Yes! Thank you :)
Please don't shoot, I'm on your side!  In all seriousness, I don't mean to attack Democrats in general. I do think DNC leadership had a clear favorite in the race, and much as I liked Clinton, I think that was wrong and should be called out. I will give the DNC credit for staying pretty neutral this time around, though.
If you still believe this after 4 years of Trump, you're either dangerously naive or just plain trying to promote conservative interests.
DNC did have a favorite, but it's not like they had the power to do anything. If they had power, and all of them really hated Bernie, then he would not have been allowed to run as a democrat, and he definitely would not have gotten over 40% of the primary vote.
I'm not trying to piss people off but it's a little rich that some prominent voices who spent months saying how awful Warren was compared to Bernie are now furious at Warren for failing to endorse him. - Nate Silver
Warren, the Schrodinger's Progressive evidently.
Just going to leave this here: https://twitter.com/dianelyssa/status/1236737289361010689?s=21
A while ago I made a timeline of Nathan Robinson's descent into Warren-induced insanity  worth a look again  https://i.imgur.com/rEtj43z.png
Working Families Party who previously endorsed Warren has came out and now endorsed Bernie and even his supporters are in an uproar over that. Like, if that doesn't even make them happy, an endorsement from Liz isn't not gonna make a difference. It's absolutely ridiculous.
Bernie has been running this campaign for 6 years now? Longer?  Bernie dragged everyone further to the left, and I thank him for that - but - it's not Warrens fault after all this time (and name recognition) that his numbers overwhelmingly shrunk.
Fuck those hypocrites.   Her polices were so similar to his and she was willing to say how she was really going to get these seemingly impossible policies over the finish line and commit to it. If they really want the progressive agenda like they say, and don't just follow Bernie as an infallable demigod, then Warren would have had WAY more support.   They don't want policies, they want magic.   Bernie gets in office:   Day 1 - \**POOF** All student debt is gone!   Day 2 - \**SHAZAM** Everyone has great health insurance and never has to pay a thing!   Day 3 - \**BADA BING BADA BOOM ** All state colleges throw open their doors free of charge while still accepting and/or graduating the same number of students!
And this was just published on Buzzfeed:  >Last weekend, a few days after Elizabeth Warren dropped out, Shakir and one of his deputy campaign managers, Ari Rabin-Havt, started contacting her top staffers and supporters to see what could be done to bring together the two camps before the primaries on Tuesday.  >Sanders spoke to Warren a ‚Äúhandful‚Äù of times throughout the week, a campaign aide confirmed, but she has declined to offer her endorsement.  >Several leading figures in Warren‚Äôs circle balked at the outreach effort ‚Äî Sanders and his aides, they said, had months to lay the groundwork for that kind of partnership, but only did so this week from a position of desperation. About a month ago, when it was clear that Warren had little chance to win, one such person said they put out feelers to Sanders‚Äôs operation in an attempt to start a running conversation. They showed little interest, the person said, in reciprocating.  https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-joe-biden-campaign  He does not run good campaigns. This was malpractice on the part of the Sanders campaign and they only have themselves to blame.
Nathan J Robinson is insufferable, an absolute child. I went to his feed last night for a bit of Sch√§denfreude and immediately regretted it. Lesson learned.

To some, Elizabeth was simultaneously "a fake progressive" but also "doing damage to the progressive movement by not backing Bernie".
Fwiw - Sanders was done a massive disservice by many of the official and unofficial spokespeople for his campaign. They gave license to an overly combative style of politics that left no room for anyone that wasn‚Äôt 100% bought in.   They should‚Äôve had people who speak in more inclusive and humble rhetoric similar to how Khanna, AOC, and Jayapal present.  I‚Äôm pretty damn progressive, but I looked at that campaign and I didn‚Äôt see any room for someone like me who has their own ideas about education and science policy. If your campaign is scaring someone away who‚Äôs with you on 95% of your platform, that‚Äôs a big problem.
And defending Bernie staying in to the bitter end while demanding Warren drop out even before super Tuesday.
The more I see, the more I‚Äôm convinced that Biden is simply the correct candidate for the moment. The turnout numbers are simply incredible. The people who didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary in 2016 are back, they‚Äôre ready to vote for Joe, and if they do, Trump simply doesn‚Äôt have a path to victory. I support a progressive agenda, but nothing is more important than removing Donald Trump.  That said, it‚Äôs hard to make a good faith argument that Warren wasn‚Äôt the stronger progressive candidate. If she‚Äôd performed the same as Sanders in IA, NH & NV, her campaign would have read the tea leaves. If you want to win, it‚Äôs time to grow the base. Quickly. It‚Äôs time to get inclusive. Pronto. Sanders simply didn‚Äôt employ people who had any interest in running a campaign that attracted people who didn‚Äôt already skew toward their ideology, in a year where we‚Äôre clearly seeing that ideology is irrelevant. You see the result.
Sucked it up yesterday and voted for Bernie because he was the last progressive in the race. I was not excited to do so after all of the horrible things his camp has hurled towards Liz. Sanders failed to expand his support beyond his core group of supports and now they're all in denial that their candidate is through. They're all looking for someone else to blame and Warren is an easy scapegoat. They live in a bubble.
I'm not a fan of Biden, but what numbers is Nathan talking about? It looked like Bernie was pretty solidly under Biden there. Even if he got a 6% jump from a Warren endorsement he would not have won.
Truth.

Yeesh.  Also, hello neighbor.
God damn that comment thread...
Yep. This is quintessential Sandersism to me: they are absolutely convinced that they are right, and anyone who disagrees is not just "a person with a different viewpoint," but the enemy. It can produce an ideologically pure, militantly loyal fanbase, but is off putting to everyone else.   If Sanders (and his acolytes like Robinson) were more flexible and accepting of alternative views, they could build a larger coalition. I loved Warren because she had progressive opinions but didn't act as if someone who was even *slightly* more moderate than she was must be a malevolent corporate shill trying to oppress the proletariat.
I'm just so... over the entitlement culture between both Bernie and Biden... I'm not even a gosh darned Democrat (unaffiliated, thank you very much)... I was happy to vote for Warren because she actively worked to earn my vote and clearly articulated how she intended to help my neighbors. In the last couple days, I've had Bernie voters straight out lie about her, saying she supported conversion therapy and was a  "corporate whore"... and I've had Biden supporters straight up tell me that if I don't vote for whoever the Democratic candidate is, that I'm as bad as Trump, and Democrats will physically assault me (mind you, I don't believe them) if they found out I didn't vote for Biden.  As indicated, I'm not a Democrat, so... no, I don't really feel like anyone is entitled to my vote...  I said I'm willing to vote for Joe, but I want him to actively change some of his positioning to earn my vote, namely I want:   1) codifying a ban on private prisons at all levels.   2) ending mandatory minimums and dealing with overincarceration of Americans   3) ending family separation for asylum seekers and providing free DNA testing to reunite affected families where no paperwork was done.   4) commit to fully universal healthcare... I'm not married to single payer, but "uninsured American" needs to be a thing of the past   5) meaningfully address the drag 1.5T in student loan debt and unaffordable university education plays in making it so employers cant afford to hire American graduates at similar rates as their foreign counterparts.   And people jumped all over me for being privileged (I am), and asked who I thought I was to demand politicians have policies that help my neighbors. It's all really farking weird right now, because I thought that was the whole point of even having a democracy...  Sen Warren's campaign was the first time I'd ever volunteered for anything political... and tbh, I hate this process so very very much. I'll back her if she runs again, but tbh, I don't feel like this process is very constructive or useful. There's one team that wants a shitty status quo "nothing will fundamentally change"... and another that seems to just be absolutely bonkers, to the point they're trying to cut CDC funding during a pandemic. It doesn't feel like anyone wants to fix anything, and the one thing the status quo people and the bananas people agree on is that those of us who think thinks need to be fixed shouldn't even be talked to, let alone negotiated with. Then there's this weird faction of people who I could hypothetically agree with on policy, but they're also f\*cking insane, they call me mean things in the very same sentence they demand my support.  As a work from home aspy, I freely admit that being social isn't my thing, and my interactions with people can be frustrating for them as much as me... but I don't really feel like I have a place in politics. =/
I mean kamala, pete, Amy, and others have all endorsed biden after getting into riffs with him. I dont know why there is this double standard with Bernie and warren.

Nate Silver is very divisive.  Pollsters should not also be pundits. It's irresponsible to do science that way.
The way that Twitter works is controversial stuff gets higher than many of the kind and positive Bernie supporters... Just keep in mind that but everything you see on Twitter, Facebook and other apps aren't always the majority of supporters for a candidate.  Living in a social media bubble can skew information in a variety of ways.. It would be nice to see how social media platforms push out information to gain attention and user engagement
"Beggin'" by Madcon captures Bernie's desperation:  >Beggin', beggin' you   Put your loving hand out baby   Beggin', beggin' you   Put your loving hand out darling   >   >...   >   >I'm on my knees when I'm (beggin')   Cause I don't want to lose (you)   I got my arms on spread   And I hope that my heart gets fed, matter of fact girl I'm beggin'  Keep beggin'. Cause you know it's [too little too late](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaSs9z8e6YI)!
Look at all the things the other candidates said about Joe Biden and they still endorsed him.
The weird thing is, I've got progressive ideas in line with Warren's. But if Warren supporters started being aggressive or rude online, I don't think I'd stop believing and striving for said progress ideas.
How is this a pro-Warren post and not just simply an anti-Bernie (via his supporters) post? Nate Silver is the worst...
He's not trying to piss anyone off, he's trying to pit progressives against each other to maintain the corporate/banker status quo.
Honest to God how would you guys feel if the situation was reversed and Bernie failed to endorse Warren? Would you still be saying "yes Bernie can do what he wants" or would you say "wow I can't believe Bernie is being so stubborn, just like in 2016, he'll sink our campaign!".
Outside the box:  *She has betrayed every single progressive ideal that has ever existed*  Inside the box: *the differences between Bernie and Liz are minuscule and we need to band together to save progressivsm*
Damn, you nailed it
This shit on Reddit:  Bernie-or-Buster: I was considering Warren until she called Sanders sexist and tried to make this whole thing about gender! So much for being the unity candidate! üêçüêçüêç  Also Bernie-or-Buster: JESUS WARREN SUPPORTERS WTF NOT UNITING UNDER A CANDIDATE JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE MEAN TO YOU ONLINE GUESS YOU WERE NEVER REALLY PROGRESSIVES   Bonus - what actually happened:   The contents of a private conversation between two candidates was leaked to the media - the source of which was unclear - alleging that Sanders had told Warren he didn't believe a woman could win against Trump. The media had a field day with this and asked them about it at the next debate.   Sanders claimed he "never said a woman couldn't be president" - which was not the allegation - then went on about campaigning for Clinton. When Warren was asked about it, she said she disagreed, then immediately pivoted to general terms, talking about how women had been winning elections recently. This was apparently enough for the toxic Sanders base to alienate anyone in the Warren camp, but feel entitled to their vote after doing everything they could to tear her down.   You can have a heart attack and then lie about releasing your medical records, you can dismiss any call to release details on paying for your plans, you can show up with a bleeding eyeball, you can fail to finish a coherent thought in any debates - but god forbid you don't apologize and change your story if a male candidate says "nuh-uh" while at the same time being a woman.

I think the argument a lot of fanatic Bernie supporters make is that the fact that she didn't endorse is proof that she's more the former than the latter.  Not that I agree with that argument, mind you, just wanted to share how those folks generally frame it.
That‚Äôs a great take.  Reminds me of the contradicting arguments people made about Dubya  Is he a bumbling dumb hick who we should be worried about with the nuclear codes?  Or is he the leader of a vast conspiracy doing the bidding of the military industrial complex while systematically destroying the social safety net?
[removed]
That's amazing.  He calls for unity when Sanders is ahead, and then the moment Warren pulls ahead in the polls, he starts viciously attacking her.
LOL.  That should be used in a gender studies court about what male entitlement looks like.
What a dick.
gee, his dramatic anti-warren about-face happened to coincide with warren topping the polls, what a coincidence i'm sure... /s
Emotional/motivated reasoning in action.
I honestly don't understand how and why a respected newspaper entertains this troll.
To be clear Warren should have endorsed Bernie, but this was his election he blew it on his own. People should apply the same arguments they make to Hillary Clinton fans angry at Bernie for staying in too long in 2016.
They're gonna lose no matter what because they've always been better at burning bridges than building them, and they didn't learn a damned thing from 2016.
I don't think his numbers shrunk, I think it's that they were artificially high.  538 did some in depth analysis a while back and found that about 20% of his 2016 vote was "never Hillary" people instead of "true" supporters. Those people didn't show up obviously this time around and when it became a head-to-head race you see that in the Michigan result, it seems like they were pretty much on the money.  He expanded his core group of supporters, but not enough.
Also, Biden has been doing really well with Warren‚Äôs core constituency. That‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre too dumb to figure out that Sanders is close policy-wise.  It‚Äôs because she had a coalition that was fairly broad in terms of ideology, united by their belief that she was the best person for the job. Without Warren in the race, that constituency went their different ways.
I really think in 20-30 years when we look back he‚Äôll be warmly remembered as someone who brought attention to very real problems that Americans face.  I think Warren, assuming a Biden Presidency, will be the one to really attack those issues in Congress though.
> Her polices were so similar to his and she was willing to say how she was really going to get these seemingly impossible policies over the finish line and commit to it. If they really want the progressive agenda like they say, and don't just follow Bernie as an infallable demigod, then Warren would have had WAY more support.  HUGE FACTS.  Even though I like Bernie's seemingly more progressive stances better, I supported Warren because she was the real deal. She seemed like she could have actually gotten things to actually work.
Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of the bada bing bada boom.  It‚Äôs more effective than ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù

Bernie Sanders is extremely talented at inspiring ~30-35% of Democrats in his policies and his ideology. And those policies have become much more popular within the party and the country as a direct result of his effectiveness in messaging them.  He's also terrible at building bridges to the other 70-65% to create a majority that's needed to actually seize power and get those policies implemented.
[Oh my God. He truly doesn't get it.](https://mobile.twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1237552441282842624)  I'm sorry to say that I ever thought he was smart.
Dude's crazy. Saw a video posted by him trying argue that Warren supporters should switch to supporting Bernie. I expected, you know, arguments, but instead it was like 30 mins of him rambling about why Sanders is "better" without any substantive points at all. I pointed out that the points being made weren't particularly persuasive if you weren't already a Bernie supporter and started getting attacked. Decided to unsubscribe from /r/BreadTube at that time. Heaven forbid I try to engage in discussion...
I just can't take a person who takes fashion tips from the Joker seriously
NUCLEAR take.
I just can't get over the sense of entitlement, candidate and supporters alike.

I agree with you. I think what you described is a cultural problem. The culture of Bernie‚Äôs campaign was and is exactly what you described: combative. But the reality of it is that culture is set at the top. His leadership style fosters this kind of othering and divisive rhetoric. Look at Warren‚Äôs campaign for a true progressive culture built on inclusion with coalition building as an objective. That culture came from Warren. If Bernie wanted his campaign to be about building a coalition then his campaign would sound like it wanted to build a coalition, especially after he won Nevada and was the strong favorite. He could have switched to more inclusive rhetoric. But he didn‚Äôt. His argument and campaign is predicated on having a Goliath to rage against.  The problem there is that the enemy he sees is actually a bunch of voters who aren‚Äôt billionaires, but are normal, worried citizens. So when he scolds us about the establishment and the other dog whistle terms he and his followers use (neoliberals, Democratic establishment, corporatists, etc.) he‚Äôs actually just talking about the people he needs votes from. He‚Äôs talking about white middle class suburban women, economically diverse black voters, older minority and immigrant voters... there aren‚Äôt enough billionaire votes to swing an election. If Biden and Bloomberg have shown us anything so far this primary, it‚Äôs that money is weirdly not that important. Biden won states so far that he didn‚Äôt spend a single dollar in and that he didn‚Äôt even campaign in. Bernie spent money in those states. Bloomberg spent a half a billion dollars for... American Samoa. Rage all you like, Bernie, but the Democratic Establishment is made up of a coalition of black and female and immigrant voters, not a bunch of money.
Exactly. I still disagree with the principle Joe is selling that Trump is an aberration and we‚Äôll go back to normal, instead of what progressives see that Trump is a symptom of a deeper rot in the system. But voters are now demonstrably believing that message. It helps that The one thing propping up Trump (the economy) is tumbling down. Also helps that Biden is very popular among middle aged and older Democrats (you know, the blocs that vote).  The Bernard Brothers are stuck on this ideological purity that only an explicitly progressive candidate (and apparently only one is that according to them) can win and implement said policy. Politics is a team sport.
>  I support a progressive agenda, but nothing is more important than removing Donald Trump.  Yup.  Really, most of a progressive agenda depends on Congress.  Republican Senate == no progress.  Small Democratic majority == modest progress, held back by conservative or timid Democratic congresspeople.  Big Democratic majority == bold progress.  So winning Congress and winning it big is the most progressive thing anyone can do.    > That said, it‚Äôs hard to make a good faith argument that Warren wasn‚Äôt the stronger progressive candidate.   Yeah, why Sanders entered when there was already a candidate with a very similar agenda, except better fleshed out and explained... sigh.  I guess you could argue he foresaw that name recognition would be all that really mattered and he had more than her, but I don't know that that was foreordained.
Yeah, the turn out numbers for Biden in Michigan are promising.  He seems to have inspired a lot of support that I thought were gone forever for Trump.  As long as he can minimize his gaffes (and  he picks a dynamic female VP whom we can get behind) then I think he is not only going to defeat Trump fairly handily, but his coat tails will deliver on down ticket races as well.
Honestly, my biggest problem with Biden isn't his politics. The Obama era neoliberal agenda was good enough for me for 8 years. It'll be a huge improvement over the trump administration.  But the undeniable fact is Biden's health has deteriorated significantly in the past four years. There's a reason why his staff keeps his stump speeches short, his interviews minimal, and his debate performance have been rambling. In terms of his mental health, I feel for the guy. In terms of this election, I'm terrified to see him go up against trump.  It's not just that trump thrives off of belittling insults and shouting over people. It's that his base loves when he does it, while Biden's base expects something more.  Even if Biden can show up on the debate stage and yell and rant on par with trump, it's just not going to be as beneficial for his campaign as it will be for trump's.
> they‚Äôre ready to vote for Joe, and if they do, Trump simply doesn‚Äôt have a path to victory.   Trump has a pretty clear path in a 1v1 televised debate. Biden, as much as I used to like him as VP, has a hard time putting sentences together at this point while Donald‚Äôs bread and butter is his rhetoric. All it takes is a few slip ups and Don will be all over him making him look outclassed.    Unfortunately politics is mostly professional wrestling at this point. It doesn‚Äôt matter who has better policy, but who can cut a better promo.
Joe Biden would veto healthcare reform... Being a moderate doesn't draw in moderate voters, hence Hillary losing in the swing states. There's absolutely nothing moderate about Trump, and yet Hillary who's as moderate as possible couldn't get them to go out and support her.  Moderates who make gaff after gaff, give lengthy answers with no actual substance, and are easy to paint as "the establishment" are exactly the kind of candidate that plays perfectly into Trump's narrative. Carefully rehearsed statements focus grouped to appeal to as many demographics as possible backfire against someone like Trump. They make him seem authentic, and far more dangerously, they make people see him as honest.
Oh he didn't fail to expand support, he lost support. The white working class Midwestern is all in on Biden. Bernie had them 4 years ago.
I honestly don‚Äôt know what I would have done if she had dropped out before I was able to vote for her in the primary. I admit I agree with Bernie on more things than Biden, but I also think he‚Äôs an ego maniac who is blaming the ~~deep state~~  establishment for his inability to expand his base. I think it sucks that he decided to enter the race shortly after Warren because Warren is actually someone who can pull moderates left, whereas Bernie is clueless on how to do this.
I consider myself a progressive through and through, but I truly do not like Bernie Sanders nor the way that he's run this campaign. The rhetoric of "us vs them", fighting the "establishment" and the lack of Democratic establishment endorsements sends up huge red flags for me. The fact that I, a fellow progressive (though I think I'm going to start using the term 'Warren Democrat'), don't feel welcome in Bernie's coalition and movement is indicative of his inability to expand his coalition and hell, even hold onto his base from 2016 (I was an enthusiastic supporter in 2016).
https://twitter.com/NathanJRobinson/status/1237547568134930433?s=20  It looks like Nathan is responding to another person, Sana Saeed (no idea who she is), claiming that some unspecified CNN analyst said Warren voters went on to vote for Biden in the MI primary. They‚Äôre both implying (or rather explicitly stating) that Warren is the reason Bernie didn‚Äôt do well. It‚Äôs a bad look and they‚Äôre just looking for someone to blame rather than take accountability.
Why is that?
Howdy hoo, neighborino!
(1) Because the riffs were nowhere nearly as bad.  (2) Because they all want to leverage their endorsement in exchange for jobs in the next administration. (3) Bernie is sinking. Warren already is facing embarrassment because she lost the MA primary, I doubt she‚Äôll lower her standing more and risk burning bridges with the next President by endorsing a candidate who will go on to lose spectacularly. (4) This likely isn‚Äôt even why she‚Äôs not endorsing him. Remember she did the same in 2016. It was because she was thinking strategically; it was clear a progressive wouldn‚Äôt be able to win the nomination‚Äî so she chooses to inject some progressivism into the moderate who could. It was a case of pushing for progressive policies in the absence of a viable progressive candidate.
The dumb media/twitter narrative that Bernie & Warren are "progressive" and everyone else was a "moderate".  Never mind that Yang's UBI would mean more gov't spending than all of Bernie's plans combined.
Turns out Warren's team tried to start building coalition a month ago.  "Several leading figures in Warren‚Äôs circle balked at the outreach effort ‚Äî Sanders and his aides, they said, had months to lay the groundwork for that kind of partnership, but only did so this week from a position of desperation. About a month ago, when it was clear that Warren had little chance to win, one such person said they put out feelers to Sanders‚Äô operation in an attempt to start a running conversation. They showed little interest, the person said, in reciprocating."  https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rubycramer/bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-joe-biden-campaign?ref=bfnsplash
Because Biden's camp didn't attack his opponents on such a personal level?  Because Biden's side didn't dole out emojis as shorthand for saying "fuck off" to everyone else?   Because those others may see themselves aligned with Biden, but Warren doesn't see herself aligned with Sanders?   Just b/c she was in the "middle" and leaned left doesn't mean she thinks Sanders has a good approach to governing. Indeed, if his sordid campaign people with their 3rd-party votes and vitriol at Democrats is a reflection of who he is--and it is--then that completely contradicts how Warren views the Democratic party and how to lead.   They are not interchangeable.
Those "riffs" weren't actual riffs. They were largely performative and meant to show each candidate's 'toughness.'  What happened between Sanders and Warren was different. Warren sounded seriously pissed when she said, "Did you just call me a liar?" after that CNN debate. And, in her Rachel Maddow interview she said, "The conversation was short," when referring to a conversation she had with Sanders about his supporters' behavior. Or, in other words, he blew her off.  The impression I got was that Warren felt disrespected, and that her concerns weren't being taken seriously by Sanders.

Do you think it is possible that she is still striving for that progress, but just in a different way? That there are ways to strive for progress (especially looking long-term) that have nothing to do with Bernie?
I don‚Äôt think anyone is giving up on their values. Why would you say that? Stop being weird, oh Bernie‚Äôs fan base.
Oh look, it's 2016 again! So predictable.
He already failed to endorse Warren back when he had a heart attack and Warren had all the momentum.  IF he had endorsed her then, progressives may have had a chance.  OR at the very least refrained from attacking her on m4a from the left (which was fucking ludicrous to do to your ally on an issue that is supposedly important to you).  I dont really give a fuck what Bernie or his supporters think anymore.  Their behavior torpedoed any hope progressives had of winning this election.  Warren showed she was more adept at pulling moderates over to progressive policies than Bernie who is adept at repelling his closest allies and shrinking his coalitions.  But truthfully, progressives didnt have the numbers this election no matter what path would have been taken.  Liz, Bernies, and Pete's numbers at their peaks would not have been enough.
And making a woman responsible for a man's words or actions, including putting the onus on her to dig him out of the hole he put himself into by his own words is gender politics writ large.  Note that when Yang dropped out, his supporters did not DEMAND that he endorse Sanders.  Even though Yang was a Sanders supporter in 2016.  Because Yang is a man.  And men get to have agency.  Women, on the other hand, are only as valuable as their loyalty to a man; and she is expected to sublimate her own ambitions to serve that man's ambitions even when doing so would actually put her future at a disadvantage.
That's such a blatant simplification though. She could have chosen to say that this was a misunderstanding and come to agree and show their similarities. She could have chosen to not refuse that terrible CNN behavior. But she didn't, and she accepted the sexist smear in her name. That's what people were upset about.   What's happened to Warren is unfortunate since that's what's happened to Bernie supporters since 2015, and some should be more considerate and less violently vocal. But I think what Bernie supporters - and some Warren supporters - can unite around is they see a structural problem in America, and that structure has colossal power to support suppression of dissent across all fields. Being angry at what the US looks like today is a pretty fair response. It's not an excuse for being toxic, but I think it's fair to say that people who stand in the way of such a movement while claiming they aren't shouldn't be surprised some are upset.  Edit: Alright we‚Äôll clearly not get anywhere in this discussion since I can only see generic talking points or the same arguments that I already tried to reply to. I get it, you‚Äôre pissed, I am sad for how this turned out. You truly do deserve to be pissed and I don‚Äôt want to take that away from you. I stand by what I wrote but there‚Äôs no point in arguing this because we won‚Äôt get anywhere
[538: There‚Äôs No Guarantee Warren Voters Will Line Up Behind Sanders](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-no-guarantee-warren-voters-will-line-up-behind-sanders/)  >[Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/05/sanders-biden-can-expect-near-equal-gain-from-warrens-exit/), for instance, found that 43 percent of Warren supporters would opt for Sanders as their second choice, while 36 percent would choose Biden. And [a recent Ipsos/Reuters poll](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-03/topline_reuters_2020_election_tracker_03_05_2020.pdf) found that Warren supporters‚Äô second-choice loyalties were evenly split, with 47 percent picking Sanders, and 46 percent backing Biden.  And, no, *it wouldn't have made a difference*, because Biden+Bloomberg is more than Sanders+Warren. There were also other people Sanders could have gotten an endorsement from, but who didn't endorse him. Yang didn't. Booker didn't. Gilibrand didn't. Castro didn't. Beto didn't. Harris said she didn't want to endorse while her "friends" were still running, and endorsed Biden *after* Warren dropped out. And, hell, Tulsi Gabbard is still running instead of endorsing Bernie.  It's not Warren's fault. What is Bernie and his campaign doing to bring in a wider coalition? Why are his natural allies alienated from him? This is on his shoulders.
>The possibility of a Sanders nomination was real, which is why the moderates in the race acted so quickly to consolidate support after South Carolina. Had the progressive wing of the party done the same, I think Bernie would have won Super Tuesday and would be riding the momentum that Joe is riding.  Respectfully, I think this is a fantasy. The American electorate turned out in droves and overwhelmingly supported Biden. Warren endorsing Bernie the day before Super Tuesday would not have changed that in a significant way. People just aren't all the way there yet on progressive policy positions.
Bernie would never accomplish any of his platform. He lacks the talent to work with others. Warren saw that. Everyone outside of the Bernie bubble saw that.   Warren shouldn‚Äôt extend a divisive primary and she knew that. Bernie‚Äôs loss last night should be hard enough that he finally stops attacking others because there isn‚Äôt any hope left for his presidency.
Yeah it is. She isnt required to support anyone, she's her own independent human with her own decisions to make in her own time and everyone can just sit the fuck down and be patient, and if she doesn't decide to endorse either of the old ass white dudes who have been repeatedly sexist to her, then more fucking power to her honestly because I wouldn't want to endorse them if I was her either. It's HER choice. of course all these old dudes want her to sit down and be quiet but also endorse them and do whatever they say. They, INCLUDING Bernie, want her to be the perfect patriarchal view of what a "woman" should be. Agree with them, support them, be nice, be pleasant. Fuck that. They fucked up and they can deal with the fucking consequences. They can win this race on their own, they shouldn't need to rely on the endorsement of someone they've spent months demonizing. Not her problem.
Bernie literally had the nomination in his fingers after the resounding victory in Nevada.  Most voters were still undecided at this point and susceptible to his messaging. Did he try to unify the party and pivot towards unity to bring in suburban moderates and southern blacks with the strength of his electability argument?   No. He stated that the Republican Establishment and the Democratic Establishment were out to get him (while he was the fucking frontrunner for the Democratic party) and embarked on a Fidel Castro apology tour. Don't blame the electorate for the Bernie's asinine campaigning skills.
You are severely underestimating how damaging Bernie‚Äôs surrogate attacks on Warren supporters actually were.
Where could her endorsement have made a difference? Sure, maybe Washington. That‚Äôs it.  Biden is winning the nomination because he‚Äôs winning the black voters in the South. That, and the suburban women who voted HRC in 2016 and this cycle were stuck between Pete, Amy and Liz. They hate Bernie. They‚Äôll settle for Bernie. No, her endorsement wouldn‚Äôt have changed a damn thing.
I want to preface this by saying Bernie was always my number two. I'm fine with her not endorsing one or the other.  By the time Warren dropped out, a lot of her support had already migrated to Bernie (or perhaps others) in a few waves:  * The first wave was in the fall when she was smeared for "walking back" medicare for all. She was on pace to be the front runner and then her numbers dropped and Bernie's numbers rose. * The second came when the she said/he said situation occurred in January, and she was called a snake based on her interpretation of their discussion. * The last wave came after her 4th place finish in New Hampshire. People lost faith and switched to other candidates after two states had voted.  So, what you're left with is likely 2 kinds of supporters which supports the approximately 50/50 divide for where her supporters would go - people who like her well-researched, progressive policies and remained persistent until the end (probably would vote Bernie based on policy); and people who supported her because her policies were detailed and she brought receipts (may not vote for Bernie because they're not that progressive, but value pragmatism rather than grand gestures).
Except even if Bernie were to be the Democratic candidate, he would lose to Trump in a landslide. [Radical candidates galvanize support in the opposition.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/opinion/negative-partisanship-democrats-republicans.html)
You're getting downvotes, but as a person who has been on a similar journey (1st choice: Elizabeth, 2nd choice: Bernie) I think these two things might have made a difference:  * Yang immediately and fervently endorses Bernie upon dropping out of the race. * Warren immediately and fervently endorses Bernie upon dropping out of the race.  Those two along could really have swayed people.   But what you have to understand is that people like Yang and Warren are smart enough to understand that if you don't play the game to some extend, you have no voice what so ever. Obama also understood that.  They made a calculated choice because they understand how all of this really works. The gross part that is all a ridiculous power struggle. And they may have done the right thing.  Now our job is to make sure that we don't tear down our candidates and create ammunition for the other side in the general. And to get a Dem in office. And to participate earlier and stronger next time to get an actual progressive and good candidate a fair chance.
your username is literally "NRA 4eva," why should anyone believe you were ever a warren supporter?
She needs to take a good hard look at Bernie's slogan. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'd be like "wtf Bernie, why haven't you endorsed her yet?!"  If Trump beats Biden, all these prominent endorsers should get voted out.
I am disappointed by how many of my fellow Sanders supporters (and the campaign and even the candidate) failed to go big tent the way they needed too.  Bernie framing Buttigieg and Klobuchar‚Äôs decisions to drop out as succumbing to pressure from ‚Äúthe Democratic establishment‚Äù was not the way to win votes.  I am grateful for high-profile Sanders supporters  like [AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC), [Ro Khanna](https://twitter.com/RoKhanna), and [Pramila Jayapal](https://twitter.com/PramilaJayapal) who have all taken the high road.   Like Elizabeth Warren, they‚Äôre my kind of Democrats and they give me tremendous hope for the future of our party.
The only value they see in a woman is loyalty.........to a man.  It's sexism incarnate.  They  did not do the same thing to Yang.  Even though Yang was a Bernie supporter in 2016.  They left him alone.  Because they respected his agency.  They did not demand his loyalty.  They did not feel entitled to it.  That's all you need to know to understand that this is gender politics writ large.
i mean, they've been making that argument since the fall of last year but it's definitely a "have cake & eat it" paradox.
In general, I thought that it was assumed that Dubya was the idiot figurehead and the eminence grise was Cheney.
I'm not a Warren supporter because she deserves to be President, I'm a supporter because America deserves a President Warren.
I don't necessarily know if America deserves her, but we sure as hell need her.  This is a great post.    I support Warren because we absolutely do need her.  I think she is the unique candidate who can fix what Trump has broken, fix it so we can't have another Trump-like presidency  and make significant improvements to Americans' lives, all at the same time.
I just look at the field and it seems so obvious that she is uniquely qualified for this moment. Assuming we win, the new POTUS is facing an executive branch in total disarray that needs re-staffing from top to bottom, a recession around the corner, and corruption oozing from every office. It‚Äôll be one of the most difficult transitions in history and whoever it is will need unimaginable discipline. If they don‚Äôt right the ship, we‚Äôll have Don Jr in office before the decade‚Äôs out.   The only candidate who could possibly not make a total hash of it is Liz who has stood up a federal agency from nothing, is a sucker for finding exploitable loopholes that need closing, Wall St knows she knows where the skeletons are buried, and she had a front row seat to the mistakes made in 2008.   I don‚Äôt trust Bernie‚Äôs staffing, Amy‚Äôs will to hold the Trump admin accountable (based on her confirmation of so many judges), Biden‚Äôs age, Bloomberg‚Äôs anything, and I can‚Äôt even with any donor or politician thinking the answer is a 38 year old who‚Äôs only experience is doing a mediocre job running a small city.
This deserves a standing ovation! üëèüëèüëè
Thank you. It's clear, concise, inspiring but not sentimental.   I love everything about it.   Are you a speech writer? If not, you should consider it.
She is the smartest person in the room.
I support Warren because she's the only candidate aside from Yang who seems to actually have a plan to fix the nation's issues. Bernie's popular but I don't think he would actually back up his promises.
I will read the entire post before commenting.
We don't deserve her. We need her.
I disagree. This country elected Trump (yes due to an antiquated system among other things). We do not DESERVE Warren, but dammit we need her.
I don‚Äôt know that we deserve her at this point, but we need her.
She‚Äôs our once-in-a-lifetime, *this-is-our-lifeline* candidate

I'm a Klobuchar supporter but Warren is my second choice.  I would be very pleased to see her President.

Yes, America elected Trump, and doesn't deserve President Warren. Definitely a necessity though if America is to have a brighter future.
She's our Batwoman.
Do you trust Bernie's will to hold Trump admin accountable? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. But I trust Warren to do this completely.

Millions of Americans have fought since 2016 and their hard work saw a victory in 2016.  Millions of americans fought hard and saw victory in 2008 and 2016  Millions of american, though, have fought hard since the shift of the democratic party in the 60's and have experienced a lifetime of victories and defeats.  While i do believe we earn the president we have in all respects, i simply believe that the faith, dedication, and consistent hard work of generations of democratic supporters, donators, field workers, and politicians is such that we deserve to have a cycle where we can rest a little easy in the knowledge that damage is being repaired and that we can trust our government to improve the lives of its citizens rather than select segments of the population.  Millions of us have crawled through broken glass time and time again to see a better tomorrow and i think we all *deserve* that better tomorrow, even those who are not granted enough foresight to see who might ring in such an era.  It's been a long primary season and i've been terribly frustrated for a very long time.

Hating Trump for what he is and having the will to hold Donald Trump accountable are two different things. One does not necessarily lead to the other. The only candidate truly vocal about how she would go on to achieve this and why, has been Warren. Not Bernie, Bernie before the primaries largely avoided this Topic and still seems to do that at times. If you can't really feel the mockery Trump admin/Republicans make of equal justice and the rule of law in the US and somehow you don't feel the need to punish this aggressively, I don't sense the sincerity that you apparently have about this matter. (Referring to Bernie). That said, Bernie's reluctance to broach the matter at times does not mean he may not intend to seek justice. I would really hope he would. The American people need this. The powerful need to be held accountable.
I loved this New Yorker cartoon from earlier in the week
Here is an example to show that this is a real argument they will make via Twitter[.](https://twitter.com/DeanoMartin3/status/1192987625868726272?s=19)  >Look what she's wearing. She always, day in and day out wears the same clothes - black sleeveless leotard top, black  yoga pants, 3/4 sleeve pastel unzipped sweatshirt-type top. This is creepy af. Either she bought bags of the same clothes or she smells ... bad
As a rule, I love the New Yorker but hate their cartoons. This is amazing.
This was in the New Yorker? It doesn't look like their regular style. Also the old joke that they can always be improved with the same replacement caption doesn't work here: "Christ, what an asshole."
Haha this is everything!
Cute. Highlights the difference between EW who is practically an angel and the devil we have in office now with millions of skeletons in his closet. What a relief it would be to have EW as POTUS. The only downside to this cartoon is, it completely obscures the warrior in her when it comes to fighting for a system that works for all of us and not just the 1%!
Elizabeth is who everybody wishes Hillary Clinton actual was.
If you did this for Bernie his fan base would try and carpet bomb the main office.  Even if he did think it was cool.

[removed]
Why not add that she was a Republican for like 30 years?
[removed]
I think the cartoon is sexist.  She‚Äôs obviously a though person and this is minimizing her.
[removed]
betcha they never complained about a man wearing a dark suit everyday
People get snippy when they dont have any real criticism.
Can conform she smells fine and gives a nice side hug when you take "selfies" with her.
Seriously? This is something people actually say? Did they say the same thing about Steve Jobs? jeesh.
Whereas Bernie wears the same rumpled blue suit and he‚Äôs ‚Äúomg so humble‚Äù
For the most part I agree, but when they connect they hit it out of the park.
Emily Flake is the artist, judging by the art style. She‚Äôs hilarious.
[removed]
From the cartoon, I get the sense that this woman would be eaten alive by Trump in the debates. I don't know if it's true for the real Liz, but she should be more fierce on the Dem debates, especially when Biden undermines her.
They‚Äôre extremely different politicians. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to compare them aside from the fact that they‚Äôre women.
I feel bad for Bernie. He's great, but he's attracted some rude and uninformed voters.
Removed for rule one and some other ones too.
Removed: rule one.
A skeleton in your closet is something that‚Äôs a secret, her political career is pretty out in the open
I don‚Äôt think so. This comic was drawn by a woman who‚Äôs a huge Warren supporter.  The gist of it is that she doesn‚Äôt have, for example, several rape accusations against her or any of the other actual serious shit someone like Trump has in his background
While I've never met Elizabeth Warren, she's like a grandma to me. Nothing wrong with being a good person and being nice. I think that this cartoon speaks to her character. In no way does it "minimize her", and to say that it does implies that there is something wrong with not being tough. Besides, Warren is one of the toughest people I've ever seen, next to my badass theater lighting manager and she fought in Vietnam and carries around a container of quarters to give to kids to buy stuff from vending machines. Being cute and old doesn't make you weak.
Madam President* Bruce would be first Man(n)
Nope. And if he does wear a different one? A tan one?
Probably not, or steve jobs who famously only wore black turtlenecks and jeans.
They never paid attention to what [white] men were wearing to begin with.  Klan hoods, nazi armbands, clogs, MAGA hats.
I don't understand this TBH, why would we want or expect a candidate to be a cannibal, have some sort of sex scandal in their past, or some other horrible failing? Is it really that hard to believe that there are people out there that at worst maybe didn't call their mom enough or are a bit awkward sometimes and that's the extent of their "badness".  People like Warren should be who we strive to put in office.
The best I've seen was on a Bernie sub and it was a huge thread trying to answer a comment saying .... "her healthcare plan looks good, will someone find some holes in it that I can use in discussions this week".    Some people's kids, smh
Her hugs are amazing! She‚Äôs so warm and genuine! I got to hug her at Las Vegas Pride and she was literally running all over the place giving hugs and snapping selfies in her giant rainbow boa ‚ù§Ô∏è
[deleted]
Yes, the sense you articulate is my concern with this cartoon. At a live rally, you get to see her integrity, fearlessness and fierce determination. Any concerns about Warren getting pushed around in a debate with Trump were replaced by blissful images of a tough schoolmarm dragging a bully off to detention by the ear while lecturing him on exactly why he was in trouble  In primary debates, I think Liz is motivated to avoid attacking a fellow Democrat. But you may be right that she could benefit from strategic use of some of the sharp slap downs we've seen from her in other forums.
Unfortunately, that's enough for quite a lot of people.
...and that they were both leading their party's nomination when running for President of the United States of America.  I could have compared her to Obama, but I didn't want Obama to be anybody other than who he was.
[removed]
Do you think there is symbolic significance for the a candidate running to be the first female president of the United States
While I agree with you, 100%. It's important to remember that, sexism can be done by women for people they support.
Unacceptable. Almost as bad as preferring Dijon mustard!
[They're fine with tan suits...](https://www.thecut.com/2017/06/mitch-mcconnell-tan-suit.html)  ...as long as you're white.
Were clogs a racist clothing at one time?
Fair to say that most sane people agree with that, but it's different if that basic, boring, good person just isn't *their* quarterback.
Infighting does nothing good. If Warren wins the primary, she will need Sanders supporters, if Sanders wins, he will need Warren supporters.
There are literally hundreds of people who have run for President. Many of them, I assume, were not your ideal candidate - and most of them were men. So, why do you think it‚Äôs necessary to compare Warren to Clinton when they have very little in common other than their gender?
She‚Äôll be exactly like Obama if she comes in office and barely attempts what she campaigned on.
Removed: rule one.
I don't think their point was that women can't be sexist against women even while trying to be supportive. I think the point was that, in this case, with these circumstances and context, it is a mitigating factor rather than an amplifying one.
also see deficits, debt, and executive orders
In all fairness, some of that was just blind partisanship. They attacked Clinton for absurd shit too. Yeah there is racism in the GOP but there is even more blind hatred for democrats.
The article is criticizing him for his terrible suit so.....
You appear to be trying to twist my comment into some sort of gender biased statement.  The significant thing they have in common is that this is the Elizabeth Warren sub Reddit, and I compared her to the previous frontrunner who I happened to think was a really weak pick. I wanted Elizabeth to run in 2016, but was definitely content with Bernie being in the race. We got stuck with poor candidate instead who went on to lose for predictable reasons. I did not compare her to Obama because I liked Obama the way he was as a candidate. The fact that I didn't go back and compare Elizabeth to all of the frontrunners of the past century instead of the most recent races does not make me a sexist asshole which is how I assume you are trying to paint me.
I‚Äôm not trying to twist your comment, or paint you as anything. Honestly. I was only intending to highlight and rebut this problematic way of looking at candidates based on superficial characteristics, which a lot of people do. My comment was less about you and more about our culture‚Äôs reflex of boxing women in in this way.  If we want Warren to succeed as a candidate, we should talk about her on her own merits. Clinton and Warren are radically different candidates in terms of both style and substance. Comparing them in the way you did is not helpful to Warren because it ignores all the ways that she is unique from Clinton and highlights the only real way they are similar, their gender.  Additionally, considering one of Warren‚Äôs greatest weaknesses as a candidate is her ‚Äúelectability‚Äù, which is a word used as a stand-in for uncertainty about a female President - highlighting her gender instead of focusing on her ideas (as we often did to Clinton in 2016) is not helpful.  By the way, the same goes for the non-stop comparisons of every black politician to Obama. People deserve to be judged on their own merits.
First time canvasser! I almost puked from nerves but I still got 5 confirmed Warren voters and a new volunteer.
I did this for the first time last week, and I‚Äôm right there with you, I was super nervous! Every door counts, every phone call is another person who goes out into the world more willing to entertain the dream. Nice work üôåüèΩ
Is it weird to say I'm proud of you?
I‚Äôm with you.  I‚Äôm always a bucket of nerves before I get the first couple of houses out of the way for the day.  It gets easier.  Great on you for getting out!
I love canvassing because you can actually see the people. I've even made friends canvassing. You're doing the real political work now, OP! I'm proud of you taking this action
Woo! If you are in South Washington near Vancouver we might run into each other!
nice work! ‚úä
Just canvassed for the first time yesterday myself. It's a really cool thing to do.
Wow, that's incredible!   I did my first canvassing today (Oakland, CA). I knocked 70 doors, only 10 people answered, I made progress with 2, but did not get any confirmed Warren (most were staunch Sanders supporters).
YES! LFG. Thank you for fighting through your nerves. That's a really big deal. Super thankful for your hard work!
Good work!!
Way to be!
Thank you so much! What state are you in?
Way to go! I knocked a packet this morning in Illinois too!üôå
The more you do it the easier it gets !!
Thank-you for your service.
Amazing work!! Keep at it :)
You did great! Getting a vol is huge for a first timer!
Just canvassed earlier today and got somewhere around 6 Warren supporters, but my favorite was a woman who started out undecided.  When this undecided voter started talking about it, it was clear she wanted to vote for Warren but was afraid that the US isn‚Äôt ready for a woman president. We talked for a while and she went from ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù to ‚Äúyes, definitely‚Äù and feeling like she was excited to vote her heart and help build Warren‚Äôs momentum.   We need to remain visible and vocal because we know that there‚Äôs a lot of supporters of Warren, but that‚Äôs not the narrative of the media, the Russian bots, and lots of others. If we are all vocal and visible, that will help the folks who want to vote for her but are scared.  Warren has a lot of fight left, but we need to do our part!
Thank you for your hard work!
Today was my first day too! Congrats!
That‚Äôs so awesome! I canvassed for the first time last week too! Didn‚Äôt get as many confirmed - we actually only talked to two people lol. That sounds like a really great experience!
I phone banked today! It was great. Will for sure do it again. Way to get out there!
Good job!  First doors the hardest door everytime!  Its all easier and easier from there.    My town's Sander's Team lead always says canvassing is the very best, calls are next best.
You freaking ROCK!!!  Thank you so much for donating your Saturday!  I was nervous, too.  That first door, my heart was pounding.  But the person who answered was about my age, and said it was okay - she helped me take a few deep breaths, and I was able to get out my script.  And then... it just got easier with each door I knocked!  You are awesome!
Tomorrow is my first time! üò¨
Even if Warren doesn't win, this is excellent practice for canvassing in the general!
This is so cool! I have serious anxiety and shy big time from canvassing or phone calls, etc. and I have no money. So I feel like I can‚Äôt help Liz. Since you were also nervous, can I ask you how the experience was??
That's awesome!  I had good fortune today, my first time canvassing for a campaign too!  (Went out briefly 2 weeks ago for Warren).  Scored 5 supporters, and persuaded another 6-8 people into favoring Warren or even vote for her!
That‚Äôs awesome!!! I‚Äôm terrified to canvas, but your post inspired me to canvass next weekend!  üòä
You‚Äôre doing well and it‚Äôs actually building up transferable skills for other areas of life. :)
I'm a Sanders supporter but still proud of you, stand for what you believe in, great work :)
Congratulations! That's great that you got a new volunteer, speaks well of you. Canvassing gets easier with experience. I still get nervous myself, but I'm having longer and better conversations with people who are receptive, and that's quite fulfilling.
No! I am too!
It gets easier and you'll arguments will get better. Congrats to you.
This is a very typical canvassing day IMO. OP did amazing.  Edit: I forgot to add that /u/frisouille did amazing as well, since volunteering in the first place is the stuff of champions.
Way to go! I think I got lucky because I'm in Seattle which is basically the ideal Warren demographic. So even better that you went out in a place where she might need more support.
Washington state. We vote on 3/10.
Love that story! Way to go!
Thanks! It definitely got easier. Next one will be even better I hope.
It was a pretty positive experience. People  I met were kind although many weren't even home. I even had several supporters of other candidates who thanked me for being out supporting democratic candidates. It definitely was hard to do the first few but the app tells you when you're done with every 25% and by 50% it felt pretty easy.
I'm so glad to hear that! The first few are tough but it's easier after that.
I ran into some Sanders canvassers and they were working hard and I was impressed at their organization. It's a good year to be a Democrat!
That‚Äôs fantastic. Thank you for sharing!
Warren warns Facebook may help reelect Trump 'and profit off of it'
Remember Facebook and the media enabled Trump
The type of photos used by The Hill is problematic. What a shitty publication.
Zuck Fuckerberg is an effective gaslighter. There is NOTHING transparent about airing ads full of lies and not fact-checking them. Facebook is entering a dangerous realm here and I hope they pay the price.
FascistBook
Delete Facebook
I've deactivated mine to give it a try, it's actually been pretty peaceful. I'm back to texting people and advanced messaging is as good if not better than Facebook Messenger with no ads. I think in a week I'll buy a bottle of Merlot and make a nice big deal about actually deleting it.
Without Cambridge Analytica using Facebook we would not have Trump as president today
Break them up!
Lol what an unflattering picture. The Hill really does not like Elizabeth.
People who get their news from facebook want to be duped.
[deleted]
I mean twitter does the same thing right? Can we really blame these tech companies for giving him a platform? Or do we blame the idiots dumb enough to keep believing the lies.
It's important to keep in mind that the Facebook drama is ***not*** about free speech, but anti-trust action against corporate monopoly.  Zuckerberg's total control over Facebook does not come from his position as CEO, but the fact that his Facebook stocks give him supreme voting power over any decision-making process on the board of Facebook.  Warren knows that, and she is coming at his Achilles heel.  In the next few months, we will probably see Zuckerberg reveal his true character under pressure. I'm not under the impression that he is a ruthless business person, but he is truly a privileged frat boy stuck in arrested development, and one can only imagine what frat boys do when they are forced to take real responsibility for their mistakes.
I love EW and hate Facebook but this is just a bit hyperbolic
Mark actually wants Yang to win
Enabled Trump? They damn near created him.   He‚Äôd be just another wealthy brat without them.
Fuck Facebook.
It's obvious he just wants to sell more ads and restricting misinformation campaigns would be a huge hit to his bottom line.
Also remember that he has been taking meetings with far right influencers such as tucker Carlson
Maybe it's where I live, but I don't ever see any ads that are crazy like ... it's all for local events or for CBD flower suppliers.  Anyway, I don't doubt the misinformation, but I also don't know how I feel about their job here-- is it beyond a platform vs publisher issue?  Idk, I haven't paid enough attention to it becuase it's outside of my view and news consumption habits for the most part.   Also wanted to say that "Zuck Fuckerberg" is a really fun trick because it's broken my brain at being able to remember Zuckerberg's given name.  Is it Fuck, is it Frank, no ... I think it's Mark, but I don't have the confidence I'd like to have in that. I do know, with confidence, that it's not Tom.
I think advertising in general so such bullshit and lies that FB can't ban misleading ads. They should have a different set of rules for political ads though.
Good idea. I hate relying on fb just to be able to send a theoretical message to some unknown contact at an undetermined point in the future. I've rarely done over the years I've kept my account open just for messenging.  This is probably a good time (although years ago would have been better) to pull the trigger on a plan I've had to start announcing on fb that I'm moving on and how to contact me.  If anyone else has suggestioms for reliable, non-invasive messengers please let me know. Encryption would be noce, but you can always move private chats to a different service.
Speaking of CA, I got my first fake friend message here the other day. Average looking military guy  with no history - so they are still actively working, just fyi.
Of course they don't want to. It would be a huge operational overhead and cost sink for them. It's not as though they're unable to though...they're massive. But they're not going to do so unless compelled to do so by legislation. It just isn't profitable.
They better give those folks insurance for all the mental health help they'll need
Bingo
I highly doubt that.
'wealthy'
More people should just leave. I deleted my Facebook earlier this year and haven't looked back.
Do you know how much Facebook's political ads are as a percentage of its total ad revenue? You should look it up.
 I think the larger problem is any social media having to fact check things at such a massive scale.   It might be slightly easier to just fact check what FB regards to be 'political' ads.   Although they still run into the problem of how to defines/classify 'political'.  As well as how factual something is, which becomes an even larger problem when there might be 4 paragraphs for an ad, but the amount of detail in what it describes could take pages for someone to understand fully as fact.
I'm on Telegram with my family these days.
He would have been wealthy if he just took daddy's money and didn't fuck with it
I‚Äôve seriously considered it but the irony of it is Facebook is how local organizing gets done. I don‚Äôt know how I would keep up with any local political party happening or local candidate organizing without it. We have a decent sized local Elizabeth Warren group going, all done through Facebook.
If you have info to share, just share it.  I used to invest in FB, the earnings beats were always insane during election years. Sold around Cambridge analytica time made something like 120%. Will never buy again.
meetup, then again that is owned by wework which is owned by a bunch of private equity firms.
I definitely do not regret deleting facebook but i will admit i lost touch with a bunch of people because of it.
Earnings and revenue aren't the same thing, and FB's growth didn't change much in 2016. 2012 was a bad year for them. 2018 revenues were bad in some quarters. http://investors.fb.com
Which are owned by the saudis.
The Des Moines Register endorses Senator Elizabeth Warren for the democratic nomination for president
This is wonderful. I just heard an interview saying that the number of undecided voters in Iowa is larger than ever before and this could be the bump we need. Polls are all over the map and she's been gaining or holding steady in many. One or two more small bumps may translate into a huge win.   Donate and voluteer TODAY. Your one text could decide a precinct.
I had a feeling they were leaning that way.  Des Moines Register has more guts than NYT confirmed.
> At this moment, when the very fabric of American life is at stake, Elizabeth Warren is the president this nation needs.
This is great news! But that image (? painting?) of her is weird.   However, their points are strong:  >**Many of her ideas aren't radical. They are right.**   >   >**She must show that her vision will lift people up rather than divide them.**   >   >**She cares about people, and she will use her seemingly endless energy and passion to fight for them.**   >   >The senior U.S. senator from Massachusetts is not the radical some perceive her to be. She was a registered Republican until 1996. She is a capitalist. ‚ÄúI love what markets can do,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey are what make us rich, they are what create opportunity.‚Äù¬†But she wants fair markets, with rules and accountability. She wants a government that works for people, not one corrupted by cash.  And a bit of a swipe at the NY Times:  >The outstanding caliber of Democratic candidates makes it difficult to choose just one.¬†But ultimately Iowa caucusgoers need to do that.
HELL YES LIZ!  ## LFG! ##
I feel so happy. I thought they would've picked Klobuchar. I was prepared for them to do that.  So glad that DMR picked Warren.
Boost we all needed!  **LFG!**  Since this is up, I'll just drop this link here  https://www.tbs.com/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee/primary  Please play this game. We could easily close the gap if more people played. You can start from the very beginning.
I'm so pumped. She is killing it with these newspaper endorsements. LFG
The potential bump from DMR might be much higher than the +3% figure circulating.  There's a 2016 piece that 538 published that is going around, including in this thread, that [lays out the case for the 3ish point bump from the DMR endorsement](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/des-moines-register-endorses-clinton-rubio-primary-iowa/).  It's worth a read because that it's a pretty broad simplification -- there's quite a bit of variance.  First, as an update to that post, Hillary was flat in support from date of endorsement (49.2%) to the final vote (49.8%).  Marco Rubio was polling at about 10.8% on the date of endorsement, and pulled in 23.1% of the vote(!) (Note: he also beat his polling average at the time of the caucuses, 17ish%, by 6ish%).  The 2016 results back a trend that isn't really outlined in the article: the only two candidates to underperform after a DMR endorsement were two high polling candidates (Dole '96, GWB '00).  Same goes for the flattish candidates (Dole '00, Hillary '08, Hillary '16).  What about the 20ish% and below candidates?  1. Simon '88: +5.4% 2. Edwards '04 +19.6% 3. McCain '08 +6.8% 4. Romney '12 +4.3% 5. Rubio '16 +12.3%  I don't think there is an obvious empirical case for X amount of jump, but the granular data is much more favorable to Warren's situation than the 3% figure.  LFG.
Des Moines Register out here making great decisions
You know, for not having the name recognition and/or built in fan base prior to running...she sure has done well for herself in a crowded field. Happy to see her shining after years of following her advocacy work.
Here's me breathing a *huge* sigh of relief. Here's to a great next ten days hunkering down and GOTC work.
YES!!   Among the people I know and get the privilege of talking politics with, the people who understand the most about the government and how it supports a diverse population of needs* tend to support Liz.  Because she understands, seeks to understand, and meets people with humility to facilitate better understanding.   I don't know why that's hard for other candidates. If they did, gosh, I'd be about them too. But apparently this quality in her is rare and valuable, and that she can expand that into her entire machine is indicative of her influence and ability as head of the entire Executive Branch.   To that, I say LFG.  LFG LFG LFG LFG LFG
Incredible! Just when she needed it!
INJECT THIS SHIT STRAIGHT INTO MY FUCKING VEINS HOLY FUCKKKKKKKK  Erm... I mean, HOLY FUCKKKKKKKKKK
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES  GAME ON BOYFRIEND
Very good news.  Someone at an Iowa blog thought she was likely to close really well in Iowa.   [https://www.bleedingheartland.com/2020/01/24/10-days-left-will-someone-break-out/](https://www.bleedingheartland.com/2020/01/24/10-days-left-will-someone-break-out/)
This is fantastic! I hope she can gain momentum from this.
Fuck yeah.
This is abso-fucking-lutely amazing news! LFG!!!!
The chance to keep dreaming big and fighting for change continues!   Hopefully this will give us the boost we need to win Iowa and then the nomination
Congrats guys
Just donated! Do your part to circulate this article and maximize the impact of this endorsement.
Oh my! This is so wonderful!!!!
So pumped guys. Things haven't been looking to good in iowa polls recently but this is fantastic news.  Especially for an electorate that is still largely undecided!  LFG!!!
HO-LY SHIT!!! Yeaaaaaaaaargh!
üòÅüòÅüòÅüî•üî•üî•üî•
I just heard that! Fantastic news!!
Ah! We needed this so badly.
\*internal fan girl screaming\*
But here I was getting told by Sanders Supporters to quit and not split the progressive vote! Guess they should stick to their own campaign!
Because I‚Äôm sure people are wondering...  1988 Endorsement: Paul Simon 1988 Caucus Winner: Dick Gephardt 1988 Democratic Nominee: Michael Dukakis  1992 No Endorsement (Iowa‚Äôs Senator tan for POTUS so everyone basically skipped campaigning for the caucus)  2000 Endorsement: Bill Bradley 2000 Caucus Winner: Al Gore 2000 Democratic Nominee: Al Gore  2004 Endorsement: John Edwards 2004 Caucus Winner: John Kerry 2004 Democratic Nominee: John Kerry  2008 Endorsement: Hillary Clinton 2008 Caucus Winner: Barack Obama 2008 Democratic Nominee: Barack Obama  2016 Endorsement: Hillary Clinton 2016 Caucus Winner: Hillary Clinton 2016 Democratic Nominee: Hillary Clinton  2020 Endorsement: Elizabeth Warren
Trolls in 3...2...1..  But in all seriousness, I‚Äôm glad she got the endorsement
This is huge.
This is good news. Folks saying that news endorsements aren't really important (not  the right word I'm looking for but it's 8AM here and I've not had a full cup of coffee yet, so forgive me), have a point.   However, it's another positive on the pile. I'm hoping some people in IA will see this and at least read the article. If they haven't decided yet, they may give Warren another look. Whether that translates into votes is anyone's guess. But this is a crowded field, so anything that pushes Warren to the head of the line, even if only briefly, is all to the good, IMHO.
w00t
Certain elements over in r\/politics have been mass downvoting this news. I had to switch to "controversial" to find any posts.
Thank goodness, I was worried it would go to someone else
The bad news: they have a bad record at endorsing the eventual caucus winner on the Democratic side: https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/endorsement/2016/01/22/history-register-caucus-endorsements/79158560/  The good news: past performance has no effect on future performance and we can turn their record around if we work hard
Most people are cool. They'll just tell you who they're voting for. If it's someone else, you thank them hangup and move on to the next one.   It's really not that bad. It's best if you do it with a group of people. Especially if you're wary.   Do what needs to be done.
Congrats to Liz and you all of you here!     while I have a different first choice, I think Liz would lead us to many great changes in our country!
Awesome, congrats y'all! She's my personal #2 but I think she's definitely deserving of this
Warren is my second choice, but I'm happy for all of you and your campaign.  Congratulations, you guys!

Just signed up for another phone bank this week. Who will match me?
Absolutely agree. Sent a lot of texts this weekend and it feels great to contribute! Was able to chat with several undecided voters that have Warren on their short list. For anyone who‚Äôs been on the fence about volunteering, now‚Äôs the time to jump in....it‚Äôs easy and you can do it on your own schedule.
My dream line up has Warren and Amy performing better than Sanders in Iowa.
Just to air things out a bit better, Gannett Co., Inc.(Des Moines Register owner) has more guts than The New York Times Company (CEO Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.)

Totally disagree with your assessment of the painting. I think it's iconic and Presidential. Well said otherwise!
What‚Äôs LFG?
It's really fun! I'm already at Jan 15!
She‚Äôs got the well-informed vote it seems.
Yes I agree the jump can be larger than 3%.  Bit I am also trying to keep my expectations in check.... that said... lfg!!!   My personal guess based on nothing is it can be as high as 10 pt jump but I am just a couch potato
Whenever I see John Edwards name I think... man that guy could have been President and then I shudder.
GOTC volunteer at your service !! üí™

>Incredible! Just when she needed it!  Well, if you want to feel better, on Preet Bharara's podcast, he interviewed top Iowa pollster Ann Selzer (it was episode #124 Born to Poll), and she said that basically the way to win Iowa was not to peak too fast, but instead slowly build.   That seems to be what Warren is doing ‚Äî Selzer said that Warren had one of the largest bases (1st and 2nd choice), while Sander's was the most narrow. When you add this endorsement from the Des Moines Register, it seems like that's what Warren is doing.

The endorsement is nothing but good news for Warren. It's not like candidates are out there saying, "Whoa, I hope I don't get the endorsement from the Des Moines Register because the person they endorse doesn't always win!"  I wonder if one of the things hurting Warren among voters is the impression that she's too radical (because she's being lumped in with another truly radical candidate). This type of endorsement helps show how mainstream she is.
It's important to keep in mind that the endorsement is better for persuading undecided caucus-goers... and there are a lot of them this time.  Not saying this will get Warren the nomination obviously, but I think we're also in more different times.
Their endorsements have translated into nominees more frequently in the GOP if memory serves
Is there one of these for the NYT?
TIL there was a senator named Paul Simon.
Can anyone guess how much this will affect/improve poll numbers for Warren? I‚Äôm so nervous because she‚Äôs been slipping in the polls regardless of the NYT endorsement üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞
In almost every instance they endorsed a better candidate than the nominee ultimately was (except for Obama). Doesn‚Äôt bode well :(
[removed]
There are so many trolls in the politics sub cant even get this story to the front page yet
Also the good news: Nate Silver claims that the endorsement adds about 3-4 points to the polling average in terms of ultimate caucus standing!
> The good news: past performance has no effect on future performance and we can turn their record around if we work hard  And it's not a reach to say this election and the previous are very atypical / unpredictable...
Same and glad it's not Biden.
Rule 4, let's just take the win.
It‚Äôs actually pretty big. Especially considering how close the race is in IA. My first guess is that it‚Äôll bring some college educated whites from Pete and back to her.
[deleted]
The number of undecided voters in Iowa is higher than usual at this point in the race so this endorsement could end up mattering quite a bit.
People who really like her and want/wanted to caucus for her but are worried about electability.
So many are still undecided in Iowa right now so yes it does matter.
Undecideds and some of the other candidates that have no chance at hitting the threshold.
Your concern is not entirely unwarranted.  That said, 40% of Iowa voters said they could still change their mind on who they support.

Awesome. Worth millions in advertising dollars.   Just want to add I got my Warren tshirt in the mail today and am so happy!
That is one of the things I love most about her. She owns it.
Oh man! That was very well done!   Is it real? (Sorry, I have not figured out twitter yet.)
Straight fire.
On point!  Was listening to Bros Save Democracy and they talked about how Warren has crazy charisma in person. Reading this tweet I can feel it.

I want a president who doesn't tweet at all.  Or a president who reigns in Twitter's white supremist owner.  I'm truly sorry that the Dem candidates feel they have to use that trollbot wasteland to seem relevant.
If we can elect Warren as POTUS, keep the House and flip the Senate, many treasonous criminals will be brought to justice.

MSNBC is bad, but nowhere near the same level as Fox. That link you posted has Fox significantly lower than everything else. CNN and NBC are about the same as "no news." In other words, people watching Fox are more ignorant than the general population, people watching CNN and NBC are at about the same.  Not supporting NBC at all, it's just a false equivalency to claim they are the same level.
Any TV news is garbage.
CNBC is an unabashed Wall Street Circlejerk. If acting like bootlickers is some sort of charade for them, its something they've done without ever breaking character since the early 90s

I‚Äôm not saying that they‚Äôre the same level, I‚Äôm suggesting that they are in the same league. When two ‚Äúnews‚Äù stations are leaving their viewers less informed than baseline ignorance, then the scale of disinformation is less important than the fact that both sources are nonsense.

I have social media friends who get called bots in the course of their shitposting.     So I think they're might be a degree of Poe's law and 'eyeballing it' seems faulty to me.
yes. I've seen some for reddit and twitter.
 I'm sure the authors of the ACA didn't like it being called Obamacare, either. But I do think it was the right move politically at the time unless they named it like Dodd-Frank.  All I can think of is M4A has a better ring to it than the Affordable Care Act, so maybe it will be easier to defend the original title.     But yeah, I don't want a fight with Bernie's people. That wasn't my intention.
And they shouldn't.  I'm a huge Warren fan, but Bernie has been trying to work on M4A for how long?  He brought it up, he made it mainstream, he just isn't the candidate to make the dream a reality.  If it gets named after someone, it should be him.  &#x200B;  Credit where it's due, folks.
There's zero difference in my eyes between a bot, a troll, and a shitposter.
If Medicare for All becomes a thing we'll probably just call it Medicare.
An early proponent of the ACA was Mitt Romney and he was happy with the name.
The bill Elizabeth supports was written by Bernie and his staff, yeah?
Romneycare didn't seem to stick nationally. That's  just the nature of political taunting.
Well that simplifies things.
Yes, she cosponsored his bill.   ~~Though she just hinted in an interview that we should expect M4A to take 10 years instead of four. That language differs from Bernie's bill a little, so I assume she will be releasing her own plan eventually.~~
Romneycare was just one state, though.
Which interview was this?  Are you sure you're not getting it confused with Kamala Harris's 10 year plan?
Started under him though regardless.
You're right, she's apparently misquoted. My bad!
Right, but that's why the name didn't catch on, one state
Elizabeth Warren Just Told Private Prisons to Release Their Coronavirus Plans
That's our Warren, almost always leading the pack with this type of thing. And she's still doing it after having dropped out.
Uhh she‚Äôs so smart why couldn‚Äôt she still be in the race? Every new blurb I hear about her, just reminds me of how good a president she would‚Äôve been.
I‚Äôm not sure how true it is but I heard she was doing the same thing with the big banks. I work for one and they released their plans today. We overheard one of the higher ups telling another that she called the CEO.
I‚Äôm glad someone‚Äôs saying it. I liked the moment today when the media confronted the Trump people at the press conference: ‚ÄúHow are you going to pay for it?‚Äù... ‚Äúabrupt silence‚Äù.
But I thought she was betraying all her principles and was in fact a corporate shill who wanted poor people to die because she hasn‚Äôt bent the knee to Bernie Sanders yet?
Has the government done that?
2024...?
Yet another example of Warren's awesome intersectionality.  She's always looking out for the most vulnerable in our society and how each issue  will impact them.    So glad she's not dead, she's just in the senate. :)
She‚Äôs my President
Well, she‚Äôs a senator so it really has nothing to do with her presidential campaign.
Kinda funny how media says shit like this *after* she drops out
[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/elizabeth-warren-asks-big-banks-for-plans-on-coronavirus-response.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/elizabeth-warren-asks-big-banks-for-plans-on-coronavirus-response.html)  Nice to hear how something I read about in the press is playing out on the ground (in the banks!)  It's heartening to see how active and activated Warren is. Even without the presidency, she puts in all the work to push this country in a better, more functional direction. She's going to continue to do great things. We have to help rally public support for her righteous fights, for our fights.
That's super cool to hear, thanks for sharing!

A woman is only great after she drops out (and greater still if she bends knee to St. Bernard and his misogynistic campers).
She's only great if she serves Bernie. Serving America is a sign that she's a neoliberal snake.

Yes.  Step 1: Mike Pence will lead them in prayer.  Step 2: Trump will blame... Obama?  Step 3: ???  Step 4: Everyone died.
She will only truly have left this ~~school~~ race when none here are loyal to her.
She is clearly vying for the VP spot under Biden.
Sure, she's not a threat to the status quo now.
I joked the other day. Mike Pence: "Pray the corona away?".
EXACTLY. If the media had talked about her this way from November-February, she'd be the frontrunner right now.      But no, they gave in to their billionaire/wall street/corporate overlords, put their big fat thumb on the scale and pushed for Biden. Preached their message of fear and mediocrity and electability and led John & Jane voter right down the middle of the road, into Grandpa Joe's donkey cart. "Hop in, buddy! Let's go back to 2006 and make America tepid again!"     But now they're all "Oh she was such a great candidate, so sad, what happened?"
Warren raises $14,000,000 before Nevada caucus
Amazing! A week ago I thought $7 million was an outlandish goal.
GREAT WORK EVERYONE!  But obviously, you have to hand it to E-Dubs and that crowd pleasing, debate thrashing, performance.
Keep kicking the shit out of billionaires on stage and watch the money roll in!
Double her goal. Media gonna ignore that? Funny to watch them try.

I‚Äôve recently joined and I just convinced 10 of my family members to not only vote for Warren but also for each of them to donate $100 to Warren. Let‚Äôs go big and shoot for higher!!!

Good for her, hope she raises much more.
The last debate was amazing for warren and sanders and seeing it reflected in donation surges!
Also the persist PAC is a progressive PAC that Emily's List donates to. So yes its a super PAC, but it's also the only way progressive organizations can make large contributions to a candidate. That is why Bernie made the Our Revolution super PAC (which isn't allowed to campaign on behalf of Bernie due to campaign finance laws but is anyway)
Does anyone know what are Pete's numbers? I heard/read somewhere that after the Iowa "win" he expected to get 20 million, but got only 3.

Absolutely, and I hope everyone in the Warren campaign wakes up from this huge donation haul and realizes that this, *this* is the Warren that will win the Democratic nomination and then Presidency. Warren needs to lean into her strength: wicked smart attacks and a righteous fury on behalf of the voters. Bring it Warren!  tl;dr You don't fuck with the Warren, man.
> But obviously, you have to hand it to E-Dubs and that crowd pleasing, debate thrashing, performance.  Getting billionaires squeezed by the balls is very popular with the masses. Who would have known!
I mean who can‚Äôt give $15? It was better than any movie for the same price.
Holy moly, you're a superstar!
Yes, the best outcome for Warren would be if Buttigieg, Kloubachar, and Biden have a really bad day and she ends up as the last middle choice between Sanders and Bloomberg (who has unlimited funds for his fantasy of buying his way through a brokered convention).
Was it amazing for Sanders? Seemed like his hardest hit was pushing back on Bloomberg calling him a communist and that was more of a group effort.
It is so refreshing to see strong progressive voices like theirs really resonating with the voters
She was the only candidate trying to run without it until now.
PACs are not superpacs, they're 2 different things
None of it is from Super PACs because that's not the way they work. I'm not sure how many are from billionaires or millionaires but they could only donate $2800, so the vast majority of the haul is from everyday people.
Bless your heart! Warren is still rejecting donations from the wealthy, and if you knew at all what you were talking about you‚Äôd know it‚Äôs illegal for a Super PAC to coordinate directly with a campaign, and that includes donating funds to a campaign.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a shoe horn somewhere to help get your foot out of your mouth. Have a pleasant day!!
For the last time, Super PACs cannot donate to campaigns. There is a difference between independent Super PAC spending and direct campaign donations. Her fundraising does not include anything from the Persist PAC. A PAC as an organization contributing to a campaign directly is illegal. Warren has literally nothing to do with the PAC, it‚Äôs a private organization. Just like Bernie and Biden have nothing to do with the money groups supporting their campaigns. Unlike Pete Buttigeg.    [here is an article from ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/super-pac-short-history/story?id=16960267) explaining the history of Super PACs. The internet is an amazing resource if you use it responsibly :)   [14mil in 10 days from grassroots supporters.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/484214-warren-says-she-raised-14-million-in-10-days?amp)  Over 5 million on debate day. And per the town hall, she specifically said 9 million in three days, since the debate alone (250,000 donors, avg contribution $25). Perhaps you should watch it again and pay close attention!! [Here is a link if you need it. start around 9:20.](https://youtu.be/axKCxDlPlSQ)   Warren is amazing!! LFG.
Super PACs are legally prohibited from contributing to candidates' campaigns, so that is a no.
She had a massive debate performance. Why are people so intent on saying money bought XYZ when the fact of the matter is her debate performance is causing a surge?  My lord. Warren was significantly high in upvotes before Bernie started gaining momentum in 2019 and his team and/or Russia crucified her for her M4A plan.
Super PACs can‚Äôt donate directly to campaigns... that‚Äôs illegal.  So nope!! All grass roots donors.
Removed: Rule 7.     There is no evidence these donations are anything different than what they have been quarter after quarter for the past year.
It‚Äôs not a quarterly report.
Well mine was $30. Maybe you can figure out the average from that.
Isn‚Äôt she connected to a Super PAC now?

I mean, I would certainly prefer that Bloomberg learns the hard way that he *can't* buy his way to the White House, any of the other centrists would be a better option than "1% less offensive than Trump."

I agree. I thought Elizabeth had an amazing night and Bernie had kind of a rough one.

Gotcha! I wasn‚Äôt aware, thanks!
Note, this sub had HUGE donation upsurge that correlates exactly with what Warren received. We have had several Matching threads (we had to put them in queue because we had more than one at a time!)  I think other candidates don't seem to understand that we really are in it for the long haul.
I only did $10 this time because I did $25 last week.
Mine was $5 and I‚Äôm on Food Stamps right now so....
No any moreso than Bernie's Nurse's Union Super PAC. Actually, perhaps less so, since the new Warren PAC only started this week and the "connection" is just that she hasn't publicly decried them.
OMG I need to write a parody now
> Im a progressive but Amy is my second.  How so? Why would you as a progressive, vote for a candidate who does not espouse progressive policies?
[removed]
He maintains that Our Revolution is not a super PAC, despite the fact that it operates exactly like one, to his benefit. It's an unusual level of dissembling for him.
Our Revolution is a 501(c)(4) otherwise known as a Dark Money group. It can accept unlimited contributions from any source and is not required to publicly disclose donors (unlike Super PACs which are required to disclose names) making them less transparent than Super PACS. https://campaignlegal.org/update/pacs-super-pacs-dark-money-groups-whats-difference   Our Revolution took in $1 million from anonymous donors who gave more than the limits, most of it six-figure sums. This data is from tax filings up till 2018. (2019 isn't publically revealed yet and won't have to be until after the presidential election. https://apnews.com/345bbd1af529cfb1e41305fa3ab1e604
Yeah because accusing someone of only being able to raise money because of a PAC is so nice. Really upsetting knowing Bernie isn‚Äôt the only one with over a million grass roots donors, isn‚Äôt it? Almost as if all the posts you‚Äôve been reading of Warren being an establishment democrat are wrong (they are).
I'm confused. Did you post this reply 3 days later? Someone else has responded to you with the answer.
There are also [tight limits on campaign contribution](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/). Individuals can only donate a total of $2800 to a presidential candidate per election.
I could only do $2 this time
I donated $5 before the Nevada debate and then $25 after the debate :)
Thank you!
Oh! Okay. Thanks for the clarification. I wanted to be informed and armed with knowledge when confronted by the undecideds or anti-Warrens.
Are candidates allowed to publicly decry them or is that coordination.
Except National Nurses United is a Super PAC of a nurses' union, and Persist PAC is a new PAC that wont disclose its donors until April, well after Super Tuesday
This isn't true at all, while the nurses union doesn't need to disclose donors, its fairly unlikely that a billionaire is going to donate to them. We also all know what the union is and what they stand for.   The persist superpac is exactly the kind of superpac and dark money liz has rightfully called out most of this election and her political career. These pacs solely are created to skirt around campaign finance laws and act as direct financial support to campaigns. They are not tied in to any existing democratic institution like a union or movement based org (sunrise etc).

Because Bernie has gotten little done in his decades in politics. He is a career politician. I want someone who knows how to create a consensus so stuff actually gets done. Sanders will not be able to get anything done. Warren has. Klobuchar as a Democrat will get plenty done and reverse the damage created by trump. I‚Äôm also concerned about voting in another cult leader. We have spent the last 4 years with a guy who has supporters who call the media fake, do not hold him accountable for anything, everything questioning him is a conspiracy and does it by having an aggressive mob harassing anyone who disagrees. I don‚Äôt want to be part of voting in another.
Removed. Keep it civil, report the comment and move on, please.
Yeah but donations to super PACs are unlimited
No one knows. The FEC and IRS has been so weak since Citizens United that pretty much the only thing you can't get away with is straw donations and foreign-source donations.
True, but I‚Äôll also throw Our Revolution into all of this as it doesn‚Äôt have to disclose any of its donors.
[removed]
Yea it's more like Our Revolution which Bernie himself started and is actively violating campaign finance laws with it.... So if anyone attacks Warren on super PACs they should look at their candidate first. Our revolution won't have to disclose donors until after the election, it's dark money something Bernie was against until he lost in 2016 and changed his mind.
> The persist superpac is exactly the kind of superpac and dark money liz has rightfully called out most of this election and her political career.  That's not true in the slightest and it's both in bad faith and reckless for you to suggest it is.
Removed: Trolling.
Wow! This rude comment totally makes me want to vote for someone else!      Thanks!

There is no evidence her raising money has been anything but the exact same  as it has been for the last 5 or sow FCC filings. Implying otherwise, with zero evidence, is a bad faith attack.  This sub had the exact same giant boost that Warren saw at the exact same time. We had to put matching threads in a queue because we had too many going on at once and decided to finish one before announcing the next.     If you continue to spread baseless accusations, with zero evidence, you will be banned.
What is bad faith or reckless?  Persist PAC exists so that wealthy supporters of Liz can help her campaign with their finances because they can't contribute past the individual contribution limit. This is the definition of a super pac that Liz has talked about in the past. It was formed to make 7 figure media buys and we don't know yet who is giving to it and how much.  You don't see a difference between that and a political arm of a union or existing mission based org?
Our Revolution PAC is not the same as Our Revolution. The former is a PAC, the latter is a 501c(4) organization.
Ah, yes, notable shadowy billionaires Denise Feriozzi, Kristine Kippins, Karin Johanson, and Kim Rogers.  None of what you're implying reflects reality and is solely meant to shape a narrative. That's why it's in bad faith.
Elizabeth Warren was sounding the alarm on student debt back in 2008
She is the only candidate thus far that I agree with every time she speaks.
If you liked this video [donate](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/redditforwarren) or [sign up to volunteer](https://elizabethwarren.com/join-us).
She has been going on a out student loan debt and credit card debt for years and is completely right.
Maxed Out came out in 2005. She was sounding the alarm earlier than that.
This is a winning policy. It's funny that Bernie tried to swipe her idea for headlines in the run-up to the debate and he got no traction off it. With his obsession to be all things more progressive than everyone else he just doesn't seem credible anymore.
I am a former Bernie main, we need to roll out/share as much of this kind of film as we can. She's been in the trenches just like him, and shes been getting shit done.
I have the most confidence in her to actually address issues in a way that will be hard for "politics as usual" to stay in place.  I actually feel optimistic about a future with Elizabeth Warren as the President.
there are others i agree with too, but she seems the most serious
Mayor pete?
What do you disagree with Bernie on?
Yeah sorry, but Bernie's been taking about cancelling student debt for years. Just because he got his plan out later than Warren doesn't mean he stole it for headlines.
Bernie has been talking about this for years too. We don't need to attack the only other left wing candidate in the race! Both Bernie and Warren are good.
Read my comment to another poster in this thread about my concern regarding Bernie. He‚Äôs a nice man and I think he has our best interest at heart, but what he advocates for is a dead end.   I want to see a Warren/Buttigieg ticket. He is unelectable due to inexperience, but if he works as VP and plays an active role they could dominate the political landscape for a long time at the most critical juncture our country has ever faced.
Somebody needs to edit down The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class into a more digestible video. An hour is a tough sell for most.
I honestly haven‚Äôt paid much attention to him yet. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs electable because he‚Äôs gay. That sucks, but there are enough people who think that way.
He is a straight up socialist. He doesn‚Äôt call himself one now, but he did in the past and even as of his last campaign I heard him say it was his ultimate goal.   I also don‚Äôt appreciate the fact that he never called himself a Democrat until he was running for president and then ended up sabotaging Hillary‚Äôs campaign because the party wouldn‚Äôt bend over backward for him. Why should they? He‚Äôs extreme and only wanted to take advantage of their infrastructure he did nothing to create. As soon as he lost he dropped them again. Now that he‚Äôs running again he‚Äôs calling himself a Democrat. He‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs a socialist.   I‚Äôm ok with social programs when industry either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt solve critical problems. That isn‚Äôt what he wants. At one point in his campaign last time I actually laughed out loud when he said the problem with the inner city is that the kids don‚Äôt have enough entertainment. Come on. Food is a right. Housing is a right. Water is a right. Education is a right. Entertainment is a right. Ummmm no.   I‚Äôm in Prague right now and read a very interesting article about the dangers of socialism, which I‚Äôm fully aware of anyway. It was an article about tipping, but they hammered home the point. It takes away the drive to succeed because there is no reward in working harder. When the USSR collapsed and the Czech Republic became free of socialism everything immediately improved in all aspects. It is now arguably the most glorious city in the world.   That isn‚Äôt the only thing about socialism that we need to fear. Imagine the inevitable Donald Trump that controls both government and industry. It wouldn‚Äôt take long, either. Neither party generally holds power more than 8 years.  I was at the White House protesting for two weeks. One day I arrived and a different group was there protesting fascism. I didn‚Äôt recognize them, but I set up by them. They were playing kind of headbanger music and looked a bit scary, but an enemy of my enemy, etc. Then one of the members stood up with a mic while another passed out pamphlets. First she talked about the evils of capitalism and how socialism is the answer. She spoke about the strong leader their group has and how he can lead us away from the cliff. It didn‚Äôt take 2 minutes before she was saying what we really need is a COMMUNIST REVOLUTION, which she then repeatedly yelled into the crowd. I‚Äôm out.   What we need is someone with a financial background and a keen understanding of law who knows the difference between social programs and socialism. For me that is Elizabeth Warren.
Talking about it isn't the same as having a plan. He literally announced it just a few days before Liz Warren's debate.   Sure he stole it for the headlines. No harm in that. I just found it funny that he didn't get any traction off it.
But Warren's is based on family income and doesn't let the already wealthy get free education at their wealthy people schools.
How is this an attack on Bernie? In fact, I more often hear Bernie supporters criticizing Warren by saying she's just copying his agenda. This is just to show how Warren has been talking about this issue in an Elizabeth Warren subreddit where we, you know, share Warren related news and clips.
Agree.
Bernie spends way too much time with his base and does not seem to understand they will never make up a majority of the electorate. There‚Äôs no effort to reach out there, everyone is supposed to come to them. It‚Äôs telling that on the week of the debate he did an AMA on S4P and then looked unprepared at the debate. His priorities are what they are, and they won‚Äôt get him across the finish line. I wrote him about this two years ago and they didn‚Äôt even send back a form letter. The base is all that matters no matter how small it gets. His heart may be in the right place but his strategy is straight up disappointing and some of the people on his campaign team are straight up assholes, even though I generally agree with their political views.
Consider watching him speak. He is extremely good at articulating his points. Plus, in a pew research poll, 13% of americans said that they "wouldn't vote for an otherwise qualified gay man". 17% of americans said they wouldnt vote for a woman. I dont believe either is accurate in the face of trump, and besides, a voter can forget about the sexuality of a candidate easier than other attributes.
Socialism is when the workers own the means of production. Why would a worker not have an incentive to work under socialism if they, as a partial owner, get a cut of the profits? Wouldn‚Äôt they have less incentive to work hard under a capitalist system, where all of the profits go to one person, the owner?
That does sound better! It's good to be choosing between excellent candidates like Warren and Sanders, no single person will have all the answers or be able to change everything. Let's all hope Kamala, Biden, etc fall off hard.
As someone who was disowned by her family and had to drop out of college at 21, right before graduation because I couldn‚Äôt get my parents‚Äô tax forms: A student should be allowed to be seen as a separate person. Basing my ability to get financial aid on my parents (who were poor but didn‚Äôt love me anymore) pushed back my graduation by 20 years.
Universal should be universal. As long as you separate them the wealthy will always benefit.
I suppose that‚Äôs true. And the same ones who wouldn‚Äôt vote for him because he‚Äôs gay wouldn‚Äôt vote for a Democrat anyway. I can‚Äôt believe 17% said they wouldn‚Äôt vote for a woman. What the hell is wrong with people?
That‚Äôs the theory, but historically it doesn‚Äôt work out that way in the long run. The top brass get everything and labor gets nothing. Supporters like to point to Sweden and Denmark as examples of socialism as a success story, but they really aren‚Äôt. They are very business friendly, but have a big social safety net. The best working example of socialism currently is China and it‚Äôs not very good for most Chinese people and it remains to be seen if they can continue, and even with China what brought about its rise was the lessening of socialism and opening the doors of capitalism. Most socialist countries end up totally corrupt because of the reasons I stated before.   Capitalism is far from perfect, but you can always go out and start your own business or work for another employer. Under socialism that isn‚Äôt an option. If you hate your employer, tough luck.
I will push back- black americans, specifically older black americans, are often quite religious and sometimes homophobic but still vote democrat.
Okay, now you‚Äôre just making stuff up
What do you mean? I was trying to be as factual as possible without introducing opinion. What follows is absolutely my opinion.   The biggest problem America faces is how we tax our wealthy and how we have let labor unions get demonized. We have created a scenario where we have working poor who need government assistance for basic needs because we don‚Äôt allow for a decent living wage. While the rich pay more of the taxes the percentage of their income that gets taxed is far less, and they have far more money than they need. We should be giving tax relief to the lower classes and far higher taxes to the wealthy.   I say that as a fairly wealthy person. I retired when I was 48 and essentially live a playboy life. I‚Äôm on vacation for a month now and it‚Äôs my second one this year. It astounded me every year when I passed the threshold where I made so much I didn‚Äôt have to pay into Social Security for the rest of the year, so I got even more take home pay. I always thought I should have to pay more at that point. Why should the poor have to pay a higher percentage of their income to help the needy? My spouse also makes a great income and will retire in a year and half at age 57. We have a house in the country in a resort area and another in the city we rent out for extra income. That‚Äôs absurd, but capitalism isn‚Äôt gave us that. Primarily it was the fact that we both worked really hard at our careers and we renovated a couple of houses and made a lot of money on the market crash because we both know history and could see the writing on the wall.   Meanwhile most of the generation that follows us justifiably feel they will never retire. Why? Because they have far less spending money than mine did. The tax rate may have dropped, but the cost of living is absurd now. Fortunately for them they will inherit our wealth, but most people aren‚Äôt that fortunate. The system is absolutely designed by Republicans to help people like us and we are both strong Democrats. Socialism wouldn‚Äôt solve that problem. It makes it dramatically worse because you end up paying even more of your income to support the wealthy and the way to the top isn‚Äôt by working hard it‚Äôs by bribery and the good old boys club.   I‚Äôm currently in Prague. Under Soviet rule this city was dismal. After the collapse of the USSR they opened the door to capitalism wide and it is now a screaming success. Not without problems, but in far, far better shape than they were.   Both systems are flawed, but at least the system right now can be changed if young people would just get out and vote. Once socialism takes root it never goes away until it collapses under its own weight.  To be clear, I‚Äôm talking about pure socialism, not social programs. I‚Äôm a firm believer in 100% nationalized healthcare with doctors getting free education and very good salaries. I‚Äôm farther left on that than most people. Fuck Medicare for all. It should all be covered. Glasses, teeth, cancer, elder care. I‚Äôm on the fence with free education, but mostly because Jeb Bush had a good idea (his only one) that we should open the doors to the world via the Internet and let he free market take over, and I think we should set the student loan rate to the same rate banks get rather than letting them set the rate, and even if it were free it would come with major strings attacked like public universities not having sports teams and requiring new textbooks for things that never change so students could resell them like I did.   Social programs, fine as long as they are limited. Socialism with a capital S? No.
>I‚Äôm a firm believer in 100% nationalized healthcare with doctors getting free education and very good salaries. I‚Äôm farther left on that than most people. Fuck Medicare for all. It should all be covered. Glasses, teeth, cancer, elder care.  I‚Äôm sorry, I have no idea what you‚Äôre trying to say here. Are you saying you side more with Bernie here than with warren? Since Bernie wants nationalized healthcare and Elizabeth doesn‚Äôt?   Look, I‚Äôve had this conversation with people on and off of reddit basically every other day for the past year. I never seem to get anywhere, so I‚Äôm just gonna say that the billionaires who control every aspect of our lives have a vested interest in convincing us that the economic system that would get rid of their wealth wouldn‚Äôt actually work. Be very careful about disinformation and fearmongering.
I don‚Äôt agree with single payer because it‚Äôs basically a flat tax which helps people like me who don‚Äôt need it, but it is the next step toward what I want. I worked at the DNC for 5 years in the 90s. It was really interesting. One of the things I learned is that you need a measured approach to most things to get anywhere. Conservatism is simple. Convince people that change is bad. Liberalism is a much harder sell to people my age because it‚Äôs true, we got ours and we don‚Äôt want to risk it. I say ‚Äúwe‚Äù not specifically meaning me because I will be fine regardless. Her *approach* is what I appreciate.
> Bernie wants nationalized healthcare and Elizabeth doesn‚Äôt?   Elizabeth Warren raised her hand to say she does not want a private market. She has repeatedly stated in interviews that she does not want a private market. Why continue to peddle this lie? Maybe you could learn something from Elizabeth‚Äôs approach to changing peoples minds on an issue you care about, instead of demonizing her for doing what Bernie supporters weren‚Äôt able to accomplish with this individual.
So you don‚Äôt want national healthcare?
Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris Looked Like Winners At The First Debates: Poll
Backing you, Elizabeth! No Wall Street influence is the way to enter office.
Honestly as much as I love Castro, I'm starting to come around to the idea of a Warren/Harris ticket. I know progressives have gripes with Harris, myself included, but no candidate has a perfect record and having two women in contrast with Trump/Pence would be a perfect representation of the Democratic Party today.
If it comes down to Warren vs Harris, we all win.
Warren is still my first choice, but I have a feeling that Harris will continue to be very effective in the debates, and would probably be more effective against trump in a debate.
I have no interest in voting for anyone who isn't Warren or Bernie, but I do think Kamala did great. My hope is that Warren and Bernie can just chill for a bit while everyone else attacks each other lmao
I didn't think Warren was that clear cut of a winner. I thought she was more playing defense. Stay in her comfort zone. She is trending well and doesn't need a big gotcha moment. Bernie was the same way.  I really think Kamala was going for the gotcha moments but lacked substance. Castro was the surprise for me when he really went after Beto for not supporting all immigrants. I'm not saying he's anywhere near my favorite, but he had the most positive movement.
I really the both of them! Being that Kamala is a former prosecutor I feel she has more skills if she were debating Trump. But I like Warrens ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a plan for that‚Äù. Warren definitely has her campaign laid out üíØ
Would a Warren/Harris ticket be viable.
Please vote in the Daily Kos post debate straw poll:  https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2019/7/2/1868950/-Daily-Kos-Democratic-Presidential-Straw-Poll-post-first-debate-edition
I also came away very impressed with Pete Buttigieg (hope I spelt that correct).
Liz is the winner, Kamala is a nark.
Why do they constantly pick pictures of these two women screening and being angry. I wish whom ever would pick dignified pictures. These two women are amazing and not angry.
Real question though: how are we going to win with voter machine rigging, election interference from foreign powers , and the efficient propaganda machine of Trump?   I‚Äôm worried, y‚Äôall. We have some amazing candidates. It doesn‚Äôt mean shit if the deck is stacked against them.
Glad they both had good showings.  : )
They sure do have the face winners have...
While I‚Äôm hearing some ‚ÄúWarren is from Oklahoma,‚Äù she still gives off a coastal elite vibe and this really isn‚Äôt the demographic we are trying to capture. Castro was also very well-spoken at the debate and can really help more with the South, compared to Harris who seems like a redundant choice in capturing the coastal elite vote. Castro also has less baggage.
But also we shouldn‚Äôt attack any Democratic candidate! I‚Äôd be happy to support Kamala in the general election. Come together and beat Trump, even if it has some Wall Street influence.
A Warren/Buttigieg ticket would take some wind out of the ‚Äúcoastal elite‚Äù attacks that the Republican Party dishes out.  Edit: I would image a Warren/Harris or Warren/Booker ticker would be better suited for appealing to POCs though.
Warren/Booker ticket would be an interesting one.
I prefer Harris as AG. She would be an incredible AG.
>  I know progressives have gripes with Harris, myself included,  I have gripes with Sanders. I was disappointed that he didn‚Äôt seem to have time to prepare for the debate, but did have time to do an AMA for a certain subreddit of his that I consider to be home to a more toxic strand of his base.   What‚Äôs important is that we pick candidates the broader Democratic base can unite behind, not exactly what vocal activists on Reddit want. Ive spoke to a lot of people who are more moderate and what they like about Harris and Warren is they can explain their big proposals at length. Sanders feels like a dream, and that‚Äôs reflected in how some of his supporters act about his proposals. They also tend to have complaints about every politician who isn‚Äôt Sanders, and consider no criticism of Sanders as valid. It just isn‚Äôt the healthiest group to be catering to in the first place. A large amount of time is needed to deal with them, versus the amount of reliable votes you can actually get in return. That has been a long-standing problem with the American far left and it‚Äôs really too bad.
Warren/Castro would by my choice. Warren staying on point and calm while Castro attacks with sharp critiques without coming across as angry.
when was the last time a presidential candidate chose another candidate from the primaries as their running mate? just curious. i see this idea bounced around all the time but 1) it doesn't seem like this kind of thing ever happens and 2) it doesn't make sense to take two people with almost completely overlapping fanbases on one ticket and 3) wouldn't you rather have one of them in the senate instead of as VP?
You think Trump will keep Pence around?
Honestly, I‚Äôd be happy if any of the 20 (maybe minus two or three) became president instead of trump.
Every single candidate including Marianne Williamson would win a debate to Trump. After 2016 debates don‚Äôt really seem to matter
I've had Warren as my first, with Buttigieg and Sanders following. Harris shot up and I think may overtake Sanders' spot for me.
Harris would make him seem like an old, disconnected racist, but Warren would make him seem like a moron. Both have their merits.
I personally think Warren would be more effective against Trump at debates because she wouldn't take the bait and get pulled down to his level. I think Hillary spent too much time attacking Trump during the debates and I can see Harris doing the same thing.
My hope is that Warren pulls ahead and Sanders endorses her.
Luckily a lot of desperate people in the 1-2% range, otherwise the messaging seems to be "hold hands and sing kumbaya" while focusing on Trump the person rather than the broken system that lead to Trump.
I actually thought Bernie did worse than Warren...maybe all the craziness of Day 2, but he seemed off his game and dodgey on questions.
I agree with you. Warren didn't pull punches or really debate against anyone. But to go along with what you said, maybe she didn't have to! She had more questions directed straight to her, so she didn't have to fight for screen time.
I agree along the same line. I love warren and think she "won" but she won by not going too far out of her way.  Which is smart since it was night 1 was quickly forgotten after night 2, meaning she also didn't need to do much since most of the people on her night weren't serious competition. Why take the risk early on?
She prob did win night one but if she had debated like that on night 2 she would have gotten run over.  I'm not saying she's not capable of standing up when the lights shine brighter, but I hope she's a bit more outspoken in the next one.
Warren didn‚Äôt land any punches, but she didn‚Äôt need to. Everyone was busy going after Beto, and she looked like the smart adult above the fray when it was all over.
8 years Warren then Harris as prez.
Really? He dropped several spots in my view. His whole, ‚Äúpeople can buy into Medicare,‚Äù seems disingenuous.  Buying into a health care plan is called a premium; the reason Medicare for All is so important is because people can‚Äôt afford their premiums and deductibles; the purpose of Medicare is to provide services without premiums.  He was my #3 choice before the debate, but I‚Äôm not really considering him after that.
How is she a nark?
Let‚Äôs please not buy into bullshit right wing framing about ‚Äúcoastal elites‚Äù.
This sentiment is so scripted and stupid.
Attack,  or open discussion as long as no advances the insane notion any of them are as bad as Trump. We need open dialog. I would never be happy to vote for a candidate that allows more Wall Street influence. Reinstatement of Glass-Steagall is beginning to seem as taboo as cutting the military budget. But I am certainly voting for the Democratic candidate. Obviously even if the next Democrat to be president simply  kicks the can down the road then retires to huge speakers fees on Wall  Street it's at least better than Trump advancing closer to a  dictatorship.  But that's the sort of  thing that brought us Trump. It's obvious FOX and Republicans lie about  themselves while focusing on the least desirable dirt Democratic candidates  bring to the table. So the less dirt the democratic candidate has, the  fewer money ties the better. It needs to be the priority.
I still want Buttigieg to run for statewide office in Indiana. Challenging Governor Eric Holcomb might be too difficult given his popularity, but Senator Todd Young is up in 2022 and is more vulnerable.
I'd read Warren/Pete cover to cover.
Warren and Buttigieg appeal to the same voters, mostly high-information, upper middle class whites. It‚Äôs kind of a redundant ticket. However Warren also polls pretty well amongst black voters while Buttigieg is strongly disliked by black voters (he‚Äôs polling at 1%).   This week I‚Äôm feeling like the winning ticket is Warren/Booker.
Not really just because they are the same race doesn't make them more appealing to POC. Harris and Booker are behind Biden, Warren, and Sanders in S.C. Harris is problematic because of her upholding systemic racism as a D.A she upheld overly harsh sentencing plus allowed a prison to not allow a Sikh man to be hired since he wouldn't remove his turban.  Corey Booker is way to close to Wall Street and the banking sector that through predatory lending has targeted POC and redlined them from obtaining good quality housing. Castro, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, or Abrams are all much better VP candidates with less baggage.
The other thing about that is that Trump won in 2016 with the rust belt and having someone from middle America on the ticket would go a long way in swinging some of the rural working class voters
Yess I want Warren/Buttigieg!!
I would frame it as *representing* POCs. People of color want to be represented, and have a seat at the table. Not just an appeal, but the correct thing to do.
Double up on northeastern senators? ü§î
Considering she talks about hows she‚Äôs the best person to prosecute Trump, I think that‚Äôs the job she‚Äôs angling for
Truth. Her talents are wasted at VP.
I‚Äôd prefer someone with a much stronger record of supporting the disenfranchised than the powerful. Harris is dynamite, but only if she‚Äôs on your side.
If you're referring to WayOfTheBern, it was his press secretary (who obviously should know better) who did it.  Sanders did his in SandersForPresident, which has some toxic posters, but isn't entirely captured by them.  While I do think he or someone on his staff should be WAY more motivated in reigning in his supporters' toxicity, S4P isn't terrible and is the most legitimate friendly territory he could do it in.
> What‚Äôs important is that we pick candidates the broader Democratic base can unite behind, not exactly what vocal activists on Reddit want.  Actually what's important is we nominate the candidate who will enact policies that benefit people. For me that 1. Warren, 2. Sanders. Not sure who's a distant third choice yet.
I think Obama and Biden were both in the 2008 primaries. And I'm not sure if Harris and Warren have that much overlapping support; might help to know what the dominant second choice pick is for Harris or Warren supporters.
You dont think he will?
Good question. I have heard rumors, and we know how bad Trump's track record on cabinet member retention is, but I see no reason for Pence to leave yet.
I don‚Äôt think anyone of them could be worse than Trump.
Not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, but I find Marianne Williamson deeply unimpressive. Rhetorically, she'd be a lot better; less racist (as far as I know), less hateful, less eager to suck up to Kim Jong-Un and praise moral reprobates around the world, but in terms of being an effective leader in the global stage, I'd still be very worried
Nah Williamson would win because she has the power of love /s
Tbh Marianne would probably do great in a debate against Trump. In terms of how qualified they are or how well they genuinely understand how to enact their platform without just handing it off to someone else they're exactly the same.
To a reasonably intelligent person, yes. But the average voter will likely perceive the debates a little differently.
Problem with Harris for me is that she was a prosecutor, part of the problem she claims to champion. She‚Äôs also flipped flopped on progressive issues which doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. Admittedly she‚Äôs excellent debating which will come in handy in the next few debates. For me it‚Äôs Bernie/Warren at the first spot, then Yang and everyone else a distant third. And lastly Biden and that dude from Colorado, no thanks
Does either actually matter though? Hillary made him seen pole a racist moron and he still won.
Though I supported Bernie in 2016, and like him... I fear that even the mere fact that he is running right now is a testament to his ego.   The obvious coalition building progressive choice is Warren, yet Sanders runs? I fear he would take it to the end.
He didn‚Äôt do that very quickly in 2016 when he was mathematically out of the running. Don‚Äôt expect him to drop out of the race when he should.
He did seem kind of annoyed with a couple of the questions early on. But I think he killed it in his closing remarks.
I don't think so. He knew the road is long and that he'll still be standing months from now. There was no reason to score points.
I think that‚Äôs a correct approach, but I really hope she‚Äôs on the ‚Äúmain‚Äù stage in the second debate. I have all the faith that she can handle attacks/jabs from other candidates, but until I (and the country) can see her debate skills, people might think she lacks the ability to take on Trump.
Interesting.  I much preferred the night one vibe because it seemed more substantive and a little less combative for the sake of standing out.   I am also so tired of the assumption that we have to match Trump on his own terms to beat him.  He‚Äôs not a great debater.  He‚Äôs a natural bully which plays itself out on the debate stage but  I can‚Äôt stand to listen to that buffoon for more than five minutes.  I don‚Äôt want to vote for someone who is the Trump of the left.
Agreed. Different strategy for different competitors. She was the frontrunner of night one, She only needed minimal effort to leave the frontrunner. I'm not bashing the plan either. It's a good plan. I just don't think it's the same as winning a debate.
I think the dems are super nervous to get behind true M4A because it means getting rid of insurance when there are many Americans who like their coverage. So I bet he‚Äôs trying to toe the line and not piss off either side of the M4A debate. Same with Harris and her recant the day after.
That premium would exist on a sliding scale according to your income. If we do Sanders style M4A the same sliding scale ‚Äúpremium‚Äù exists just in the form of taxes.
Why do you think Medicare doesn't have premiums?
I don't want to break the "dividing Democrats" rule but if you're interested, you can google "kamala harris prosecution history." There's a NYT op-ed that's really gets into the unprogressive parts of her record as district attorney and attorney general.
Native Hoosier, here. Party ID is a hell of a drug, and IN only has one trajectory - red.  It sucks, but that‚Äôs why Pete has been looking for a platform outside of IN. First his run for DNC chair, now POTUS.
I want Buttigieg to run for his House rep‚Äôs seat. South Bend‚Äôs district was Democrat from 2006-2012. The incumbent Republican won re-election in 2014 and 2016 by a margin of 20 and 23 points respectively. In 2018, she won by 9.   The seat is vulnerable and I think Buttigieg has a great shot of winning. It‚Äôd also give him federal government experience for a future presidential run.
No matter how these primaries turn out, this won't be the last we see of Buttigieg. He's a rising star and guaranteed himself at least a Senate seat, if not VP or President itself.
Ha, that was clever.
That is true. Warren/Harris or Warren/Booker are definitely good choices for a ‚Äúbalanced ticket‚Äù approach.
Warren/Abrams is where it's at
I agree, though I think the Democratic Party would love a VP with strong Rust Belt roots, since taking back Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin seems like the surest path to victory atm. Klobuchar performs really well in Minnesota, but seems to be getting a luke-warm reception on the national stage. Bernie does real well in those areas, but if he doesn't get the nomination, I don't really see him as wanting to be VP (imo he'd be kind of wasted as a VP, as opposed to Senator, anyway).  Castro, Booker, or Harris might translate to a bump with minority demographics and help them flip Florida, which could be a winning strategy, though I'll be tearing my hear out on election night if this Presidency comes down to fucking Florida...
Strongly disliked isn't the right diagnosis of his struggles. Black voters are by and large just barely starting to tune in and as they tune in they'll move away from familiar names like Bernie and Biden and move to new candidates
Now that I think about it, Julian Castro would be my top choice for VP for Warren. There are so many candidates, it‚Äôs hard to keep track.
Maybe a Warren/Castro ticket, I'm definitely happy with a Warren/Booker  ticket though.
While true, Warren is really from the midwest lol  I just really like both since I think Sanders if he doesn't get the nod would be better served in the Senate as opposed to VP. I don't really like Harris, and everyone else is meh.
I wasn‚Äôt even aware they did an AMA in WOTB. That‚Äôs honestly nauseating.   Frankly, it was a poor use of the Senator‚Äôs time to go to S4P on a debate week. While the toxicity is lower compared to total cesspools like WOTB, it is still the centerpiece for many Sanders based conspiracy theories. I think S4P has seen much better days, but, we can agree to disagree on the toxicity level there.   No new votes were won in that echo chamber though. He has the Reddit demographic. He needs to work on expanding his brand but instead he sings the same song and i am getting tired of hearing it as much as I agree with the premise.
What I fear with Sanders is that his presidency would be a disaster and send back the progressive movement decades. I don't see that he has a track record of good governance or ability to get things done.
I'm certain it's in his deck of cards. If shit ever hits the fan that's an easy way to shake things up and get in the news. He doesn't need to court the religious right anymore, I bet there would be  no consequences with his voters.
I dunno. I suppose his website graphics still have Pence's name, so he probably will.
Indeed, Pence is still pretending to be loyal. Someone Trump can confide in, probably. If Trump sacks him, Pence might suddenly change and abandon him.  Basically, they're using each other.
#HueyLewisDidItFirst
I don't know why you'd say that Marianne would do well in a debate with Trump. She was entertaining, sure, but sounding off like a spaced-out hippie isn't gonna do squat in a debate against Trump.
The "average voter" thought Clinton won all of the debates.  *Edit: Just to clarify, I agree that Clinton won the debates. The point is that the "average voter" also agreed that she won and it didn't seem to have any enduring effect.*
Her flip flopping on m4a is off-putting but she indicated support during the debates which is promising. She's clearly ahead of Mayor Pete for me and only slightly behind Sanders, no one else (besides Warren as top choice ofc) seems either competitive or worth my time besides maybe Inslee.
Biden actually pointed this out. He said he was a public defender while she was a prosecutor.
yeah, this - I said "Harris would be a great AG" to someone recently and they basically went *oh honey no* and gave me a bunch of links to read.
> And lastly Biden and that dude from Colorado, no thanks  Hickenlooper or Bennet?

Announcement: To Biden and Bernie supporters do not use this sub to poach voters.
3/5/20 Edit: The rule against poaching voters still stands. It's less than 24hrs since the news that Warren is dropping out has hit. This is not the time to try to recruit voters, and quite frankly comes off as disingenuous and shows a lack of empathy. Also I'd say 80-90% of this sub knows who their number 2 vote is (including myself) and you're not going to convince the remaining \~10% by flooding the queue and comment sections with recruitment spiels. We'll let you know if/when the rule changes.  &#x200B;  For clarification this includes posts/comments that call for unity while explicitly supporting another candidate. Of course "unity in the general election" posts/comments will not be removed. Additionally, this includes calls for Warren to drop out. She'll make her decision to, or not to, drop out when the time is right and antagonizing supporters on this sub by yelling for her to drop out helps no one and obviously isn't going to influence her decision.
and Trump trolls can all fuck off. You guys have 8 more months to enjoy and then it's over.
And a reminder again from team Biden that if you catch anyone from the Biden camp doing it, send the mods at r/JoeBiden a screenshot and they'll be banned from our sub too, they've been very firmly told not to do so and clearly warned it's bannable if they get caught.  (and now I'll fuck off and leave y'all to your sub, just wanted to make sure that option was documented for you if you wanted it)
One concern I am having as well is there is I have seen some talk about preparing for 2024 under an assumption that the Democrat will lose to Trump. I would like it if we don't discuss that possibility unless the Democrat does lose to Trump. I would be disappointed if I saw many of us hoping for that.   I understand that some of you are saying that assuming a President Biden or Sanders doesn't run for reelection and that is fine. I just don't want to be sure we are giving our all to get a Democrat in the White House in 2020.
I‚Äôm just thankful I already cast my vote for Warren!
I have a question about Warren's endorsements. She got so many, per odd local news items each week for months that were never included in the Nate Silver Endorsement Tracker, despite being qualified: Reps, DNC, elected officials, mayors etc - all of the required qualifications.      Was that a campaign decision to not demand they get noticed - to not look like a Hillary-redux? But this went so far in the opposite direction...?
I wanted to make this a post, but I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the right thing for the sub. This looks like a better place to put it.   ‚Äú***You‚Äôre not going to vote my way because someone was mean to you on the internet***‚Äù **a rebuttal.**   I see variants of this statement a lot and I feel it‚Äôs important to address it. On the surface that sounds right because who cares what people say on the internet. Unfortunately that‚Äôs very reductive. It‚Äôs not just people being mean on the internet. There is real cyber bullying. There are death threats and people saying others should kill themselves. I‚Äôve been attacked and seen the screen shots of far worse. There are also people taking this into real life. The night he dropped out, Pete‚Äôs cell phone and some of his staffs cell phone numbers were published by trolls. There are also stories of real life bullying and intimidation.   All that comes from the troll culture that‚Äôs allowed to flourish and is tacitly encouraged. Check any candidates sub around the time they dropped out and you‚Äôll see tons of people telling the Sanders supporters to leave them alone. The brigading, mocking, and harassment is prevalent in all of them, and it‚Äôs all coming from the same faction.   There are many things Bernie could do to help combat this. He could start by removing the trolls from his senior advisor positions, Dave Sirota and Nina Turner. He could institute an engagement policy like Pete‚Äôs rules of the road, he could advise social media moderators to police their platforms like Reddit, he could even condemn specific instances of trolling. There‚Äôs a lot that he could do that would take barely any effort, but he won‚Äôt because that‚Äôs his base and asking the anarchists to be civil would make them flee the ‚Äúmovement‚Äù.  This is why I cannot support Bernie in the primary. It‚Äôs a question of leadership and character. When you run on us vs them and my way or the highway there is no room for dissent or compromise. He‚Äôs only given the barest lip service to telling his supports to tone it down. I do not want to go from one extremist who excites the racists, to another extremist who excites the anarchists.

I see you have not banned those from /r/SWOLANEY/ from continuing their slow but steady poaching ;)  In all seriousness though, great rule. Awesome mod team. Love you guys. Stay strong and Persist!!!
The latest is making us personally responsible for the death of their family or neighbors who will die from lack of health care if we don't run not walk over and support Sanders immediately.  This are of course the same ones who were too pure to vote for Clinton in 2016 even though it has resulted in countless suffering of so many people.  The supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade this year.  How much suffering do they think that will cause?
Can I add that in the event Liz drops out in the next day or so that we take the sub private for a bit after an announcement? Some other subs have done this and I read where some members of the Buttigieg sub wished they had as well as they were brigaded by Sanders supporters before they even had time to process it.
I just heard. Damn it! I wanted her to be the one. I wanted her to break the glass ceiling. This hurts. Coincidentally, my sister also called Elizabeth, told me about it. It sucked. I left and rejoined this sub multiple times because it got too painful. Because I kept looking at polls and seeing how she was doing in the primaries. I left again at Super Tuesday. Super Tuesday was so hard. I even saw a YouTuber I am subscribed (and still am) admitted that he liked Elizabeth Warren but "voted strategically" for Bernie. I remember thinking "SHE IS ONLY ELECTABLE IF YOU FUCKING VOTE FOR HER!"  In 2016, the hardcore, diehard Bernie people swore up and down they would vote for a woman if it was Elizabeth Warren. Not Hillary Clinton, they said. But Elizabeth Warren, they said. This was so painful seeing the vitriol that ended up going to her. People were calling her a snake and a traitor. It was SO awful. People also called her a spoiler. **But math, reality and logic say she wasn't a spoiler. In a ranked voting system where Liz's votes and delegates and gave them all to Bernie AND where all of Mike's votes and delegates went to Joe Biden- Bernie would STILL lose to Biden.** **And Elizabeth Warren voters and supporters DON'T OWE Bernie their support even if she dropped out!** [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/results-super-tuesday-primary-election.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/results-super-tuesday-primary-election.html)  I kept thinking that America is resistant to have ANY woman in power. That women are only okay when they are subordinate to men. The US brags about being enlightened and feminist but it is a lie. Because men here can't bear to temporarily step aside. We are not asking for dominance, we are asking for you to check your ego and step aside 50% of the time. That shouldn't be too much to ask. But for some reason- it is. She was the most qualified and people threw her aside. She had actual plans and they still threw her aside.
Thanks to the mods! I was feeling really depressed by the increased brigading today; I didn‚Äôt want to lose the one place on Reddit I can support Warren openly.
I used this analogy:  They are like a real estate agent at a funeral standing over the casket and demanding that the family allow them to list the house of the recently deceased.  It's ghoulish; it's in poor taste; and it's not going to get them what they want.  Give us space.  Show respect.  Warren is going to do what she chooses to do.  And I will back her to the ends of the earth if need be.  No one is "owed" and no one is "entitled" to her endorsement or her withdrawal.
Thank you for protecting helms deep.
Mods, I‚Äôm sending you my energy for the deluge of trolls and brigadiers coming today. Thank you for your work.
Pete supporter here. Just wanted to say I went through what you guys are going through a few days ago, and know just how tough what you are dealing with is. Hold your heads high and be proud of what you achieved cause you have a lot to be proud of. Peace and respect.
Don't mind me, I'm just here poaching voters for Delaney.
As a Tulsi supporter, I am offended. üôÉ  (/s of course)
From now until November, every time a news article with a candidate pontificates re: solutions to existing problems, we should just going to point them to u/ewarren's plan on it which were still the most forethoughtful, intersectional, pragmatic, and thorough plans on the matter.
Tulsi, who? Lol
Thank you mods for all that you are doing!
Poaching votes is malarkey.
Just wanna say, as a woman, man this one hurt. She‚Äôs a baddie. I hope she comes back in 2024 to run again and will love to see her in the senate going forward.
Thank you. ü•∫

Don‚Äôt worry, as long as EW is in it, so are we! #CourageOverCynicism
I'm hear to poach votes on behalf of Rocky De la Fuente
I was gonna vote for Pete, so I understand the sinking feeling too well. Hope you all the best. Our candidates may not have won, but i firmly believe that the arguments they were able to put out on the national stage had value in an of themselves. In the end we are all Americans who just want this country to do well, and that should bring us together no matter who our hearts tell us to vote for.
[There is a right way to poach](https://youtu.be/CFatEWNx5RQ?t=305)
Hi Mods, can we get a weekly banter thread stickied back up?
First off - sorry that people in a camp with me are doing that - its stupid.  Second - why would anyone with half a brain want her to drop out now? We have a debate coming up in which she would be one of 3 candidates - with no Amy/Pete/Bloomer bullshit.  I'd love to see someone who can reign in the hyperbole from the other two candidates and keep things on topic.  Her staying in is literally a great thing for dems.
This community is really important to a lot of people. I want it to stay a community for people who believe in the future Elizabeth Warren sees. This mod should continue to be a mod centering around support for Warren -- even if she's out of this race, she's got a lot to say and even more to fight for. Please, don't let this sub become brigaded by Sanders supporters (lets be honest: Biden supporters don't brigade).  Thank you mods, please keep this up!
press F for the mods on this sub today
USApolitics is getting flooded with Bros turning their hate on Biden.  I hope Liz doesn't back anyone until after the primary.  This Warren supporter is going to Biden.
whoever y'all go to..... lets get trump out of office!
>(Also no poaching for Tulsi if that needed to be said)  Way to kick her while she's down.
To the Bernie supporters trying to poach here, this is from another Bernie supporter, go the fuck home, they don‚Äôt want you here, any rational Bernie supporter doesn‚Äôt want you here. You‚Äôre not helping them, you‚Äôre not helping Bernie. I‚Äôm sorry for the trolls guys.

Just remember one thing: Obviously today is a depressing day for those who have put so much time and effort into this campaign, but this is *not* the end. Warren is roughly ten years younger than either Biden or Sanders. After 2016, supporters of both Biden *and* Sanders faced a deluge of "no way can he run next time, he'll be too old" remarks even from people who had supported either respective campaign at the time of Biden announcing he wouldn't run, or Sanders losing the primary, respectively. And now, one of them will be this year's Democratic nominee. If they can do it, you bet your ass Warren can do it as well; Be it in 2028, or (heavens forbid) in 2024 in the event of a loss in November. Apart from her own personal choice as it may be, there are no reasons whatsoever that she shouldn't run in the future, and therefore be considered a potential future candidate by everyone who supports her.  I realise this is obviously cold comfort, but it *is* something to hold on to. It got Sanders and Biden supporters through the aftermath of the 2016 primary and even more so after the election result, and after several years of waiting and wondering, both camps got their wish. It wouldn't surprise me in the least if Warren decided to give it another go the next time there's a Democratic Primary to be held, and she'll benefit from both the experience of this primary with any lessons or strategic insights it has provided, and the infrastructure she's built up during the last two years. That support isn't going anywhere.  As far as idiot concern trolls and vote poachers go, my honest advice would be to simply disengage from online political discussions at least for a few days. I remember the absolute dumpster fire that was the internet in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 convention *and* election, and in all honesty I found it easier to just go cold turkey for a week or two until the dust had settled and there'd been time to mourn and reflect. It absolutely sucks that there are so many assholes out there who either want to intentionally screw with peoples' feelings for fun, or are too emotionally brain-dead to recognise that there are some times when you just back off and leave people alone. Having said that, short of the mods making this sub private and only accepting posts from approved users, the logistics or difficulty of which I honestly don't know anything about, the best course for me in '16 was to just get off social media and surround yourself with friendly faces. Either that, or be very, very selective about which spaces you bother giving your time to and who you bother engaging with over the next few days while this is still horribly raw.  Just my two cents anyway!

Regardless of what happens i think we can all agree trumps gotta go one way or another. The man is terrifying.
What Biden supporters are on Reddit? :P
I want to say that I know what that felt like at the last primary/convention and I am cool with both Warren and Sanders. I get it, and I still stand with you. It accomplishes nothing to mock or judge each other.
Am I the only one surprised that Biden campaign even has a subreddit?

On a related topic, utterly shocked + please by cenk's graciousness in defeat.

Don‚Äôt know how I can have a history in this sub if I just came to find other supporters who arent on twitter where I will get abused.
Mods, can we get another banter thread up and stickied? Been missing those lately.
No worries. I came in to report people from our team (staying anonymous) who have come over from our team to our mods who try and do that. Totally understand that you gotta grieve.
I'm sure the 6 votes they get aint gonna matter
[removed]
I supported another candidate, but I'm not going to go into that. You guys and gals take care of yourselves. You should be proud of what you accomplished. Take a walk, play with your pets, have a good meal. These things hurt, but you're going to get through this and keep fighting for those plans and big structural changes.
[removed]
Bernie supporter, not trying to poach voters, I just want to say Warren was always my second choice and I really respected her, her voters, and her campaign. My heart goes out to all of you
I would also comment that I would be wary of insulting comments from Biden/Bernie supporters... I wish I had screenshot it before the account disappeared, but I found a really nasty "Bernie" supporter who up until a few months ago had tons of pro-trump posts. Be careful when you see fake supporters of Biden or Bernie who are just trying to stir the pot and create negative images.     Thank you Elizabeth!
My condolences, she ran a great race and was my #2 stay strong during these trying times ‚ô°

Assuming Trump actually voluntarily vacates the office after he loses.  I'm not so sure he will.
A-fucking-men.
I know I don't belong here but came to echo this sentiment.   If you haven't voted in the primaries yet, vote as you see fit. But in the general election, please please PLEASE show up and vote blue no matter who.  Republican and Russian trolls seek to sow discord in the Democratic party. If you see any vile or bad faith content then denounce it, report it, and move on.
The ‚Äúlol so you guys will vote for Nikki Haley/Ivanka in 2024‚Äù is really making me nauseous.   Like fucking no you are missing the fucking point.
I'm not confident of that. We just lost the one candidate who could easily have beaten him.
Unless a certain someone is the nominee.
There's no way on Earth Trump will lose to Biden, it's the same thing as 2016.
oh man it sounds like drumpf is surely done for now
remindme! 9 months
Unless Biden gets the nomination
God I really hope so. I've never been so scared in my life. I'm pretty young still 23 so I haven't seen a ton of elections but My dad said hes never seen anything like this and He is very concerned about what happens in November.
Can anyone explain this?? https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-says-he-s-open-republican-running-mate-n1108931
Lmao not happening.
*4 years and 8 months :P
Yep and I want to say as a Pete/Warren/Biden pinch hitter, I received a nasty recruitment message supposedly from the Biden camp (a lot of people did if they posted in the discussion thread last night).   Looking in their profile, they were a Trump supporter. So there are no doubt assholes in every camp, but also be on the lookout for shit-stirrers that want to play up existing divisions.
We really appreciate this. I love how often sports team subs have a rule like this and I think it's great.
Human decency? In my democracy?
I wish Bernie‚Äôs sub would do this. I am on the Bernie train and last night it felt like r/Sandersforpresident was terrible. The posters calling everyone idiots, blaming black people for not voting in their interests, blaming Warren for hurting Bernie. We need to be based in reality and what I saw last night was certainly not.   It felt weird though... every post was made to fan the flames. In my mind any true supporter of the movement that builds from a foundation of empathy and connecting to the pain of the working class would never act like that. I really think anyone coming here as a Bernie supporter and not empathizing with Warren is not truly a part of his movement. Sorry in advance for anything you see from that camp.   I like Warren a lot. I‚Äôd be ecstatic with either of them as the nominee.
Thank you.
I really appreciate that ‚ù§Ô∏è
Major respect to you guys for doing that.
[removed]
how is this comment, complete with a link to the sub, not exactly what's being banned?  if you aren't trying to win over voters by pitching subreddit rule unity, shouldn't you just have sent this as a DM to the mod team here?
I think Biden has indicated that he wouldn't pursue a 2nd term. I think due to their ages, two terms is unlikely for either of them. I don't think Warren would run again in 2024 either way.
Oh God yes!  We won't survive another Trump term intact as a country.  I firmly believe that.
You can still vote for her though, if you wanted to. Not sure for how long but she's still on the ballot in the next up states for sure.  I mean not that you should or shouldn't, but if you wanted to
I‚Äôm going to have to change my vote üò¢.  I just can‚Äôt bring myself to vote for Bernie. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Biden either, but I do have a lot of respect for him.
I may be wrong, but I believe the tracker is superdelegates and a very limited set of others (e.g. Mayors (but only of cities of a certain size), former candidates, etc.). I doubt the campaign had anything to do with it. 538 set criteria at the beginning and has just stuck with it.
I don't think she got Hillary-levels of endorsements did she? Was she first in the Endorsement Tracker, and by how much?
> It‚Äôs a question of leadership and character. When you run on us vs them and my way or the highway there is no room for dissent or compromise. He‚Äôs only given the barest lip service to telling his supports to tone it down. I do not want to go from one extremist who excites the racists, to another extremist who excites the anarchists.   Thank you so much for saying this!  It is spot on.  When his supporters sneer at us for caring about the kind of people he welcomes into his "movement" they are making it worse; and not better.  There are no other candidate supporters that behave anywhere near the way his supporters do.
The part that makes me question his leadership, in regards to the web trolls/bullies, is this:  He had four years to figure this out!  It was well known they were a target of malicious web campaigns. Yet Sanders and his chosen leadership thought it best to let his online campaign go on a vodka fueled Lord of the Flies bender. Either they supported the malice or were incapable of stopping it. If they cannot maintain a progressive message online then how'd they expect to inspire faith they could follow through in congress! Populism makes for poor politics.
It‚Äôs moot now because he can‚Äôt beat Biden esp now that Bloomberg is out, but Bernie was my second choice. However, I completely understand agreeing with him ideologically but not having faith in him as a leader. He‚Äôs staked his whole political strategy not on reaching out and on working with Congress, but on outsider grassroots political organizing rallying and leaning on Congress democratically. Thing is, it‚Äôs become clear that this ‚Äúmovement‚Äù will simply mean harassing and doxxing and bullying and using homophobic or ableist slurs against Congress‚Äîand towards anyone and everyone who doesn‚Äôt participate in these actions and thinks they‚Äôre ineffective and wrongly-directed practices. Class unity suddenly goes out the window if you‚Äôre not 100% in lockstep with these people.  Much of Bernie‚Äôs movement is a farce and I‚Äôve come to see that now. Economic anxiety finally affected white liberals and they radicalized themselves online and coopted the progressive message (minus the inclusivity and intersectionality) and reduced it down to ‚ÄúPraxis is calling him Pete Buttplug.‚Äù   They‚Äôve reduced real progressive and revolutionary ideology down to an internet game. I don‚Äôt believe in this movement at all any more. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs righteous and I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs effective. I do still 100% believe in progressivism though and I‚Äôm excited to see where post-Bernie progressivism takes us.   Edit to add: whenever I point out the problem of white male rage, inevitably a white male Sanders supporter says it can‚Äôt be the case because Sanders has the most diverse base. Which is true, because he‚Äôs learned from black activists in the civil rights movement and from South American revolutionaries. He‚Äôs working off a platform people of color built. But, the thing is, I‚Äôve never been harassed or had threatening DMs from a woman of color Sanders supporter. Or from a woman at all. And rarely even from a man of color. It‚Äôs not about that part of the base. It‚Äôs about the white men who ruin it for everyone else.
Well said. I intended to switch my financial and volunteering support to Bernie after Super Tuesday if he was ahead of her in delegate count at this point. I maxed out my donation to Warren and joined the text team just before NH. But I am very reluctant to start supporting Bernie now, thanks to the toxicity I have seen from his camp for many weeks now. I will likely sit it out until the convention, and donate to and volunteer for the eventual nominee.   I value decency and civility in politics, and I am reluctant to support a candidate who doesn't stand for those values. In the general going up against Trump, everyone on our side is decent and civil by comparison.
It's textbook abuser Behavior, I see it repeated often, and I'm absolutely sick of it. Some months and months of enduring the most vile shit, only to have them do a 180 and say hey, now vote for him, really turned me off the campaign. I don't have her as my second choice for a variety of other reasons, but I would be lying and saying that that wasn't one of them
More than that, for some of us who were Clinton supporters in 2016, each of these comments comes loaded with of all the falsehoods and blatant misogyny of that cycle.
Elizabeth Warren blasts the plastic straw debate as a fossil fuel industry distraction tactic ‚ÄúGive me a break.‚Äù
True leadership.  She keeps saying the stuff that I scream at my TV during these things.    I keep having to tell myself that she has been consistent and a fighter on the issues for years.  I am really excited to vote for Warren, but I don't want to get Obama'd on this one.
This is great. Source: https://www.vox.com/2019/9/5/20850490/elizabeth-warren-climate-change-forum-2020
See now this is a candidate who actually "tells it like it is." Warren isn't afraid to blast questions like this and you don't have to worry about her sugarcoating her answers either.
My wife just shared that with me and I immediately signed up for a recurring $100 monthly donation for her campaign.  I donated when she ran for Senate but for some reason I realized I hadn't donated since she announced her Presidential bid.  I know Warren doesn't accept donations from PACs but one of the things me and my friends did when Hillary ran was that we organized a dinner where the buy-in was $1500 and donated the proceeds to Clinton. Would love to organize something similar for Warren - could easily raise a few hundred thousand from people who really care. And that was just a small group of us in one city!

If we are lucky enough to call her POTUS we are gonna also have to do our part to flip the Senate if we really want to see what a Warren presidency can do.
Woo! As well as outright straw bans being very ableist.     EDIT: I'm glad this has sparked some good discussion. I encourage people to look at some of the links in the sub comments as well as googling "Straw bans disability" as there is a lot of great info by people who can speak a lot better than me about why many disabled people and disability advocacy groups oppose universal straw bans. I want to reduce plastic waste, but not at the expense of disabled people dying or not having access to public life.  I'm going to bow out now as I have no more spoons for the day, bless you all.
Scary level of common sense. Plastic waste is a huge problem but quantities matter. And the mass of a straw is almost nothing.  What are key problems worth tackling? What are the right levers? These things matter if one wants to have constructive impact. Particularly if you are not all powerful like a US president.
She's right here, but you know what ban would really have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and actually fighting climate change?  Fracking.

It gets people talking about conservation.
Is carbon dioxide a pollutant? Please clarifying for me
I take it she's never watched A Plastic Ocean or The True Cost. We have to take matters into our own hands. There will never be a climate policy that shows light to all the horrific consequences of the modern western lifestyle. Yes our country is clean(for the most part) but a large amount of trash such as tires and plastics are shipped overseas and dumped in the ocean or burned.
No need for the concern. Obama didn't have any real history to give an indication as to how he would govern, Liz has made it clear who she's fighting for.
I feel she can actually get things done. I mean I'll vote for whoever wins the nomination, but damn do I hope it's her. I feel as if she's the parent America needs. She knows how to work with everyone, and she's smarter than almost anyone I've encountered. Her first job out of college was a special ed teacher. She's just awesome in so many ways. Sorry fanirling
Aside from the content (which is phenomenal), I just love the way she attacks the question. She gives an honest first reaction (with a laugh and "Oh come on. Give me a break."), refuses to be pigeonholed ("Is that a yes? No.") and then gives a concise, and eloquent explanation of the real problem and why the question is flawed. Beautifully done.
where can i clip this video they have
That's fantastic! I'm so happy your inspiration has been reignited! Those dinner parties sound wonderful, too.
Hope the food was good for that dinner.
Everyone going vegan would make a huge difference.
How?
might wanna Google that

She didn't say they were not a problem, she said that they were being used as a distraction from the big problems by industry.
Couple of key structural differences between Warren in 2021 vs Obama in 2009:  * She'll come into office with a much stronger mandate than Obama. By expresely beating a sitting president, that's the country vociferously saying, "No, fuck that." to Republican policies. Obama, while riding the wave of change from Bush, wouldn't be as expresely a refutation as Warren beating Trump would be, rather it was just the pendulum swinging back the other way. Instead, she'd be able to paint it just as Republicans did with the "Reagan Revolution" when Carter was beaten.  * 2020 Redistricting. With any luck, her win will be a wave that yields a lot of state houses. Either they'll be made more fair or they'll be gerrymandered blue (the former I'm for on principal, whereas the revanchist part of me prefers the latter) which either way means less Dems are in danger in 2022 and so more would be more willing to go out on a limb for more leftward legislation.  * Fighting different stereotypes. Obama was a bit hamstrung making leftward changes due in part to being first black president. Since Reagan, Republicans had been trying to tie the welfare state with blackness in an effort to dismantle it. That made it harder for Obama to try and actively help the poor because Republicans would and did actively try to make it a black thing. Warren will have to deal with her own stereotypes from being a woman, but that doesn't come with as much groundwork laid by Republicans. Most of that was instead expresely and personally targeted towards Clinton.  * Democrats have wised up quite a bit in the last decade in so far as Republicans not acting in good faith. The thing to remember is in 2009, it was hoped that it'd be a return to the normalcy of before the Gingrich era, which circa 2008 was only 14 years prior with many a congressperson still sitting from before then. Instead, McConnel, et. al opted for scorched earth. So to get anything done, unanimity was needed among Democrats which meant getting on board the most conservative and corrupt (read: Lieberman) and then after 2010, dealing with a hostile congress.
Plus, I blame us for a lot of Obama's failures. We got him into office and then went away. After Trump, we can't go away. Even with Liz in the white house, she'll need us fighting for her policies and holding her feet to the fire as well.  Getting her into office is the beginning, not the end.
I just worry that she's too good to be true.  The biggest scandal/issue with her is her claim of NA ancestry that had zero impact on her hiring.  Where are the skeletons?  I'm so unused to a politician being this clean
[Mother Jones shared it on their Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B2BBF-zAX54/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet).
The real answer is sustainable vs unsustainable agriculture. We need animals in order to grow plants.   We need to revert monoculture farming to grasslands which require ruminant animals like bison. I can show you an animal-based diet with a negative carbon footprint vs a vegan one with tropical foods flown in from all over the world and methane-producing rice paddies.   We need to fight desertification of grasslandlands which represent 30% of land surface and which are a huge, powerful carbon sink and water retention and filtration device. Those require ruminant animals to function properly.   https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI
[Solutions to Climate Change Ranked] (https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank)  It is the 4th most impactful thing that we can do to combat climate change.  I get the sentiment about plastic straws and things like that but while recycling is way down the list going vegetarian or vegan or even just limiting meat consumption is actually a very useful way to combat the problem.
Disabled people use single use plastic straws so they can drink. the alternatives do not work for everyone or for many uses that disabled people need them for.     [https://ramblingjustice.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/infographics-for-strawban-suckitableism-advocates/](https://ramblingjustice.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/infographics-for-strawban-suckitableism-advocates/)      Here's some helpful graphics and info to explain why the many alternatives that people suggest aren't always great. We need to hold companies accountable and not pass it on to the most vulnerable populations on something that is fairly small compared to commercial waste.      Making straws on request only in public places reduces straw usage by over 60% Similar things about water refills back in the California drought, many only did refills or water on request. Big changes can be made without harming disabled people, but I've heard a lot from others dismissing our concerns (not saying you- you just asked a question) .   People ask well what about before straws, and the fact is many disabled people aspirated, got bacterial and viral infections especially in immune compromised persons, puncture injuries from metal straws, choking, etc. Disabled people died .      And for those who always say bring your own, the issue for us is, for someone normally who forgets their straw they are inconvenienced. For a disabled person, it can mean they cannot ingest fluids or food. Therefore straws are an accessibility adaptation that businesses should at least have on hand or else it reduces our access to many parts of life.
because its super hard for a ton of disabled people to drink anything unless they have a straw. take any person with moderate to severe parkinsons for example
Kamala Harris stated in the climate town hall that she would ban fracking as well.
Warren has made it clear she's on the Lock Them Up train.
[deleted]
Its the difference between someone in politics because they want power and someone in politics who truly feels they can help and has a real desire to make things better. We have entirely too much of the first type and almost none of the last.
You've forgotten Obama already? He had zero scandals, and his biggest 'crime' was he smoked pot as a youth.
Thank you for that.
oh I see what you're saying.  I disagree with it completely, but thank you for making your point in a polite manner.
yep single use plastic straws were originally created for disabled person's use.    Before, aspiration, infection, and puncture injuries up to even death were happening due to the alternatives being mostly metal straws at the time.
wow, ok then.
So much can be fixed with our country if we appoint regulators and not lobbyists to head departments.  There's a ton of this corruption that just gets ignored because that's just how it is.
The Senate AND something has to be done with the courts. All it takes is one federal judge or one SCOTUS decision and anything Warren or any Democrat passes gets stopped.
Bullshit revisionist history
I'm not sure which part you disagree with but NPR did a great thing explaining it   [https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/07/11/627773979/why-people-with-disabilities-want-bans-on-plastic-straws-to-be-more-flexible](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/07/11/627773979/why-people-with-disabilities-want-bans-on-plastic-straws-to-be-more-flexible)   as well as CNN, washingtonpost, and many other major news outlets.      I'm sorry if I seem a bit defensive on this, it's an access thing that is life and death for people. I do feel it's a privilege to be able to disagree on an accessibility accommodation. It would be like saying, I disagree with having ramps or having doors someone can get through or a counter at a height I can wash my hands while seated.
The first patent for a straw was in 1888, Sumerians 5000 years ago used straws. Get out of here that they were created for disabled people. 5000 years ago disabled people were put to death very often and the straws were to reach under sedimentary byproducts from fermentation so you didn't get crap in your mouth while you drank beer.
Yeah can't say I agree with that on Obama. He was decent but not great. Kulinski did a video on how "the tan suit is his only scandal" line is BS
Oh good, you cited at least one source instead of bleating on like some mindless shee... oh you didn't. Oh.
I disagree with the part that the entire sum of humanity needs to use straws because a few people find them medically necessary.  You obviously expected that logical response as you preemptively attempted to address the issue of just bringing your own straw, but only dug the hole much deeper.  might as well be arguing that everyone should be forced to wear giant plastic bibs because some people are unable to keep soup off their polo shirts.   sure, some people wear polo shirt and are unable to keep soup off them, but should the whole of humanity have to wear the bibs because of their situation?   I argue no.
I think you misunderstood me or didn't read my comment completely. I specifically stated single use plastic straws. Which were absolutely created for disabled people, and were first rolled out in hospitals and institutions.
It started appearing all at once, did Kulinski talk about origins of this? My guess is David Brock or some other moderate Dem propagandist
You need me to list all of Obama's war crimes?  All of the illegal shit he did while in office?  This was well reported on during his presidency.  I was responding to an absolutely absurd comment flippantly.
They didn‚Äôt say the entire sum of humanity must be using plastic straws, they said businesses should have them on hand for if/when they are requested to be considerate of those who may need them. You can still argue no, but your comparison with plastic bibs is pretty outside the scope of the point that the OC was trying to make. I find it hard to believe that anyone arguing against a universal straw ban is interested in forcing anyone to use straws like your comment is getting at.
Hospitals were among the first to embrace bendable straws, because they allowed patients to drink while lying in bed. These were still made from paper. ALL straws progressed to plastic eventually because they were easier to manufacture. It had nothing to do with disabilities. It was after WWII when the manufacture (especially plastic manufacturing) had no further use doing what it was initially used for and had to convert to non-wartime uses.
His video was in response to a Chris Hayes segment. But tbh it's normal to whitewash former presidents, and in contrast to trump it's easy to do
this. Just like how there is stairs and elevators, everyone who is able is welcome and in fact encouraged to use the stairs. But the elevator is there if you need. Or like how airports have those carts with seating for like four people, not everyone needs a ride on them, but they have that service thankfully if you do. (fun note airports and flights don't have to follow ADA at all- they have their own legal standing that is unique)   I know like a local place has both these like cellulose/corn straws and single use plastic ones for those with allergies and needs. I'm not allergic to corn but do need the stability of a straw so I use the corn ones. But I have a friend with a life threatening allergy to corn and motor issues and she uses the plastic ones. I absolutely want to reduce plastic waste. They have a sign on the bucket of corn ones, saying plastic available on request, which they keep behind the counter.  Simple method but they said they hardly ever get anyone asking and has reduced it by a lot.
I believe you're making a bad faith argument and completely misunderstood the conversation.
and there are also many reasons paper straws don't always work for disabled people. Hospitals also preferred plastic because the paper straws dissolved too quickly (especially for patients that ate/drank very slowly) and didn't work very well for hot liquids. "They allowed people to drink in bed" exactly, an adaptation they needed (see above about aspiration, choking, puncture wounds). The plastic was another. And yes it was also cheaper. The demand preceded the switch to plastic but disabled history is often washed over. yes positionable single use plastic straws were created for those who needed them. Either way my original point absolutely still stands. For the first ten years of it, it was hospitals and institutions. Only after did it spread to the general population. And since we no longer shut our disabled people in institutions (usually) , the need spread.    Maybe listen to disabled voices on this. There is a lot of information out there if you want to understand why plastic straw bans are being protested by those with disabilities. And maybe try to be kinder and less quick to anger without reading the whole comment.
You misconstrued "businesses should have straws available for disabled people" as "everyone should be required to use straws".  The person your responding to isn't the one arguing in bad faith.
I AM disabled you asshat.
and I believe you've misunderstood the conversation as well, as "businesses should have" is the same thing as "everyone should have" because the everyone that we were discussing is businesses. It's a bad faith argument to suggest we're talking about forcing people to have them in their kitchens, which (I think?) is what you're saying the conversation was about.
then why are you being so aggressive to someone trying to explain as well about something the history and why it's important to disabled people?. You didn't acknowledge you read my initial comment incorrectly, you continued to be aggressive when indeed I meant the introduction into hospitals and institutions as yes creating for disabled people, though his daughter drinking a milkshake gave him the first idea. My original point that you told me to "get out of here" was first off, not the point I said or the one you responded to, and 2, something we both have now agreed, yes first they were in hospitals. So I'm confused as to why you have been aggressive from the get go. I feel as if maybe you are misunderstanding me. Can you try and see from my point of view?
Just my two cents...
The billionaires counter is that they don't have enough liquid to pay the tax year after year. They'll have to sell assets to foreigners (other billionaires). Not really our problem, but just letting you know their point of view.
It's time to turn billionaires into millionaires
Fuck yes
"You can afford a private sex island.."  FTFY
This should be 4 cents for everything over 200 mm, and 8 cents over 500mm
Let‚Äôs just repossess all the islands! Big brain time
Though I feel any smart rich person would simply change citizenship, move their wealth overseas but keep a few mansions in the US. Then maintain an annual 6 month tourist visa and live in their mansions. Completely avoid the tax without significantly impacting your lifestyle, and now you have a winter and summer home.
It is actually 6%.  And when you consider it requires liquidating assets that pull in capital gains taxes it mushrooms into over 8%.  That's assuming we don't tax capital gains at ordinary income rates but if we do that makes it closer to 10%.  That's repeated every single year until their wealth drops below $1B.
Who cares what their point of view is.  If you have horded obscene wealth, it is time you start paying up.    They should be glad it is only 2%.  They should be glad we don‚Äôt swap the rates on capitol gains and income from actual work.  Billionaires are sad they might have to sell assets?  Boo fucking hoo.  Try having to sell blood.
I'll just tell the government I can't pay my taxes because what I owe is currently not liquid since it's locked up in things like food and rent.
Shouldn't spend beyond their wealth then...
The non-billionaire counter is that it's not about if they can afford it, but if it's just a good idea in the first place. At that level of wealth, assets are notoriously hard to value -- we can assess the value of a house that had 3 others in the same neighborhood sell in the last year, but a private island?  There's also the fundamental problem that paying for programs by taking massive wealth means you need a society that continues to produce massive wealth. If 10 years into the plan, the tax base has been cut in half then it's probably not a sustainable plan.
Warren's plan actually provides a solution to people facing liquidity problems. It is not a good excuse on their part.  Then, she placed the tax high enough that there will be few enough people paying the tax that they can dedicate manpower to people who are in unique situations.  This is no different to the tens-of-thousands of people who find themselves in unique problems with income tax. Just look at all the people who made a ton of money on bitcoin, cashed out (incurring taxes) then put it back in only to lose it all. Bitcoin folk can have some pretty messed up taxes. Never heard anyone use that as a good reason to end all income taxes.
Why do they have to sell assets to foreigners? There's plenty of people here in America too.
Maybe they should call a payday loan place. Debt slavery works for the rest of us, so why not them?
And broke people into financially steady people
Warren's plan doesn't reduce net worth. The tax isn't high enough to stop growth only to slow the speed of growth.
It‚Äôs 6% on every dollar over $1 billion, which I think is conceptually similar! There‚Äôs a big chance increasing the rate for a bracket below that point would make it harder to pass, since a 4% tax would potentially nullify asset growth. (I personally don‚Äôt particularly care if people aren‚Äôt seeing asset growth on wealth above $200 mil, but logistically it‚Äôs important.)
This is Bernie's plan. He decided to copy Warren, but make it harsher because that fits his brand.
[deleted]
No it should not.  If the wealth tax is larger than the reasonable expectation of profit from investing then younger wealthy people will flee.  The reason why Warren‚Äôs tax caps out where it does is because it is based on that rate of return.  If we have an 8% wealth tax then people like Zuckerberg have no reason to remain US citizens as the 40% exit tax would still be smaller than an 8% annual wealth tax.  Sanders‚Äô policy was created to make people who don‚Äôt understand taxes and finance feel good compared to Warren‚Äôs which was created to practically reduce economic inequality.
Which is why most countries that have had wealth taxes have gotten rid of them. They‚Äôre expensive to administrate and easy to make loopholes out of.
2% now or an extremely violent and bloody revolution of the plutocracy at some point in the next 30 years.
> Who cares what their point of view is.  It depends on the audience. If the point is to persuade people, then it makes sense to care what other people think. If the point's just to cheer lead, then it doesn't matter.
The argument isn't that they hoarded wealth.  Bezos founded a company and owns a significant portion of it and people decided minuscule fractions of that company are worth over $2000 apiece.  That's not hoarded wealth.  He literally created something of value.  Whether he did that fairly or not is another discussion.
It's as if those two things would give the US a healthy, stable economy for everyone.
I've watched all of the debates, and ya know, I don't recall turning broke people into financially stable people really coming up. Taxing the wealthy definitely did, but ...where's the financially stabilizing people part?
This is why I think it is funny any billionaire would cry about being taxed more, they are still going to be billionaires.
Good. I like it when politicians take notes from other politician's ideas, especially ideas from Warren. Why would that be a bad thing?
Not sure that's productive to say, mate. Are you implying Bernie is running on a platform of being harsh and punitive? Because that's pretty much the complete opposite of anything he's put out to date
He is polling your leg, that is Bernie's plan.
You are trying to persuade the 1%?
-student loan forgiveness -healthcare w/out premiums, copays, & deductibles  -tuition free college -universal childcare -paid family leave -raising the minimum wage -lowering housing costs
Warren has quite a lot more than 12 minutes worth of ideas. The debates were never a good venue to learn about policy ideas in 75 second bursts.  !WarrenPlanBot show me the plans!
-student loan forgiveness -healthcare w/out premiums, copays, & deductibles  -tuition free college -universal childcare -paid family leave -raising the minimum wage -lowering housing costs
This assumes a healthy economy that allows them to grow their wealth by more than 10% per year.  While that has been true the past 4 or more years that will not always be the case and it is difficult to grow wealth when the main driver of that wealth (i.e. more wealth) is taken away.  It would be like if you were only allowed to work 20 hours per week.
I agree,though it'd be nice to see them lose wealth. Sad Warren doesn't go far enough.
It is not a bad thing. We are trying to vote for the best possible implementation of the best possible ideas. Warren had way better tax proposals than Bernie, so Bernie beefed up his tax plans with hers.
Bernie is against Billionaires. That's on brand.  Warren: "I don't have a beef with Billionaires-"   Bernie: "I do"  Sorry if you disagree, but I can not interpret that any other way then he is against billionaires.
I forgot what the extra tier she had was (6% over 1 billion)
There's a whole lot of people who think that it's at least worthwhile to hear them out and see if they have any good arguments. "I don't care what they say" makes it sound like the policy can't stand up to scrutiny.
So if I don't have student loans, don't gave kids, any already getting Medicaid because my income is so low, and my work isn't paid hourly, ... does any of this help me?

I'm an adjunct professor with a couple freelance side gigs, single, no student loans, receiving Medicaid (though I've been fortunate enough to never have to use it anyways). Anything in those plans help me out?
Yeah, that doesn't make me feel sad for billionaires.
Any wealthy person who complains should be taxed more.
Yeah but how does that translate to him being harsh? Didn't know caring for 99% of Americans and disliking the top 1% that exploited the rest was a bad thing. I mean, jeez, are you *for* billionaires or something?
Ya, that was in her M4A pay for plan.     But something very important to keep in mind, she wont be Supreme Ruler once she wins (though, with how the Senate Trial is shaping up...) so she can't pass legislation exactly as she wants it. So, no matter what exact numbers she campaigns on, they will change as they go through congress.     I am hoping we can put enough pressure on our local representatives that we can force them to go along with Warren. But they will still make changes to the plans.
I‚Äôve been listening to their shit since the 1990‚Äôs.  I know what they want.  They want more.  They are children and should be ignored.
I‚Äôve been out of work with a disability for a while, don‚Äôt have kids, and am also on Medicaid. The point is that the  taxes that go on the ultra-wealthy all get redistributed to programs that help stabilize the life, health, and economic mobility of everyday people.   For example, I‚Äôm (finally) starting a new job soon but it‚Äôs as a contractor in a temp-to-hire situation. My increased income is a good thing BUT I likely will lose Medicaid benefits. And since I‚Äôm a contractor I‚Äôm not eligible for health benefits through my employer so I‚Äôll need to switch to plan through the Marketplace which in my experience suck compared to Medicaid.  W/ Warren‚Äôs healthcare plan I could have health benefits that travel with me, regardless of employment status or income. That would be a godsend. And the ability to go back to college or trade school w/out tuition? That would totally open the door for me to change career paths and thus, bring home more Benjamins.
Anti-corruption: Make the government start working for you again. Instead of just serving an ever slimmer margin at the top.  Environmental: We all live on the planet, we might want to consider taking better care of it.  Societal: You may not benefit from her plans on childcare, health care, and education. But you do live in a society where you rely on the goods and services produced by other people. Reduced poverty and increased education help FAR more than just those who actively use it.   I too, will receive very few benefits from most of her plans. I am already almost done with my Master's degree, I work for the government so my healthcare is take care of, I don't have kids, etc. etc. But the engineer who gets to graduate in 2025 because they had the opportunity from Warren's plan will go on to build and invent. Maybe they will make some new toy I love. Maybe they will make the device that cures an ailment I don't know I currently have. Hell, maybe they just get a decent job, doesn't fall into substance abuse and they never mugs me or car jacks me because people who are taken care of don't commit as many crimes.  Anything in there interest you?
Freedom of speech prohibits that.  And we tried that already.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/irs-targeting-tea-party-liberals-democrats.html
I don't know about that. If you support billionaires losing wealth Bernie's your option. Warrens plan slow the growth rate of their wealth while Bernie's tax reduces billionaires net worth.
It sounds like you favor 'harsher' taxes on billionaires.  Do you favor 'softer' taxes on billionaires?   IDK, I think you and I just define "harsher" differently. Or maybe you are adding subtext to my comment that I don't see.
Totally agree with that. My fear is that whenever she makes a compromise, though, the Never Warren peeps will use that as ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that she‚Äôs a liar, snake, blah blah blah   No matter who wins, we‚Äôll need someone who can make deals and negotiate with the moderates in the Senate. I feel like Warren is best equipped for that over Bernie.
I'm not talking about the billionaires, I'm talking about the rest of the voting public. If the message is "we're not even going to listen to everyone involved in this," then it doesn't come across as a very well thought out policy. "Billionaires are greedy" doesn't answer the question of how to value a private island.
Is there any candidate who doesn't have making the government start working for us again as part of their platform? Or is she notably different on climate change from anyone else?  On education, I'm a bit hazy on her policy as it regards private universities.  So one of the things that got me interested in Warren years ago was her policy on student loan interest rates. There's no reason the federal government should profit off student loans -- wealth redistribution *from* recent graduates is bonkers. (At the time, I was research director for an education policy NGO and a big focus for us was how universities use debt-financed tuition dollars to fund scholarships, basically transferring money from the least privileged students to the most privileged, so naturally her take on loans got my attention.)  Anyways though, she talks about free public university which I think is great, but isn't entirely clear on private universities. Her policy page just mentions making higher education "of all kinds" more accessible. If she is able to wipe out student loan debt, what happens to the next cohort of students going to private universities?
Yeah, I am aware of that. Did you think I was serious? Fuck billionaires, especially the whiny ones.
I support both, though I will be voting for Bernie in the primary.
It's about the framing of your argument. Yes, Bernie favors higher taxes for billionaires. He needs to in order to pay for his more ambitious and progressive plans. But notice how I said higher instead of harsher? One sounds neutral, because it is, and the other twists the context into implying that Bernie is a punitive person when he just wants people to pay their fair share.   If I used your logic, I could easily say that Warren is soft on billionaires and favors them *because* her tax rates aren't as high as Bernie's. There's a reason why the fair share argument has been used lately, because nobody wants to appear like a French Revolutionary guillotining the rich and saying that "Sanders is harsh and that is his brand" doesn't really help.
The only way you can get these "moderates" to support policies that benefit the working class is if they have no other choice to preserve their career. In order win the fights worth fighting (M4A, Tuition-Free College, Student Debt Relief, stopping endless wars, etc) you need to build power among the people and force these politicians to move toward your position or replace them with someone who will.  There is decades of evidence that proves you can't debate them or befriend them into doing the right thing if their money is coming from large corporations and the 1%. If you think there needs to be big structural change, it's not going to be achieved by a "grand bargain" with moderates and conservatives. It's going to be achieved using the strategy of FDR: rally the people and fight like hell, make a lot of enemies, and either crush those enemies or make them bend to your will.
Yeah.  No where on this thread has the 99% ever been brought up.  This is just about the billionaires.  Why is this so hard for you?
>Is there any candidate who doesn't have making the government start working for us again as part of their platform?  I don't like talking down other candidates, so I will stay pretty broad. Some candidates think there is a deeper problem in politics than others. Some want to focus on just going back to "the better times." They are less likely to pass legislation that will make lasting changes.  Warren has specific and concrete plans on how to improve the government and make it work for the people. People can say whatever they like on the campaign trail, but when you make an actionable plan, you prove that you have actually given it real thought.   >is she notably different on climate change from anyone else?  Jay Inslee had the best climate policy of any of the 23 candidates running for 2020. When he dropped out, Warren met up with him and got him to share his plans with her. She now incorporates and expands on Inslee's plans.  >If she is able to wipe out student loan debt, what happens to the next cohort of students going to private universities?  Wiping out the debt does nothing if we don't fix the system that made that debt. I 100% agree.  As for what she will specifically do, [she has a plan for that](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/affordable-higher-education). But  what she plans and what gets through Congress are going to be different things. Congress is the governmental body that writes new laws and passes them. She can push Congress, she can advice Congress, and she can share her plans with Congress. But ultimately, it will be changed before it gets passed.   Her plan is the closest we can get for now. So take a look at that, and see how you feel about it.
>the context into implying that Bernie is a punitive person when he just wants people to pay their fair share.  You and I see it differently then. That's fine. One would expect people to see things differently when they support different candidates.  I think Bernie **is** punitive towards billionaires because that is what he has said on debates. I trust him when he talks. That quote above was from a debate asking Warren about being "punitive" towards billionaires. She started answering with the "fair share" you referenced when Bernie cut her off saying "I Do."  And it is ok if you agree with Bernie on this. I would expect you to agree with him if you are a Bernie supporter. But he has said himself he has a problem with billionaires and thinks they should not exist.    In any event. Good luck out there. While we may disagree with the particulars, we all share the same goals.
> I don't like talking down other candidates  Don't let anyone else hear you say that, you might get banned from Reddit for breaking rule #1: demonize those you disagree with.  On strengthening democracy, I think her heart's in the right place, but I'm not sure I can call a plan actionable when it involves passing two constitutional amendments in one of the most polarized political climates ever.  On the environment, it seems like the main difference among dems is nuclear power, and I have to disagree with Warren there. #1 priority has to be carbon emissions, and categorically ruling out more nuclear power runs counter to that.  For education, the link you provided is the specific thing I was looking at when I said I couldn't figure out her stance on private universities. She talks about wiping out existing student loans, but what's the plan for the millions of students who enroll in private universities after the loan forgiveness?
> On strengthening democracy, I think her heart's in the right place, but I'm not sure I can call a plan actionable when it involves passing two constitutional amendments in one of the most polarized political climates ever.  That is the beauty of Warren over so many others. She has plans inside plans. Can't pass those plans? That's what her other plans are for. Can't pass even one bit of legislation because we failed to get 51 Democratic Senators and McConnell litterally does not let a single bill get through? She has a plan for that exclusivly through the executive branch.   If you think she can't get anything through, who do you think CAN get something through?   >On the environment, it seems like the main difference among dems is nuclear power, and I have to disagree with Warren there. #1 priority has to be carbon emissions, and categorically ruling out more nuclear power runs counter to that.  I can agree with you on that. I think nuclear is going to be incredibly necessary. But I relent on this subject because even the Democratic left can't agree on using it. If less than 25% of America is pro nuclear, how is a president supposed to get it passed through  a Congress largely controlled by a group who want to pass ZERO climate regulations?  Passing the best possible plan is the most important thing. Because having the best plan on paper is exactly as valuable as having the worst plan on paper, worthless.   > For education, the link you provided is the specific thing I was looking at when I said I couldn't figure out her stance on private universities.  Based on my reading of it, she does not distinguish between private and public. She just says "free 4 year, 2 year, tech, and trade school." The exact implementation is going to have to be decided when it is put in a bill. My expectation is that Universities will have the ability to apply to become fully funded by the Federal Government, but they will have to pass quality and cost standards. Not every University will be free, but everyone will have access to a free university.   I am not arguing any of this is going to be easy, quite the contrary. This is going to be incredibly difficult and we will NOT pass all of her plans in 4 years or even 8. But I firmly believe that the US, and the world, will be far better off after a Warren presidency. I believe she will do better with whatever Congress she is given, better than any of the other candidates.
Look who‚Äôs center stage . . .
How the debates have been scheduled for Warren, I think has been VERY beneficial for her.  The first debate was the first night so a lot of people wanted to check it out. She was in control of the stage whenever she spoke, primarily during the first half. If anyone stopped watching, it was most of when she spoke.  Next, she had a debate with Bernie. She and him could team up against the moderates (who were largely laughing stocks) while she could also differentiate herself with Bernie.  Now she's gonna be in center stage, RIGHT NEXT To BIDEN, with Bernie flanking him. She and Bernie can team up again, and she can go up against Biden alone and shine.  I'm VERY excited for things to come!!!
Can't wait for Warren and Sanders to bounce ideas back and forth while Biden's standing there thinking about how he's going to work with Republicans.
She'll be standing to the right of Biden, but she'll attack him from the left.
I kinda like how Biden is sandwiched between Warren and Sanders.  Also I hate some of the Warren bashing that goes on in r/sandersforpresident. I'm sure it's the minority, but I saw someone say that they're never Warren even if she won the nomination.  Like if someone prefers Sanders over Warren then I can respect that, but I don't understand how someone can be a Sanders supporter but also refuse to vote for Warren in the general.
They should do this Brady bunch style.
Amazing Yang is closer to the center than Beto haha. I love it.
I think this will be the moment that breaks Biden's lead. I initially predicted that he would probably get the nomination because of his name recognition, and Biden is the one candidate who is could slip in the polls by being in the spotlight (because he makes so many missteps). Being situated in the middle of Warren and Sanders, two of the sharpest candidates out there, will really highlight his deficiencies. Warren also kills it in debates, so I don't believe she'll have a difficult road to securing a pretty stable lead.
I really hope Bernie and Warren can continue to wreck the other candidates while making each other stronger. Let them build off each other and then see where the cards fall in the end between them.
Yeah but who can actually beat trump?  JK, ANY of them. Vote for who you like not who has the ‚Äúbest chance.‚Äù Polls are bullshit.
The debate stage that should have alwaya existed.
LIZ 2020!
I can't wait for another debate that scratches the surface of the shallow end.
I'm sad Gillibrand isn't there, but overall I'm glad the debates have finally been narrowed down to these candidates. All the "also-rans" were sucking up oxygen.
Beto fan here with Warren as my close second. This positioning is really favorable for her. The narrative is shutting out Bernie, and has already positioned her as Biden's biggest threat. With this kind of momentum, it feels to me like she has already started to chip away at Biden's establishment support. Good luck on the 12 everyone!
I'm in for another Bernie/Warren smackdown.
Look who's missing. Tulsi Gabbard.
Media needs to stop pushing Biden.  CNN is totally stanning him
I really don't like that every media outlet is pushing the Warren VS Biden narrative like this is some WWE wrestling event
The media is doing Bernie DIRTY but hey at least it‚Äôs Warren that it‚Äôs benefitting and not someone like Buttigieg or Harris.
[removed]
If Beto and Booker were swapped all the POC would be on one side.
[deleted]
This is precisely why I dislike the debates. They're not an honest discussion about benefits and detriments of policy, they're an ordeal to see who can hold their own in a shouting match. The position a candidate is standing at shouldn't matter, but unfortunately, it does.
I'm excited and a bit worried as well, I'm not gonna lie.  She's like the only one whose polls are rising and I think a lot of people are going to put her on the spot.
But my son would have died without Obamacare!!!!  While failing to point out that Beau Biden was AG of Delaware when he got sick.
It will be the best game of tennis since Wimbledon.
Nice
True, and stage right, so from their POV it‚Äôs left. ;-)
I was originally gonna be a little harsher, but I don't want to bring negativity in here.   I just gotta say that some of the Justice Dems and Bernie-or-bust diehards and their purity tests really get me down. I don't have the luxury of living in a deep blue state where a Dem will always be elected. I consider myself a social Democrat, M4A and the Green New Deal is a hill I'm willing to die on, I stan AOC.   But I turn out for moderates whenever they get to the general because even if I have disagreements, politics means messy coalitions. And I'll continue to pressure those Dems to take good positions after they're in office. That's doesn't make me less of a progressive. Until Justice Dems actually, y'know, win elections in the Midwest, they can keep their opinions about who's selling out.
The people who are Bernie or bust in a way that includes Warren are the sorts of folks who'd be either not voting or voting for the PSL (party for socialism & liberation) candidate had Sanders not ran. It's like how people vote for the Constitution party because Ted Cruz wasn't the nominee.
>Also I hate some of the Warren bashing that goes on in r/sandersforpresident. I'm sure it's the minority, but I saw someone say that they're never Warren even if she won the nomination.  As long as it's not too vocal or prevalent, I'm willing to let that shit slide. But if it keeps popping up, I'm willing to bet that's Russia trying to divide the electorate again. They did it in 2016, and Mueller testified they're still actively meddling. If it worked once it can work again.  I was a Sanders supporter, and still am, but I just couldn't understand the never Hillary people, until I heard that Russia had instigated that movement. Sure a few people I could see having that stance. But to become so vehemently against her when the other option was trump? Seemed unconscionable to me, yet look what happened, he won. They really messed with people's heads.
[deleted]
Some will never move away from the Bernie or Bust mindset.  Those people,  no matter their age, are children.
There are many more Bernie supporters with Liz as our enthusiastic #2 candidate.  Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have ranked choice/score/STAR or any other useful voting system in our primary, so I guess technically #2 doesn‚Äôt mean anything more than last place. But it could sure be important if this ends up being a brokered convention between moderates and progressives.  I for one would be delighted to vote for Warren. She‚Äôs my number 2, and there is an enormous gap from her to #3. Bernie and Warren tower over the competition.
Yeah it‚Äôs really frustrating, they‚Äôre trying so hard to make Warren seem like a Hillary, when in reality her and Bernie are on the same team. It‚Äôs ridiculous
That sub is toxic. Has been since around December 2015 / January 2016
They're trolls. Probably Russian.
their #4 post right now is a warren hit piece.   funny how they said they would never go as hard on warren as they did everybody else and here we are...
The vast majority of Sanders supporters also like Warren.  He does attract some wackier independents though.  Our voting system always comes down to a battle for the dumbest minds in our society, where propaganda is the most powerful.
I haven't seen that over there but that is ridiculous if it is happening. It made some sense when people wouldn't vote for Hillary, but not Warren if she wins? Bernie is my pick, but I will more than be happy to support Warren 100% if she moves on
I agree. I also hate some of the senile Bernie bashing that goes on here as well. I wish the people who are so polarizing in a primary would just fuck off.
That subreddit has been incredibly disappointing. Its moderators have been deleting well reasoned opinions in defense of Warren and labeling them as ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù or containing ‚Äúinformation which is not widely believed to be true.‚Äù  Of course, conspiracy theories about how the DNC pushed Warren‚Äôs campaign to steal support from Bernie and how she‚Äôs a republican sleeper agent never get deleted.
I'm 100% behind both Sanders and Warren, and would be thrilled to be able to vote for either in the general but I have to say I see more anti Sanders stuff at the top of comment threads here than anti Warren stuff at the top of threads on Sanders' sub.  I suspect both camps are being leveraged to create a chasm between the two supporters groups when no such gap need exist. Both are progressives fighting to correct the problems created by the current administration.
> Also I hate some of the Warren bashing that goes on in r/sandersforpresident.  Do yourself a favor and just stay away from that sub.  It's a really toxic community -- almost as bad as r/the_donald.  I was a Bernie supporter in 2016 and unsubscribed from there with a week.
I‚Äôm a Bernie supporter who will enthusiastically canvas, votebank and vote for Warren if she gets the nomination. Warren is the candidate many of us actually wanted in 2016.   On the Bernie or Busters: I agree with you that it can get a little intense, but I think there is a huge silent ‚Äúnever Bernie‚Äù contingent that isn‚Äôt as seen online. Lots of upper middle class coastal Hillary folks who still want to blame Bernie for the shock loss their candidate suffered in 2016. It‚Äôs visible in the ‚Äúwhich candidate would you never vote for‚Äù polls, iirc. So I think sometimes Bernie or Busters can have extremely reactionary responses to an ideologically and rhetorically similar candidate like Warren getting better mainstream coverage; it can feel like there are lots of people and vested interests who will do anything it takes to avoid Bernie, even take his closest political bedfellow. Hence the reactionary responses in our circles.   Hopefully, we can focus on consolidating power as progressives, and eventually rally behind one of the two to take the nomination. (TBH, I would extend the same to Biden in the general). Guess we all just gotta do our individual bit to ensure that primary beefing doesn‚Äôt cause irreparable divisions...
Pete is Bobby
You mean in a 3x3 grid? But there are 10 people...
He's one of the higher tier candidates as of now since he's been recently polling around the level of Pete in early primary states and consistently higher than Beto
Sucks for Beto though, as he was solid 5th place til this week.
> Polls are bullshit.  General election polls are this early in the race. Primary polls are ok, if you understand them more like a "snapshot" than a "prediction" and don't put too much faith into one particular poll.
>Polls are bullshit.  No.   Let's not support science only when it makes us feel good, and be anti-science when it doesn't.   Statistics are a valid, relevant, and extremely useful branch of mathematics in which PhDs spend years and years developing skills in to gather and interpret empirical data.   Don't dismiss that as bullshit. Some, many in fact, are quite accurate and reliable.
I agree with your main point, but not your reasoning. It is stupid to try to vote based on "electability" because electability is not a static thing - the electorate changes too much every election to be able to analyze electability except in hindsight. Trump was seen as the most unelectable candidate in decades, if not ever. Oops.
I'm not sure Biden can. So far it's probably only Warren or Bernie.
Um...err...TBH the_donnie been doing a pretty interesting job of beating himself the past couple of weeks...  :-)     <insert image: Germanic-style clock with bird that pops out at set intervals>  On a more positive note, I am 1000000000  <rests finger> 0000000000000000% not surprised Warren is upward and onward!   I got one of those Warren fans at one of her rallies a few weeks ago and I smile every time I see it!  :-)
>Beto fan here with Warren as my close second.  Can I ask you a couple of questions that is totally genuine and not meant as an attack on you or Beto without you being offended?  Why Beto still?  Do you think he will be able to recover from his low single digit polls when there are 3 candidates that are polling over 15%?  And what kind of cross over policies between Beto and Elizabeth Warren do you see?   I see them as center (for the Dem party) and left candidates though I could be wrong
Tom Steyer had a higher chance of meeting the polling requirements than she did, she just doesn't have the support
>Look who's missing. Tulsi Gabbard.  She's not missing.  She didn't qualify for the debate because of her low polling in DNC approved polls
No thank you media conspiracist.
[Actually, he was the most mentioned candidate in the news last week](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-presidential-candidate-was-mentioned-most-in-the-news-last-week-7/)  > Last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders was the most-mentioned candidate in online news. According to data from [Media Cloud](https://mediacloud.org/),[1](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democratic-presidential-candidate-was-mentioned-most-in-the-news-last-week-7/#fn-1) a database of online news stories, Sanders was mentioned in about 45 percent of online news stories that mentioned any 2020 Democratic hopeful, up 11 percentage points from the week prior. Some of that coverage focused on a series of proposals Sanders released last week on topics ranging from combating [climate change](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/climate/bernie-sanders-climate-change.html) to supporting [labor unions](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/21/20826661/bernie-sanders-union-plan-labor-worker-rights-2020) to reforming the [criminal justice system](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/19/20812138/bernie-sanders-criminal-justice-reform-plan-mass-incarceration): For example, 26 percent of online stories that mentioned Sanders also included the word ‚Äúclimate.‚Äù   And while Biden has definitely been getting a disproportional amount of Cable news coverage, the difference between Bernie and Warren's cable coverage isn't that huge of a gap ( 41.6%  for Biden, 22% for Warren, and  16.9  for Sanders this past week)
Can you not do this on this subreddit please? It‚Äôs super unproductive and only hurts people‚Äôs perception of Sanders.
No dividing Democrats, please.
Trump and the RNC raised $100 million last quarter. The most any Democrat raised was $24 million. Fixing the broken campaign finance system needs to be priority number one for any Democrat in office, but in order to do anything about it we need to actually win the election.
Has any candidate specifically pledged against certain kinds of fundraising for the general
The rules have been out for a while. She knew what she needed to do and she couldn‚Äôt get it done. Simple as that.
Agreed. Debates are a terrible way to evaluate candidates, because they don‚Äôt do anything to measure the actual qualities it would take to be a good or effective President. The modern debates are even worse. They‚Äôve turned into sporting events that reward and highlight conflict rather than showcasing the talent or the party, which is what they should be doing.  The best thing I can say about them is that they are viewed by a lot of people, so they provide an opportunity for less engaged people to learn a little about the candidates.  I‚Äôm a political junkie so I will still organize my life around them, I just wish they were a little bit more useful.
I hear you, but the performance aspect of the presidency is also very important. You need to be able to convince hundreds or millions of people to do what you want so you need to be able to be a commanding presence.  I just wish that presidents also were tested on the other aspects of being president, like the ability to understand complex topics and explain policy solutions.  I feel like to make it to the main stage there should be a winnowing of candidates where they‚Äôre tested on basic facts and like ... ability to do math. That would weed out so many charlatans.
[deleted]
I used to feel the same way, but I saw something on Twitter that changed my mind on this. The presidency can be a grueling job, with intense focus required for hours and hours. I agree the shouting match aspect is crap, but requiring them to hold it together and keep their cool in a multi-hour policy discussion is a pretty important test of a presidential hopeful's qualifications
She can handle it. I'm worried about a lot of other things but how she handles the pressure isn't one of them.
That's exactly what you should want. That's how you become President.
I‚Äôm wondering what will happen if she is asked about taking corporate money in the general election. Seems like a tricky subject.
That's great! Let's make it even better then.
Busting (for or against anyone) is a naive and painfully privileged stance.  To do that in 2016 could be possibly excused by inexperience, but with the last four years of evidence of the harm it causes, at this point it's simply abhorrent.
I said this before a single candidate announced their run: voting for they wining Dem *needs* to be the Russian troll bot litmus test. I would elect the Ebola virus over Trump.
Iono why would Russia divide the left...? Their goal historically and in America has always been destroy the center‚Äîdestroying the left helps the center. Occam's razor, man, Sanders has a lot to offer, but his Bros and staff have a serious toxicity problem.  Like you said, Russia "instigated" it, but it found a smooth landing. Like you said "they really messed with people's heads."
Lately it‚Äôs been ‚ÄúWarren is going to accept PAC money in the general so she‚Äôs corrupt and controlled by the DNC and Wall Street‚Äù   As if her entire campaign isn‚Äôt about eliminating corruption. As if she doesn‚Äôt already have dozens of different policies out about holding Wall Street accountable and eliminating corruption in government. As if she hasn‚Äôt been fighting against corporations for 20+ years. As if she didn‚Äôt essentially create the CFPB.
If you wanna really lose it check out /r/wayofthebern
That's what I don't get. I'm leaning towards Sanders in the primary. I love warren. A warren presidency gets me as excited as a Sanders presidency. Just a couple small things. But neither are enemies. Our biggest move is destroying Biden, kamala and all the moderates
> I'm in my local Warren volunteer community and I've never seen a single anti-Bernie post.  This isn't the reason I picked Warren this time, but it has absolutely been my favorite part about supporting Warren compared to Bernie in 2016.  I have really loved the communities.
Do yourself a favour and never watch Rising.
It‚Äôs incomprehensible. If you like Bernie‚Äôs positions, it‚Äôs not a huge leap to support Warren if she‚Äôs the nom.  I know in Nov 2020 I‚Äôm voting Blue No Matter Who.  Of course I hope it‚Äôs Liz, but I‚Äôd be happy with any of the remaining candidates save for Old  Joe.  But refusing to vote against this fascist orange shitstain just isn‚Äôt an option.
4 more years of Trump and the irreversible, catastrophic climate change it would set in stone may well be the end of us all, but at least they‚Äôll still have their *values*.
If Warren pulls ahead, Sanders will drop out, endorse her AND campaign for her.   Sanders is an issues candidate, not a personalities candidate, which is why he doesn't want Biden to be the nominee.   To be clear, I'll vote for Sanders if he gets nomination. If something should happen and Warren drops out, I'll support Sanders. But Warren has the sincerity and magnetism of a winner, and she's best qualified for the job.
theyre also the same people that insist nobody is actually bernie or bust.
They‚Äôre more likely just Russians
but the rest of the bernie crowd straight up refuses to admit that they have any responsibility for this. they brush it off by saying these crazies are troll....and then go on to parrot the trolls.
I think it‚Äôs honestly a minor thing that‚Äôs not representative of both of either camps, but we‚Äôre all more wary of it now remembering last time, which is probably a good thing overall.
Same. I‚Äôm active over there and this is literally the first post I‚Äôve ever come to here and it‚Äôs all shitting on online sanders supporters. Not giving me faith about any of what these people here are preaching tbh.
Likewise, I was banned from r/SandersForPresident after the primary for suggesting that Clinton would make a better president than Trump.
Klobuchar is clearly Alice
Yang is Cousin Oliver.
Unless he summons a miracle, Beto should be pulling after this debate imo. He‚Äôs not the one.
Yang is polling like 1% in every early state (While Pete is doing much better in IA and maybe a little better in NH than nationally), but has done pretty well in the last few national polls (which is what the debate positions were based on) which inched him just ahead of Beto.
Not quite. I wish this was the case but he‚Äôs polling around 3 percent 4 percent at absolute best nationally as of late while Pete is a bit higher at 5 percent. This does technically put him at 6th but closer to Booker and Beto than Pete.
General election polls are accurate too
A general election poll over 14 months out from the election is completely useless.
I agree with you, but people trot out polls about general election match ups and don't even mention how general election polls got it horribly wrong in 2016. Sure, when a poll says a candidate is 80% likely to win there's a 20% chance they'll loose, but given how systematically wrong all the polls got it in 2016, I'd think that journalists citing polls would want to at least attempt to assure readers that these new polls are factoring in whatever factors were missed last time around.  There are lots ways in which the 2016 election was different than others, but I'd say all the factors together added up to depressed enthusiasm for one candidate, which surely seems like something that could be measured and accounted for.   Anyway, I think there's reason for healthy skepticism of polls, especially after 2016, but agree that they're not total bullshit.
Ok but have you ever participated in a poll? I haven‚Äôt. I would but Ive never been asked. It‚Äôs such a small sample size. It‚Äôs completely random and only used to sway people.  It has nothing to do with science. Idk what you‚Äôre talking about. Soft science maybe but polls and chemistry are not the same lol. I‚Äôm not denying Climate change over here I‚Äôm simply saying polls don‚Äôt represent anything. They‚Äôre random and we don‚Äôt know where the data comes from or who these people are that are being polled.
Well he‚Äôs leading in the great omnipotent polls. Who are the people they‚Äôre polling? I haven‚Äôt met anyone that has ever participated in a poll.
Beto is a personal hero of mine. His campaign in my home state of Texas really struck a chord with me, and I really believe that he has the leadership skills to be a great president. Then El Paso happened, and the way he conducted himself in contrast with Trump really cemented where I stand. He obviously has an up-hill battle, but we have several months until the first caucus happens, and I think if some things break the right way for him and if he starts to resonate in debates/interviews that he could make a serious comeback. Would I bet money on it? No. Do I think he'll win Iowa or NH? No. But we have a loooooooong way to go.  I also acknowledge that Beto and Warren have contrasting policies (although that is made more evident since it's an all dem primary). However, I think they are both trying to get to the same place. Yes, Beto has Medicare for America while Warren has M4A, but at the end of the day they both want the right for high-quality public insurance for everyone. They just may get there in a different way. Beto supports the fight for raising minimum wage to a living wage, woman's right to choose, tackling climate change (net zero carbon emissions by 2050), ending reckless trade wars, etc. I find myself caught half-way between a "liberal" and progressive, and lots of both of the candidates' platforms appeal to me, so I would be thrilled to vote for either one.  The Beto2020 reddit has a lot of great people who are also optimistic about Warren as well who would love to engage with you guys over here! Swing by if you feel so inclined or want to learn about his platform! (:
Warren on impeachment: 'Every single person in Congress should be called on to vote'
We've had an impeachment vote recently brought by Al Green.  We know where they stand.  We know that 137 Democrats voted against impeachment.  Those folks need to be primaried in 2020
Ok say congress goes on the record, a few republicans will be shamed, but then what?  it‚Äôs not like they have a soul at this point. And what do we get? The senate rejecting impeachment procedures and trump using the win to fuel his candidacy. Idk what Liz is thinking but I‚Äôm with Pelosi on this one
Vote him out
I respect Liz so much for this. It's terrible that Dems are too spineless to pursue impeachment.
At the very least we need to know why they opposed the measure.
To be fair, those articles were without any investigation and didn‚Äôt include any obstruction charges (it was all about his racist remarks).   I won‚Äôt judge those who voted against that specific bill, I‚Äôll judge those who are against even opening a formal investigation.
I'm all for starting impeachment hearings, but jumping straight to impeachment a week before the Mueller hearing would have been insane (Like, what exactly do people think would have happened if every democrat had voted yes?  For a lot of the country that isn't paying that much attention, it would have have been out of the blue and looked insane, and they would just tune out even more.).  It was rightly voted down, and the idea that people who voted it down need to be primaried is so over the top and counterproductive to getting control of the government in 2020 that it frankly sounds like the sort of Dem-infighting agitation Russian psyops did in 2016.  &#x200B;  In an incredibly important election, you want to spend a ton of resources and political capital trying to remove half of the democratic delegation because they didn't vote yes on an ill-timed, poorly constructed impeachment vote?  That sure sounds like a republican operative's wet dream.
I live in WA-1, and my representative, Suzan Delbene, voted against impeachment. Her predecessor is WA governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee, who has spoken out in favor of impeachment. I do wonder if he would have voted for impeachment if he were still my rep.
No, don't spread hate and discord as it specifically works against our shared goals. There are many reasons one might vote no to impeachment on those specific grounds. Many might have wanted to wait until Muller finishes his testimony, others might want to wait for some other interview, or conclusion of a different investigation.  Some might think they can better control the narrative in its current state rather than if we had impeached earlier.  However, I do agree. It is time for impeachment. No more delays, no more excuses.
Exactly.  Let's burn down the whole Democratic party.  That will show the Republicans!
How sure are you the 2020 election will be free from foreign influence?   I'm not willing to bet on it
Yes, this is what we should be focused on.
Because Pelosi is worried it will doom moderate Dems to lose many of the newly gained seats from 2020. Democrats in red districts will likely lose if they vote to impeach, so Pelosi convinces the middle of the party to give them cover by tabling it.
Because impeachment would lead nowhere. Without any chance that the Senate would vote to convict, impeaching Trump would be nothing but political theater. That likely would not play to the Democrats' favor.
>I won‚Äôt judge those who voted against that specific bill  I agree with this sentiment, but its the only way we have to judge right now.  If this was the last time the House gets to vote on impeachment (which may be the case), I'm judging based on that in the primaries.  If there is another vote and a politician votes to continue the matter, I am willing to let this previous vote go
Frankly, I think that Al Green's resolution was likely the last time the House will get to vote on impeachment. and those that voted yes knew that.  Mueller finished yesterday and the House is about to go on a 6 week vacation.  Then it'll be "too close to the election"  So if this is a Reps only vote on impeachment, that's a permanent mark.  If there's a later one and they vote yes, that sort of "erases" the vote.  The fact that House Dems didn't start impeachment hearings on Jan 22, 2018 and haven't since then is why Al Green had to force this vote
>However, I do agree. It is time for impeachment. No more delays, no more excuses.  Everything you wrote above is contradicted by this correct statement
Those 137 Reps aren't Democrats.  Primary them and replace them with people that are
Impeachment won't work, from what I understand it needs something like 2/3 rds ? How may Republicans will vote to impeach him? None, that is why they are talking about more than anyone else. PS: not an expert here....
>Democrats in red districts will likely lose if they vote to impeach  That's the assumption but I think that assumption is wrong for the most part.
And that makes perfect sense.  No point losing the house to not remove Trump.
It's the right move. Impeachment might run into the election during a time where Dems are trying to gain voters. Such an action will make people dig in and rally harder than they otherwise might. Now if we lose 2020? All hands on deck for impeachment.
Benghazi and Email investigations were political theater and Republicans faced zero consequences for it.
Why would it not play to the Dems favor? Are you basing this off Clinton impeachment?
[removed]
You could be right but isn't "too close to the election" the whole point? Make sure the impeachment stuff isn't forgotten about by the time the election comes around?
I see no contradiction. It feels like you  are specifically trying to divide the Democratic base. Why? All it does is weaken their ability to actually do the thing we want them to do?  You advocate for removing over a hundred Democrats from office because they did not think that Impeaching Trump solely on racism was not a good idea? He has done SO much more than being racist. Why hobble the entire impeachment proceedings by forcing it to be so narrow?  It is time to impeach Trump, and we should impeach him for as many of his offences as we can. Picking the most egregious and least defendable crimes (probably including racism).
Clearly, Adam Schiff is just a republican in disguise.  Good grief.
I think you mean replace them with Republicans.  It is an interesting strategy.  Putin and McConnell would support it, I'm sure.
You‚Äôre absolutely right. However, wouldn‚Äôt the House have even more investigative powers than Mueller and they could actually make shit public? We only have 15 months left, it‚Äôs now or never
This is a terrible strategy.   Impeach now. Damn the consequences.
Trump will win the 2020 vote. The last two elections have been compromised, why in God's name are people acting like the next one won't be?
This comment has been overwritten.
Pursuing impeachment, an avenue that will definitely not result in conviction, will label the Dems as lame ducks who aren't doing anything to directly help the American people.

How does primarying a sitting Dem mean they will get replaced with a republican?  Most people have no clue who their rep is and just vote straight ticket
What does impeachment do that makes it so worth it? Against a system that already favors republicans, it‚Äôs better to wait and make sure Dems win in 2020
Agree, Dems look so weak right now. It's terrible.
Dem voters voted overwhelmingly in 2018 for a check on Trump. Does anyone feel like they are a check on Trump right now??
Not true. Republicans will primary their own when they go off the reservation.
Which doesn't matter when the Senate will block literally anything the Dem-majority House passes. In this situation you have to do both, legislate and show that Republicans have no interest in passing any meaningful new laws, AND push to impeach to get eyes glued to this disaster unfolding in front of us because it is the right thing to do and shouldn't be based on the politics of maybe looking bad.
I think if we let this shit slide it‚Äôs going to set a dangerous precedent. We have to nip this in the bud.
The thing is a lot of the country does align, or atleast think they align, with moderate viewpoints. You can‚Äôt just assume the rest of the country will just fall in line, the moderate dems are necessary because moderate dems exist in the country. And they matter! Yes they need to be led in the right direction, but they‚Äôre necessary to a functioning democracy (multiple viewpoints). Yes it‚Äôs ‚Äúright to center‚Äù of most of the world but we‚Äôre not most of the world, whether that‚Äôs good or bad it‚Äôs whatever because that‚Äôs a fact. Hopefully we move in the right direction but we can‚Äôt be so aaaaa salting the earth
You mean when they are reasonable?
I still don't get why someone hasn't brought a motion to remove mitch from the senate...
Sadly, I don't think precedent is as important as it was 3 years ago. Precedent used to mean something, but Trump has shown us that you can completely ignore it, and directly violate it, without consequences.  I am not against trying to hold on to some semblance of order, I am just no longer convinced precedents can be revived after this administration is gone.
Oh, I don't pretend to understand the mind of the GOP or its voting base. But if you don't tow the line (on say climate change) you get primaried. That was the Tea Party go-to tool for closing ranks and pushing politics to the right.  Admittedly, certain Democrats have started to flirt with that tool recently, but it's not on the same scale. The primary just doesn't have the same bite as a mechanism for accountability in the Democratic party.
"I lived in an America where abortions were illegal. If you had the means, you still had access to safe abortions. It was the most marginalized and vulnerable people who did not. We can never go back to that time." - Elizabeth Warren
I‚Äôm really happy that Warren is saying this so bluntly. Thank you!
While I appreciate that declaration, we‚Äôre already more than halfway back to that time. Ridiculous regulations, clinic closures and lack of coverage under insurance have made abortions prohibitively expensive for many‚Äîespecially when travel and overnight stay may be involved.
Elizabeth and her campaign have gotten ***so*** much better about using non-gendered language when it comes to reproductive rights and it seriously means so much to me. The switch is so simple and I feel like a lot of people won't notice, but I can tell she's been making a concerted effort to do better about this. It's something I wrote the campaign about several times and whether or not I had any part of it, I feel seen and I feel heard.
This is what people don‚Äôt get: Republicans don‚Äôt want to outlaw abortion, they want to outlaw abortion for anyone who isn‚Äôt them: wealthy rich white and powerful. Anytime their mistress gets knocked up they ‚Äúneed‚Äù an abortion for them. Unfortunately, they don‚Äôt have nearly the same empathy when it comes to other people.   Democrats want everyone to have the same rights so they want abortion to be accessible, Republicans want ‚Äòspecial exceptions‚Äô for themselves. Damn is it any wonder people think republicans don‚Äôt have any empathy??
One point I feel I need to make is that if these republicans were really pro life they would be up in arms about all the fertilized eggs that get ‚Äòkilled‚Äô at IVF clinics.  Wouldn‚Äôt it be more in line with their Christian values if they mandated those embryos to be gestated in artificial wombs?  But of course they wouldn‚Äôt do that because who would pay for it? Who would take care of the babies when they are fully developed? Republicans aren‚Äôt stupid, they know that if they push for ‚Äòlife at all costs‚Äô that means someone has to be responsible for those lives so who better to push that responsibility on than women?  This is exactly why they hate abortion but don‚Äôt support food stamps and government programs: they don‚Äôt like the idea of a ‚Äòlife being killed‚Äô but actually caring for that life is too expensive so they push that time and cost onto low income women who can‚Äôt afford it.
I personally don't like abortions at all, but pro-choice is the only sensible policy to have for a general populace.

Roe v. Wade probably won't make it through the end of the SCOTUS season
This is good to hear. I am entering healthcare, specifically reproductive care. I try to use word like "pregnant people" and "those with a uterus" . It has been an easy switch for me, and I hope it is validating and comforting to my future patients.
Eli5 why that‚Äôs important? Is it for transgendered folk? I figured reproductive rights were ultimately a women‚Äôs issue
[removed]
It‚Äôs not just abortions, it‚Äôs decent healthcare, good paying jobs, tax benefits, etc.   All of our society is geared towards improving life for the rich.
I am more and more convinced that anti-abortionists don't care about  fetus. They are motivated by their prejudices against women who have  abortions. They think these other women are murderers who want to have sex without responsibility.  If they or their loved ones need abortions, it is obviously fine with them. This is because they are always the responsible ones, so they are not "murderers who want to have sex without responsibility".  I  have no doubt that many anti-abortionists would be furious if their   babysitters are murderers, but I doubt any one of them would care if   their babysitters had abortions. This example demonstrates that many   anti-abortionists say things they don't believe in. Vilifying people is   an extreme form of prejudice.  This is also consistent with the view of many anti-abortionists about birth controls. Many of them simultaneously oppose to birth control and abortions. Their reason for opposing birth control? "women want to have sex without responsibility." Interestingly abstinence is a form of birth control. In proposing abstinence, they expose their concern is still about sex. Of course, many of them are OK with them using any form of birth controls. They are obviously the responsible one.  Research has found that many anti-abortionists are highly prejudiced people. They prejudices are so wide ranging that a researcher calls them "equal opportunity bigots". This also explains why many anti-abortionists are so supportive with the party who locks children in cage and other discriminatory policies. In their prejudiced mind, these people are criminals/lazy/undesired etc.  Research further found that even if a discriminatory policy targets them or their love ones, they still think that it only targets others and so they support the policy. By the time they realize they are hurt, it is already too late. This is how a prejudiced and self-righteous mind thinks.  Having said these, I want to emphasize that in general anti-abortionists are not malicious people (Their politicians, on the other hand, in general are malicious people.). Their prejudices are due to ignorance. Research found that they have remarkable capacity for change if they get to know more different people. They don't lack empathy in general. They can be as loving as everyone else.

I wouldn't bet that they wouldn't go after IVF clinics. They even went after women who get pregnant due to rapes and incest, when people point out the inconsistency of "pro-life" and exceptions.  To get around the cost, they can simply outlaw IVF or restrict IVF such that all fertilized eggs must be implanted or preserved or the doctors/clients would be prosecuted.
Totally Agree.   The Government should try and avoid mandating medical procedures, like pregnancy and birth, for moral reasons.  I really dislike abortions, but I dislike the government baning them even more.   For people like us, the best policy is better education and anti-poverty measures. People don't have an abortion as a plan A. So we can tackle the problems that lead to abortions.

Removed: Brigading
Ineffectiveness and the Fundamental Right to Privacy are good reasons to legalize abortion.  Opposing the will of the majority to ban something for religious reasons is *always* a bad idea.  Nothing that >30% of Americans think is acceptable should *ever* carry a criminal penalty.  I can think of zero exceptions to that statement.  Criminal law exists to punish and rectify anti-society behavior.  If society approves of a behavior, it's not the kind of thing that should be criminally illegal.
I‚Äôm not sure. While the ideological makeup of the court had changed, they are still supposed to be an impartial body of jurists. It would be a significant move to upend the principle of *stare decisis* and overturn Roe.
This is why I‚Äôm Blue no matter Who for the general. A good handful of Bernie or Bust people seem to be forgetting that if Trump gets one more Republican in the Supreme Court, it‚Äôs game over. No climate change action for the next generation.
SCOTUS reasonably needs to overturn Griswold v Connecticut for that to happen.  I think it's going to be a close vote, but I simply doubt SCOTUS is ballsy enough to overturn Griswold and reverse "Constitutional Right To Privacy" precedents across the board.  Fun fact, though.  Odds are pretty good that any decision that reverses Roe will *automatically* reverse Obergefell (gay marriage) and that'll be a world of hurt for us all.  They're both based on the same precedent.

Heya! It's important for trans/non binary folx. Reproductive rights aren't limited as a Women's Issue because one needn't be a woman to have a uterus. I am a non-binary person but I am still affected by repro rights decisions, just as many trans men are as well.  Using non gendered language is important anyway, so you're not erasing all of your supporters who may not identify as a man or a woman. Saying "people" instead of "men and women" acknowledges the existence of trans folx and is just good practice ‚ù§
Removed per Rules 4 and 11. Please don't promote other candidates and/or divide the Democratic party.
> I am more and more convinced that anti-abortionists don't care about fetus  I'm sure individual pro-life activists do.  I've known a lot of them (grew up in Catholic school).  But politically, Pro-life is never about the fetus.  They *know* that abortion restrictions in the US are more likely to make abortions unsafe than make them go away.  Planned Parenthood has led the march of education that reduced abortions to pre-Roe levels.  Bans are always less effective than facts.  Pro-life politicians want to remove the right to Privacy, which will give them free passes to contraceptives and gay marriage.  They want to punish "sinners", and overturning Griswold lets them.
Just because not everyone is like this doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt people out there who are hypocrites. Also how much you wanna bet those evangelical Christians would still vote for a Republican who made their mistress have an abortion?  Also FYI I was raised Republican and Christian in NY (specifically LI which is more Republican than NYC) so I know all too well what those bubbles are like. I prefer secular California where you can do whatever the hell you want (legally) without the morality police jumping on your back.
IVF clinics are for the rich, they won't go after them.
Yes, exactly. Well said.
And if we're being brutally honest about it, it's not like Republicans want to lose the boogeyman of *Roe* for their fundraising in evangelical areas.
All that has to happen is a shift from the question of a right to privacy to a question of if the unborn are human persons with rights. Once rights are granted to the unborn, there will be severe restrictions on legal abortion.
Yea I just don't understand how people could be so short sided to the point of they will only vote for one candidate period. Like, if you're a Bernie fan, Warren would be a hell of a consolation price if she were to end up as the nominee over him. Even Biden, though certainly not an ideal candidate, would be miles better than Trump.
Fun story, 1) I already had cancer so you can‚Äôt pull that bullshit 2) warren isn‚Äôt my candidate, I was simply commenting. I support Sanders. So.   They/them and affirming pronouns are incredibly important to those who it matters. Please don‚Äôt be so ugly.
Exactly what I needed to know. Thank you!   Sorry, I was a young homophobe/transphobe/general bigot around 2016 and I‚Äôve had a lot of learning and catch up to do as I align myself with progressives these past few years lol.
I disagree with you.  In general, it is the anti-abortion voters who are like what I described. They have ignorance based prejudices, fears and self-righteousness. They think they are in this for moral. Indeed, they think they are far more righteous than most, even though by their standards, they sin as much as average people. In other word, their moral is not high, but their sense of moral superiority is super high.  In general, the anti-abortion politicians have malice based prejudices. They are manipulative and power hungry. Yes, they speak their supporters language. They like the votes. They are in this for themselves.
In many red states, I bet they would go after them, just like they did for all abortion clinics and they did for rapes and incest victims. In many blue states, I don't think they can go after them at state level since they don't have enough political power. I wouldn't bet that they wouldn't do so at federal level.  I think it would be a mistake to understand the Republican Party politicians as pro-rich. They are pro their rich friends/donors. They will always find ways to give them get-out-of-jail cards even if it violates the laws. I doubt their rich friends/donors will need it though. They can go oversea to get abortions if they are not available in US, or just pay off people to carry the pregnancies and raise the babies.
Wow that's a good point I never thought of. If Row is overturned and abortion becomes illegal, how do they rile up their base?  But I suppose it would become "vote for us to keep saving babies"
An excellent point. Overturning Roe v Wade puts them on the defensive and gives the Left the opportunity to attack. Plus it might actually wake up a few passive white female voters.
Here's the problem with that mindset.  They already lost the Pro Life battle, and they know it.  If Roe is overturned, most states will still keep abortion legal... And there's significant defensible Constitutional challenges to "leaving the state to get a legal abortion elsewhere is a felony" since those types of laws simply do not seem viable.  Nothing will change about the Pro Life movement (except extra vigor) if they manage to end the Fundamental Right to Privacy.  There will always be a boogeyman.  It'll always be just one election away for them... Because we'll never have an Amendment that bans abortion.  In the unlikely event they manage a federal abortion ban, it will be repealed DAY ONE, with automatic blanket pardons, any and every time the Democrats get a majority of both the House and Senate.  Only one side can actually win the abortion war, ever, and it's the Pro-Choice side.  So all the Pro-life side needs to do to stay relevant is not quit.
Granting a fetus the rights of a person creates a whole host of bioethical and legal problems, as jurisdictions which have tried to do that have found out.
Absolutely! Glad to hear you're catching up! It can be an often uncomfortable process as you not only begin to question yourself, but come to terms with how views you previously held have hurt people. It can feel like a lot sometimes, but keep at it! :)
Perhaps my view is painted.  I live in a traditionally Blue area, and watched a LOT of people involved in Pro-life marches.  They didn't want Democrats to start losing, they just wanted Democrats to be pro-life too.  They didn't march out of prejudice against the poor.  I'm sure they had their share of self-righteousness with actual Nuns leading the march... but they did it honestly believing they could make a difference.  They didn't realize they were just pawns...   But again, politically, it's different.  When you look at actual pro-life leaders who have spent serious time on it, they know the stakes and the odds.  They're never going to stop abortions, and they know it.  They have an agenda that involves punishing "sinners" of a certain type of sin, and they frankly *are not planning to stop with abortion*.  The actual pro-life leaders know that they're really fighting to overturn the "Fundamental Right to Privacy", and the typical voter *does not*.  But beyond a couple technicalities and your post opening with "I disagree", I think we're on the same page.
I was once pro-life. I understand them too well. The cruelty is the point. In GA, black women die in birth at 4X the rate of white women and they are working to make more restrictive laws.   The people may believe they are pro-life, politicians know how to get their abortions.
Yeah it would be "keep voting for us so that we can keep installing judges that will make sure we don't have a NEW Roe (whatever that would be) come into practice."
Even their current attempts appear to have been enough to get a certain amount of white women off their asses and voting along with the black women that have generally formed one of the bulwarks of voting against anti-choice laws.
That is a really good point.
2020:  >Granting a fetus the rights of a person creates a whole host of bioethical and legal problems, as jurisdictions which have tried to do that have found out.  1860:  >Granting a negro the rights of a person creates a whole host of bioethical and legal problems, as jurisdictions which have tried to do that have found out.  A southern apologist told me a few weeks ago that slavery was like holding a wolf by the ears. It isn't a good idea, but once you are in the situation, you just can't let go.  I feel like these southern apologists have a lot in common with the pro-choice movement of today. They look at all the problems that are caused by recognizing the humanity of the unborn but overlook the most important issue of all: There is a human life, worthy of value, that has been made into a commodity and whose value is determined entirely by how much another person wants that person.  Yes, the legal scene becomes more difficult once you recognize the inherent value of the unborn person, but that is no excuse to deny anyone their humanity.
I see what you mean.  For voters, I think we are talking about two different groups of people. I am talking about the evangelicals who form the core base of Republican Party. They are the sources of power for most anti-abortion politicians.  For politicians, I am talking about the Republican politicians and the evangelical pastors. I think they do plan to stop abortions. This is what motivate their base. And the real origin of anti-abortion is not oppositions from evangelical mass either. The real origin of anti-abortion is that evangelical pastors were highly opposed to laws which prohibit them from running segregated schools and remaining tax exempt.  If you are interested, I can provide sources to back up all my claims.
I think we are in agreement.  One thing l learned is that many anti-abortion voters are not driven by compassion toward the fetus but by prejudices (as you said cruelty is the point). There is two sides of the coin of prejudices. On the one side, they are harsh toward their prejudiced targets. On the other side, they adore people on their sides. They make all sort of justifications/rationalizations for their loved ones, their leaders etc. Trump can have all abortions he want and they wouldn't abandon him.
One of my biggest frustrations living in suburbia are white women who actively vote against their own self-interest and just roll with whatever their hubby wants. In our house it's an open discussion on all candidates and issues so we vote as a (small, 2-person) block. I've come across so many women who are so passive about their vote. Maybe after 3 years of Trump, they'll wake up and get involved (or at least informed).
There are two dimensions to the Abortion Debate.   Dimension one:  At what point does sex cells become a person? Few call a woman's period "an abortion" of her unfertilized egg, and fewer still call all the sperm cells that never make it to an egg the death of a person. The first instance of the egg and sperm is the earliest I have heard people try and claim person hood over the cells. But about half of all zygotes don't actually implant and are lost. That is an awful lot of humans dying to a pretty standard system. You now get stuck outlawing fertilization clinics which attempt to implant multiple zygotes in hopes that one takes.  This view also leaves no room for allowing people to abort if they were raped, or raped by family. So it mandates 13 year old girls to hold a child to term after being raped by their father. It forces people to risk their lives if the pregnancy is progressing in a very unhealthy way and may lead to the death of the mother and child.   It is difficult to hold that a zygote is a person, but not impossible.  Second Dimension:  What can the government force a person to do in order to save another person's life? Pregnancy is dangerous. It is expensive, time consuming, and you may not make it through alive.   If you can be required to hold a child to term, what other medical procedures can be mandated by the state? People don't actually need both Kidneys or livers. Can the government mandate you donate those organs? What about bone marrow? That is even easier to donate and leads to curing diseases that can be cured no other way.   Or even the smallest medical procedure that saves hundreds of thousands of lives and holds almost zero risk for the donor. Blood donation. Should that be mandatory as well? What are the penalties for breaking this law? Abortion is being treated like murder, would missing too many Blood Donation appointments put you away for murder?  My take:  I fully agree with the idea that abortion is pretty bad. I *really* don't like it. But a persons ability to decide what medical procedures they are allowed to have and what they are allowed to avoid, is something I think needs a VERY compelling reason to take away from people.   I don't think we can legalize abortion. But we *may* be able to make it largely unnecessary with education, childcare, and anti-poverty measures. Warren has the best policies for doing those things.
Trying to draw comparisons between a fetus and an already-living, breathing, born human is quite frankly absurd for a laundry list of scientific and moral reasons.  Also the wolf thing is from a Thomas Jefferson quote about slavery.
I can see that.  There's simply no evangelical presence around me.  The pro-life around me are most dangerous because they should be voting "blue no matter what" and are starting to get shakier over it.  Other than vote manipulation, I think pro-life-Catholics are one of the biggest risks in the country to the Blue balance.  I agree with all your sources, and know you're talking truth... it's just not the angle of pro-life I've seen.  And people forget that non-politically, Catholics started getting VERY pro-life in the 1800s.  The political side to it is newer.
Unfortunately, the opposite has been true for a relative of mine. She's been getting more and more conservative over the last couple of years because of the people and information she's had around her and it's sad to see her sliding away from being a low-information voter to being a single-issue voter (which unfortunately is abortion/abortion rights).
> If you can be required to hold a child to term, what other medical procedures can be mandated by the state?  Ethically, there is a big difference between prohibiting someone from doing something and compelling them to some action. Here, we are just asking the state to enforce a prohibition against murder. Not allowing someone to do something is not the same as requiring them to do something.  The arguments about pregnancy and death are less potent than ever because it is no  longer common for pregnancy to result in death. If there was a reasonable expectation that a pregnancy would result in death, most of the country would support laws allowing medical action taken with the intended result of saving mom's life. Even the Catholic Church recognizes as much in ectopic pregnancies. The procedure is never intended to kill, it is just an unhappy byproduct of a procedure that will save a woman's life.  > I don't think we can legalize abortion. But we may be able to make it largely unnecessary with education, childcare, and anti-poverty measures.  Yes, providing better resources will certainly help. But I also think we need a culture change. We need to put less focus on "getting ahead." So many women have abortions because it'll get in their way of a career, of college life, or of some other ambition. If we valued having families more, the percent of pregnancies that are "unwanted" would drop quite considerably. Men would be more likely to take responsibility for their child and women would be more happy to carry her baby to term.
I thought about what would a compassionate person do in term of voting. First, the person would seek to understand why women have abortions. He/she wouldn't be quick to judge without hearing from the women. If we ask the women who have abortions, over 75% of them cite cost as the reason, i.e.  * Inability to afford raising a child * Impact to career development  If he/she wants to reduce abortions, the potential policies can be:  * High quality, availability and affordable child healthcare, daycare and education * High quality, availability and affordable maternity healthcare * Paid maternity leave * Strong maternity job protection  Sadly, many anti-abortionists are not compassionate people. This is reflected from the politicians and the policies and the slogans they are behind.  To bring us back to this sub of Warren. I think Warren is a compassionate person. Elizabeth  grew up in the south and has two brothers who are Republicans. Like  many Republican voters, they have wrong default opinions about people.  In her case, before she researched on bankruptcy, she couldn't find any  scientific studies on why people went bankruptcy. Since she grew up with  her dad getting very sick and her mom working minimum wage jobs  supporting the family, she thought that if her mom could work hard to  raise a family without going bankrupt, most people filing for bankruptcy  must be lazy. Once she started researching, she realized how wrong she  was: 1) Most people in bankruptcy are as hard working as her mom. 2)  there is no longer minimum wage job which can raise a family. This led  her to change her mind and join Democrats in fighting against  corruption.  There is more detail [here](https://www.vogue.com/article/elizabeth-warren-presidential-campaign-journey). Here is a quote from the article:  >Her  change of views seems to have come about for simple reasons: In the   ‚Äô80s, she and colleagues went out into the field as researchers and   started hearing from families in bankruptcy court. Warren had thought   that she would find people who were bad with money or who were trying to   shirk responsibilities. But she found that 90 percent of bankruptcies   were due to a cataclysmic expense‚Äîan unexpected medical bill, a job   loss, a divorce‚Äîand most of the people had been living   responsible-seeming lives.   The  revelation that middle-class families can‚Äîand increasingly do‚Äî-fail   while doing everything right seems to have moved mountains for Warren.   She notes that after her father‚Äôs heart attack, her mother could support   the family with a minimum-wage job. Today, she says, a family can‚Äôt   live off a full-time minimum-wage income, but ultra-rich people are   becoming ultra-richer for reasons that have little to do with the work   that they put in.
I'm sorry to hear that. :( On the bright side, in the past few years my mom has moved away from being a single-issue voter (on abortion) to being a fairly well informed voter. She's even changed for voter registration to Dem so she can vote in the primaries this year.
Did you have anything to do with her shift back? Or has she told you what in particular made her mentality shift?
Elizabeth supporting the UAW strike on Solidarity Sunday
I was there! I wish she had stayed a little longer or had given an offical speech, but I understand she's busy! I felt bad for her since everyone was swarming around her lol
Liz looks like she‚Äôs just out there having so much fun every day.
But I heard she was a corporatist! She must have been there to bust up the unions.  /s
This strike kind of makes me feel bad for owning a GM car
That's a really strong Kara Swisher vibe right there.
[removed]
Yeah same. The crowd was great. It was really crazy to see people swarming her like that!
she was going clyburn's wife, emily clyburn's funeral, which is understandable
Keep up the good fight!
Man, imagine if Biden did the same thing, despite him typically being pretty pro-union.
Don‚Äôt be!  Buying union-made products and services is the best way to help the labor movement for two huge reasons.  First, it means more good-paying union jobs, plain and simple.  You certainly don‚Äôt help the GM workers by purchasing foreign-owned non-union cars, because that reduces demand for union-made cars and results in more layoffs.  Second, the more successful the company is the easier it is for unions to share in its success. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve negotiated contracts in boom and bust times, and the employer never gives workers raises and more benefits out of generosity.  But contracts negotiated in boom times can get more for the workers - in tough times, you simply can‚Äôt get money for your workers that simply isn‚Äôt there.  That‚Äôs what this strike is about.  The workers saved GM by giving up a LOT.  Today, GM is making tons of money but doesn‚Äôt want to give back the things that the workers gave up to save the company in the first place.  So keep buying union-made products unless the union calls upon people to boycott.  In which case, you make damn sure to not buy the boycotted product until the labor dispute is resolved.  Source: me, a former union organizer, current union activist.
That's not necessary friend. If you own a GM car it was likely made by a union members. Don't feel bad, just continue to support labor rights for all.
Why? Union labor made it

Mark Zuckerberg saying not to vote for Elizabeth Warren is the best possible endorsement I can imagine.  Were I on the fence for 1/2 preference for Bernie and Liz, this would push me over to Warren.
[Her Twitter response was fantastic](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1179023352742236160)  >What would really ‚Äúsuck‚Äù is if we don‚Äôt fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.
Hope they record it for voter intimidation in the general.
It's afraid.
It‚Äôs like these lunatics are trying to cut ads for Warren. They‚Äôre terrified of her, and for good reason.
We thought it was scary when outside forces used Facebook to mold political opinion - maybe now we have to worry when Facebook directly decides to mold that opinion themselves.  What's to stop them from quietly burying pro-Warren posts and memes and quietly boosting ones attacking her?
"the billionaires love Warren so we can't trust her"  Every billionaire:
This just in: monopolies don't like getting broken up.  Tough luck, Zuck.
Hmmm... so this is why Zuck was so lenient on russian bots huh... ü§î
The only person in my life that uses FB is my mom
["Oh, what *dreadful* news for the campaign"](https://assets.rbl.ms/17691050/origin.gif)
It's not *that* damning, at least not in a "OMG Elizabeth Warren is an evil she-beast who will eat your children!" way. Of course Zuckerberg, with Facebook being in the crosshairs, is going to have a negative opinion. A pretty expected response really.
Side note: that site was an awful mobile user experience. I just want to scroll like a normal human!
In case you needed another reason to vote Liz, that‚Äôs it right there.
if they really hate warren they shouldn't say it outloud b/c it's just helping her case and her campaign hahaha. Wow.   hello ads  "bank executives/ceos who robbed the poor don't want you to vote for warren"....etc is just perfect messaging
far-right: "wtf I love facebook now?"
[deleted]
The Zuck anti endorsement endorsement.
!WarrenPlanBot internet  Internet companies usually donate a _lot_ to the DNC, so I don't know how this will affect the next election.
Warren‚Äôs campaign slogan should just be ‚ÄúLook At The People I‚Äôm Pissing Off!‚Äù Every time some public figure goes on a tirade against her, it‚Äôs invariably someone who I absolutely do NOT want anywhere near the Oval Office
Exactly why I am not on FB. He knows Warren will crack down on the fact FB is essentially stealing identities and more...
Is the Sanders fabase going to say this is a false flag to make sure their preferred "centrist" beats him?
Another *mark* against facebook...
Can we just lug the Guillotines out and get this thing over with? Zuck was so 00‚Äôs ugh

You'd think tech companies would best understand that everyone is listening and watching.
A quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt:  >We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace--business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.  >They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.  >Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me--and I welcome their hatred.
Stay off Zuckbook and InstaZuck.   Or you‚Äôll get  *ucked.
Is there anything that makes you want to vote for Warren more than the fact that Zuckerfuck hates her? That's right up there with Trump calling Bernie names.
Tbh nothing here is really all that incriminating, of course there going to resist there company being taken apart, and I'm not sure if he's wrong on how breaking up the companies will necessarily solve the foundations problems with a lot of social media.
He's stammering out of fear.  Facebook collects our data and then sells that data to other companies. In a time where data has become currency they have become entirely too powerful.  They went so far as to sell that data to the Russians so they could help influence our Presidential election.  Seems maybe one of Trump and Putin's under-the-table deals was for a Presidency, which Zuckerberg helped facilitate.  Zuckerberg doesn't have anyone's best interest in mind.  Team Warren all the way.
Lmao get fucked Zuck
Tech bro in chief is scared.
Zuckerberg just proving her point here about corporate irresponsibility. Facebook‚Äôs strategy has been to gain a monopoly in social media advertising. It‚Äôs virtually impossible to compete with them, which is why Snapchat has been struggling, and they‚Äôre the only real competitor. This is a failed marketplace due to facebook‚Äôs corporate (and political) power.
She should run commercials with this.  Literally.  "Mark Zuckerberg says that Elizabeth Warren would hurt the billionaire class. I agree.  I'm Elizabeth Warren and I support this message."
this is effectively what it did for me
Seriously, I've been concerned lately about how much the media seems to love her, and this honestly renews my faith. If Zuckerberg hates her, then she must be good for me regardless of the media.
I think it's more about who Zuck perceives as doing well in the race at the moment than it is about him thinking Bernie is representing his interests.
>"You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies ... if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don‚Äôt want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone‚Äôs going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight."  He obviously thinks an Elizabeth Warren presidency would be bad for his company but saying that he is telling his employees to not vote for her is a big stretch. And yes, if you're the CEO of a company that is asked about a candidate that wants to break up your company, you're obviously not going to say "yeah man, she is right". She is bad news for his company and the employees... color me surprised that the CEO in a company-wide AMA says that he doesn't believe in her policies.
True, but he also controls perhaps the most significant delivery of information (facebook and instagram). This is dangerous and those companies need to be monitored for putting their thumb on the scale.  That also somewhat underscores why they need to be broken up and regulated.
He didn't say not to vote for Warren, he said that they were going start a legal battle  if warren decides to go through with the whole breaking up tech companies thing, which is to be expected.
Why? Seriously why? This is the singular opinion of a billionaire.
The tweet she was responding to has been deleted.  Does anyone know what it said?
>Hope they record it for voter intimidation in the general.  Asshats like Mark Zuckerberg are the reason why Democrats have continued to nominate centrist candidates.  Now they're trying to ruin the campaigns of 2 incredible progressives
someone made a good point, he no incentive to stop right wing/foreign information manipulation to make it fair if it hurts the dems.
Indeed, the curtain hath blown open wider than usual.
"I'm sure all of my employees care as deeply about my wealth as I do and would never sympathize with someone trying to create a more fair tech ecosystem."
I have noticed that even though she's polling much higher now than she was, and has more name recognition, her posts have gotten far less "likes" than they used to. Look at posts from her "Elizabeth Warren" Facebook page from, say, 2014. Hundreds of thousands of "likes." Now, a few thousand.
> What's to stop them from quietly burying pro-Warren posts and memes and quietly boosting ones attacking her?  Facebook is a huge company and something like this couldn't be accomplished without a lot of employees participating.  There are almost certainly at least a few Warren supporters working at Facebook and these efforts would almost certainly leak to the media.
They need to understand _why_ Billionaires donate to them. Major corporations donated to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders _to try and change their minds_.   Both candidates ignore them, as I give an example here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/dbssrh/in_leaked_audio_mark_zuckerberg_rallies_facebook/f24iz31/
Political pages are still slammed with bot and troll comments. It's not as bad as Twitter, but it's still awful.
Keep in mind Instagram and WhatsApp are also Facebook.
Facebook is useful for groups and planning stuff. Only social media I use and not even that much
Love that gif! What was it in response to?
It was so bad I couldn't see the comment section (if there was one)  I am glad to be spared that
Pretty sure they've always loved Facebook, or at least it seems like it's their main demographic.
They love Pete because he's a technocrat and won't change anything about their business.
I find it kind of mind-boggling that people are still throwing that kind of money his way even when his polling has flat-lined since spring. I guess $2,800 isn't anything to these people, but still, seems like a [money pit.](https://politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/12/pete-buttigieg-fundraising-money-pit-228066) Aren't these people supposed to be smart investors?

I've already seen multiple twitter comments suggesting this, so yes.
Zuck is more worried about Warren right now because she's more likely to win.  I suspect he would be just as worried about Sanders if he was looking like a possible frontrunner.
Ridiculous of you to say. I‚Äôm a bernie supporter and any elite being scared of a candidate is great. I‚Äôd be okay with Warren although i don‚Äôt like how she voted for trumps military budget, no candidate is perfect.
Good grief..
Wasn't Snapchat whole premise about sending nudes but then they pivoted and now it's like it doesn't know what it wants to be? At least Facebook is still about social networking.
Very FDR ‚ÄúI welcome their hatred.‚Äù Love it.
>Seriously, I've been concerned lately about how much the media seems to love her, and this honestly renews my faith. If Zuckerberg hates her, then she must be good for me regardless of the media.  As much as I despise the media, I honestly think that they're far more interested in ratings/clicks than suppressing a progressive candidate. Right now Warren is hot.  Not quite Obama level hot, but she's driving traffic
>I think it's more about who Zuck perceives as doing well in the race at the moment than it is about him thinking Bernie is representing his interest  Oh no, I certainly didn't mean to imply that Bernie was pro-Zuckerberg.
Is Bernie campaigning on breaking up Facebook?  I know a few people who support Bernie over Warren specifically because he doesn't support breaking up Facebook and Amazon.
>That also somewhat underscores why they need to be broken up and regulated.  Zuckerberg just proved to Warren that FB needs to be given the Ma Bell treatment
Facebook knowingly subverted American and UK democracy by running election ads funded by foreign accounts.  Facebook gave our data to Cambridge Analytica which was a violation of even their own lackluster privacy polities.  He's our enemy.  I'm already Pro-Warren, but like Senators Sanders and Warren are so close policy wise it doesn't take much to go from S1/W2 or S2/W1 or vice versa
From my recollection it was basically just responding to this quote from the article  >"You have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies ... if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don‚Äôt want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. ... But look, at the end of the day, if someone‚Äôs going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight."
Does Zuck count as a liberal at all?
Don't call other Democrats names.  This isn't a war with people inside the party.  Some groups may never be enthusiastic about Warren, but they're still allies in the bigger fight.
I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked at all to learn that Facebook is burying content from politicians they don‚Äôt like.    On the other hand, there‚Äôs been a big shift away from users being exposed to organic content from companies and organizations, in order to push them to pay for advertising.   In 2014, organizations could reliably produce good content and have it show up for their users on FB.  Today, it‚Äôs almost entirely pay to play.
Part of that may be that there aren‚Äôt as many of the same people active on Facebook now as in 2014. I used to be a regular frequent user. Now I barely go there. Uninstalled it from my phone in spring 2016 because I got sick of irritating conversations from the same handful of people. I used to like a lot of progressive stuff.
That doesn't need any people. An automated algorithm that just keeps anything with her name further down the page requires no oversight and could be designed generally to promote and suppress content. They just needed to create one algorithm to manipulate the feeds, which they openly talk about doing. Only one person needs to add a setting for Warren and that one person could be Zuck.  This is why I don't have Facebook anymore.
Also, Warren's two billionaire donors were the wives of a businessman and an heir, and their husbands didn't donate.  Maybe, just maybe, rich women are like lots of other women and would like to support a woman with a viable chance at becoming president.
I thought it was hilarious when the "delete Facebook" movement took off how often I would see people saying they were done with Facebook and were moving to Instagram now.  This is exactly the problem.  As soon as any social media starts to take business from Facebook, Facebook just buys them.    This is exactly what anti-competitive laws were designed to stop by Facebook avoids those because it makes money via ads instead of directly charging consumers.  We desperately need to change those laws and break up companies like Facebook.
you are saying this on Reddit
> Only social media I use and not even that much  Reddit is social media.
Uh... do you mean "what she was originally laughing about?", or did you not realize it was a response in context, along with my text, to the story described in the headline? If the former, I don't know.
Good Bot!
It wasn't as black and white as some supporters of other candidates are making it out to be. They both just had different strategies on how to accomplish things.   Warren was able to secure a number of amendments, including provisions for service members such as pay raises for the military, protection from debt collection, and easier access to student loans.   I know there are a lot of reasons to be against the bill, but she voted for it to get something good attached to a bill that passed nearly unanimous 56 years in a row.   Bernie voted against it out of principal, and I can respect it. Warren  just saw it as an opportunity to do some good with it. And in my opinion, that was the better choice to make.
My job here is done!
Didn't she have the same response to Wall Street Dems threatening to back trump if she gets the nomination?
This is how I see it. They're gonna cover whatever gives them views regardless, and they still cover Biden WAYYYYY more than they cover Liz so the conspiracy theory that the media is pushing her is kind of ridiculous.
I'm confident that Sanders would be a huge thorn in Zuckerberg's side, but to be fair Warren directly said she's going to break up Facebook so obviously he's gonna come at her
This was the first result for "does Bernie support breaking up Facebook":  [Bernie Sanders says he would ‚Äòabsolutely‚Äô try to break up Facebook, Google, Amazon](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/bernie-sanders-facebook-google-amazon-1416786)
Warren is backing down on Medicare for All. A public option is doomed to fail when insurance companies cut coverage once a patient is no longer profitable forcing them on to the public option. Insurance companies will take all the profits from someone for decades and then when that person gets cancer or something just drop them leaving the public option to pick up the bill for someone who has never paid into it. If they continue to exist they‚Äôll also lobby and bribe politicians to kneecap the public option until it collapses, then use that as proof the public option doesn‚Äôt work. You should be pressing her on this not basing your decision on what ‚Äúleaked‚Äù audio of one rich person says.
> existential  I feel like this shows a lack of perspective in his life. Maybe that's a low blow, but man, wait till he finds out people lose their jobs over *merging* companies all the time.... or someone tell him about *climate* change.
>Does Zuck count as a liberal at all?  He was mulling a run for 2020 as a Democrat.  Hard to label someone as a liberal because there are so many different definitions of it
I agree that calling other Democrats names isn't right, but how on earth is Mark Zuckerberg an ally in any way?
It's very clear that you are not a software engineer.  A change like this would be massive and would require the involvement of a bunch of engineers.
Hmm. I always thought social media was reserved for ones where you use a legit identity. Good to know   Does that mean early internet message boards/forums were social media too? What is the exact definition here
Yeah, I meant what she was originally laughing about it. Sorry for the confusion.
538 releases a once a weekish report on how much TV time the candidates are getting.  Pretty simple to debunk that bullshit with facts  [https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/media/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/media/)
Care to share some evidence of Warren backing down on M4A?
Omg i didn‚Äôt know that... imaging a president Zuckerberg. Terrifying.
Fuck that guy, but "limousine liberals" sounds like it applies to any wealthy Democrat.
Elizabeth Warren is the only presidential candidate to earn an A on the new Indivisible scorecard.
>Day-One Democracy Agenda:   >   >Senator Elizabeth Warren received the top score in this section as she has proposed a set of transformative, structural reforms to our democracy that would put power back into the hands of Americans. Those reforms include support for DC statehood and court reform, in addition to support for campaign finance reform, voting rights, and anti-corruption reforms. Sen. Warren has also firmly committed to making her democracy agenda her top legislative priority if elected. Sen. Warren supports eliminating the filibuster in order to enact her progressive vision.   Well, Indivisible and I certainly see eye-to-eye on this.
This is great. Warren may have lost some fair weather fans this fall, but her strong support from the most engaged and active Democrats and progressives is more significant IMO.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Me4b91ixZEgWv44USttJ9lsmAupKgHGSDY3XFeIrLbA/edit#) is the specific rubric with detailed explanations and methodology for anyone who is interested like I was. I have to say, I am impressed with how well fleshed out this is.
Warren getting top marks on a scorecard because she studied.   Just want to keep saying her studious, scholarly vibe is everything I want.
Warren coming through with the Straight A vibe. I‚Äôm not surprised!
how tf did they give Sanders such a low score on 'building grassroots power'?
Can someone explain the scorecard and what it is/represents?
Yep. This is probably the biggest reason I'm supporting Warren. If we can't fix our electoral system I don't think any of the other reforms this country urgently needs will last.
And this is why I support her despite not being that progressive on economic issues.
Bernie Sanders is the most grassroots  Candidate in the entire history of humans
Right? Yang said the opposite of Trump is an Asian who likes math but I'd suggest it's actually a woman who knows what she's talking about.
>Senator Sanders lost just a few points in this part of the scorecard. He has only endorsed one progressive congressional primary challenger so far this cycle, and he declined to participate in Indivisible‚Äôs candidate interview process, citing scheduling conflicts.
Ok, well, *first*, his score wasn't "low"; it's at 91%.  Second, they explained:  > Senator Sanders lost just a few points in this part of the scorecard. He has only endorsed one progressive congressional primary challenger so far this cycle, and he declined to participate in Indivisible‚Äôs candidate interview process, citing scheduling conflicts.  Third, why are we talking about Sanders anyway instead of Warren? She got a 97% in that category :)  > Senator Warren received the top score in this section by investing in progressive, grassroots activism in exciting new ways. Although our scores do not reflect who was the first to adopt a particular position, Sen. Warren has also led the field in making new commitments that center the grassroots‚Äîsuch as rejecting super PACs and exclusive high-dollar fundraisers or committing not to appoint donors to positions of power.   > Senator Warren has also won the support of movement organizations in the primary. And by supporting down-ballot candidates like Marie Newman and Jessica Cisneros, she‚Äôs demonstrating real political courage while fighting to make the Democratic Party a more progressive and inclusive force in government.
He has a 91%. You consider that low?
My question is why are there so many Sandernistas in a Warren subreddit?
https://scorecard.indivisible.org/
This is the reason I prefer Warren over Sanders. We can't afford to waste time and political capital on even the most urgent social reforms until we've secured our election system and fixed out broken democracy. Because if we don't do those things immediately, we'll probably lose the Senate in 2022, the White House in 2024, and then we can kiss the idea of free and fair elections goodbye.
Part of what I initially liked about Buttigieg were his SCOTUS reform proposals.
My top reason as well. She seems to get the moment we're in.
Bernie had a plan before Warren did  Hastag AmendmentKing
The opposite of Trump would be a smart, morally courageous woman with relevant job experience.
Bias disclosure: Bernie first pick, Warren second pick  It‚Äôs certainly not a good look when they list him being too busy to come do an interview with them as one of the reasons that he got a lower score.   I also don‚Äôt see how him not endorsing more people is an indicator of *his* grassroots support. Especially when you look at who he‚Äôs been endorsed by and his individual donor count.  As to why it should matter even if Warren is your first pick, if any of the non-progressives try to use this against Warren this is the angle they will take. That because you could look at this as a flaw in the way they determine Sander‚Äôs grassroots movement, the entire thing should be discounted .  Their follow up to that will be some disingenuous insinuations about how establishment candidates have the real grassroots support.  Edit: Yes downvoting this is super helpful and will definitely have a positive impact on the polls
[removed]
Because of the Bernie blackout duh /s
Some can't see anything positive about another candidate without seeing it as a negative for theirs.
Lower than I would've expected, yeah.
I'm here since I joined before I decided to back Bernie (was between Bernie and Warren), and I'd still be very happy with Warren as the nominee. I do apologize for all the Bernie supporters that are here to complain
Because a lot of them think they can go to other subs and convince those supporters to move to Bernie.
They run a very negative campaign for him.  I'm not sure if he is on board with that, but it doesn't look like he cares to try and curb it at all.  Everything is rigged, and everyone else is evil are not well thought out recruitment tactics for gaining allies and friends.
They're everywhere on Reddit.
Because Warren is a popular 2nd choice for Sanders supporters and many support both candidates.
I can't speak for my personal army of clones but I'm only one person and I don't think it's fair to dismiss me just because Warren isn't my *first* choice.
I think there is a strong case for both and should he win the presidency I believe Sanders will fight corruption and money in politics.  I think Warren will be more effective in general though.
Ugh. Let‚Äôs not have that anti-American hashtag floating about. #NoMonarchs
[Bro what are you talking about Bernie is a leader on campaign reform and the only candidate to have never taken any big dollar donations.](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-and-fair-elections/)   Supporting Warren does not mean spreading misinformation about a fellow progressive. Plus he has been advocating for M4A his entire 40 yr political career and it‚Äôs one of the most pressing issues in our country and the issue voters are most interested in talking about (30,000 people die each year bc they lack insurance)which is why Warren has had to defend her position against grifters like Pete every single debate.
>I also don‚Äôt see how him not endorsing more people is an indicator of *his* grassroots support. Especially when you look at who he‚Äôs been endorsed by and his individual donor count.  I disagree. Downballots are extremely important, and presidential candidates should be endorsing them more. For one, Bernie (or any dem nominee) is not going to get anything done without a Congress that will work with him. Endorsing downballots will strengthen grassroots movements both locally and nationally.   Anyway, Bernie still got a really good score, so supporters should use this to make his already great grassroots movement even better.
> I also don‚Äôt see how him not endorsing more people is an indicator of his grassroots support.  You're making an assumption that's what that category is supposed to be measuring.  They're looking at broader grassroots power beyond the individual campaign: > Building Grassroots Power: Indivisibles know that national change won‚Äôt come from any one leader - it will take a movement. Indivisibles want a candidate who is committed to building grassroots power, as demonstrated by their fundraising, campaign strategy and management, support for other progressive candidates, and their engagement with Indivisible groups.
>Their follow up to that will be some disingenuous insinuations about how establishment candidates have the real grassroots support.  Except none of the "establishment" candidates scored well in that category. Like did you actually read those scorecards or just read somewhere that Bernie didn't get top spot so you came here to tell us how wrong that is?  >As to why it should matter even if Warren is your first pick, if any of the non-progressives try to use this against Warren this is the angle they will take.   First of all, how and why would any non-progressives try to use this against Warren? The only people who have any concerns with this are Bernie people complaining he didn't get 1st place. Use this to push your candidate to do better instead of trying to discredit it because it doesn't show what you want.
Obviously not. Not sure why another candidate out-performing Bernie means that the scorecard is questionable instead of commending another candidate for doing well.
Then talk about it in the Sanders sub.  Just b/c he built a good campaign in 2016 doesn't mean he owns the rights to "grassroots" or is the only one good at it.  Further, Indivisible lays out *exactly* what their parameters are and actually explain *why* they scored people as they did; I don't see how it's questionable if they've explained why Sanders falls *slightly* shorter (we're only talking a 6-pt difference in the first place).
I mean, it is an election
There's no problem with liking Bernie as well as Warren! The problem is when people start tearing her down to build Bernie up in her own bloody subreddit.
Yeah, they seem to do that a lot here unfortunately. I noticed they were also all over the Kamala Harris sub when she dropped out.
That is possible.  The people trying that don't seem to understand how to do it though.  You also need to have thick skin.  Adults have honest disagreements.  You must also recognize all politicians have weak points and there are fair criticisms of all of them as well.  That seems to be the hardest pill for the Sanders crowd to swallow.  Like it or not, there are many people out there that think electing a 79 year old that just had a heart attack to an extremely stressful and important job is a very bad idea.  You have to walk away politely at that point because you are not going to talk them into it being a good idea no matter what you say.
We‚Äôre not trying to dismiss you for preferring Bernie over Liz. It‚Äôs just that when people come here to try to drive in ‚ÄúBernie blackout!‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs all rigged!‚Äù or ‚Äúhow tf did Liz do better than him on __‚Äù  Like ok, you‚Äôre entitled to believe that, and we won‚Äôt overtly judge you for it, but does it need to be on this specific thread in this specific sub?
I think it‚Äôs fair to dismiss you because you‚Äôre arguing for a higher score for Bernie, when the article clearly explains why his score was lower.
That makes me sad for butterflies. How about #nomonarchy
>Not sure why another candidate out-performing Bernie means that the scorecard is questionable instead of commending another candidate for doing well.  When the area is "building grassroots power"... yeah, that does make the scorecard questionable.

[deleted]
I disagree with this sentiment. There are plenty of people that are fans of both Warren and Sanders, and we should be able to have a reasonable discussion about it
Where delegates are awarded proportionally.
That's why we added Rule 11.
I didn't say anything like any of the things you're quoting as examples of bad conduct.  I just asked a question about Bernie.  I know that this isn't a Bernie sub but clearly we're all interested in a fair and well-contested primary, right?
OK
I don't think so.  Being able to build grassroots power is extremely important.  That's the only way anything will actually get done.  It's obviously also going to be really important to a grassroots organization.
Please see [my other comment in this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/e97deg/elizabeth_warren_is_the_only_presidential/fahnmvb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  It'd be questionable if say, Bernie was in 5th place and Buttigieg was 1st and they refused to disclose their grading rubric. But Warren has a long history of grassroots organizing, and by the standards that Indivisible clearly outlined and linked right in that webpage, so I'm not sure what you're questioning.
They explain their reasoning why he lost a few points on that aspect of the score, makes sense to me. It's still a very good score on Bernie's part
> Because she's clearly not outperforming him   This is pretty subjective. Based on their scorecard, she is. They laid out their parameters and reasoning for the scores, they weren't arbitrary. It was based more on "who is polling higher at this very specific moment".   > Can we get some actual discussion here instead of licking Warren's toes on repeat?   This is disingenuous. No one is "licking Warren's toes on repeat". This is an Elizabeth Warren specific sub, if you want to circle jerk how Bernie is "THE" grassroots candidate and no one else is ever allowed to compete you can do that in a different sub. I don't understand why Bernie supporters just ignore the fact that Warren has a competitive grassroots movement to Bernie; there can be more than one. She has also endorsed more progressive down ballot candidates than him currently, that's part of the "movement" you all like talking about so much.
But she is, she is building a new and more in-depth grass roots campaign with better messaging as you will notice by the messaging discipline. She has her own support and doesn't bash others like some other campaigns. I will likely never for for some campaigns because of absurd litmus test fielded by undisciplined supporters who think they can bully there way to the bully pulpit.
That all helps him and no one else.  He has been pretty weak on helping others get elected, which is not great in a system where you need 218 Congressmen, minimum of 51 Senators (realistically 60 these days), and 5 SCOTUS justices to say your law is constitutional to make changes as a President.
4 million DONATIONS, not donors. And give me a heads up when the 1 million volunteers translates to expanding his base. Because while he has gained back ground after the heart attack, he's still not polling as well as he should be.  I will say that I would be extremely happy if Bernie gets the nomination. He's far and away my second choice. But I'm still skeptical that he's campaigning with an intention of building upon his current base of supporters, which is essential to getting a majority of delegates.
> small dollar individual donors (\~4 million)   You mean donations\* not donors. Keep in mind too that Bernie already had built up name recognition and infrastructure this cycle because he ran in 2016. Warren's grassroots movement is still competitive to his and she hasn't run for president before.  > I feel like they should‚Äôve tied.   The reason they didn't tie though is because Warren supports more down-ballot races at this moment. If Bernie is pushed by this to endorse more progressive down-ballot candidates and do the interview with Indivisible he can make that a tie/possibly get 100% in that category. They said that they will continue updating the scores throughout the primary. Take this as a note to push your candidate rather than to hand-wave it away because you don't agree with their conclusions.
I mean, of *course* we can and should have conversations about their policy positions and which is better, but this isn't about that; this is just people complaining about a different candidate's rating from an outside organization--which has nothing to do with Warren--when the conversations should be about *Warren's* rating and what that means in terms of getting votes.  It's a digression; I don't think quibbling over definitions of grassroots is the point of this post.
Yes, and I think that score for Bernie is fair, given the reasons they provided. It's still a really good score.  Bernie supporters can take this as an opportunity to improve their already great grassroots movement. Maybe send a tip to the campaign to have Bernie endorse more downballot democratic / progressive candidates?
I care about Elizabeth Warren not about where Bernie is ranked and why his score is lower.
Right. But I think it‚Äôs fair to say that the both of them are different in good ways. For example, Warren‚Äôs record on gun control is undoubtedly more progressive than Bernie‚Äôs, and he did once have to rely on the NRA. And Bernie‚Äôs record on healthcare also slightly edges out Liz, who only really began supporting the policy in 2008 (though I think this is fine lol). Neither of this takes away from the many ways that both are fierce progressive candidates now, especially since their ideology is extremely alike, and strongly for the people against special interests.   Obviously these people like both candidates. Why wouldn‚Äôt they?They‚Äôre both great. That being said, There are places where one edges out the other, and this article did a good job explaining the exact criteria for the scores and also explicitly notes that Bernie‚Äôs literally only 4 points behind her.   Anyone can be a Sanders supporter and come to this sub. Most are welcomed, because we align in most ways. But it‚Äôs frustrating if they try to come just to pull us towards them. This is not specifically targeted towards you, by the way‚Äî but you should know that when people say ‚ÄúSandernistas‚Äù here, they‚Äôre not referring to any and all Berners (the vast majority of us supported Bernie in 2016 and have him as a strong second choice even now), they‚Äôre referring only to the trolls who come here screaming and ranting about how Bernie is the ‚ÄúOG progressive‚Äù and Liz is a ‚Äúcorporatist shill‚Äù or whatever.
>the standards that Indivisible clearly outlined  It's great that they disclosed their rubric but that doesn't automatically mean it's a good rubric.
I think a lot of Bernie stans believe nobody CAN be better at Bernie at anything. So if someone says he's not the best at anything, it's obviously biased or wrong. Honestly that's the scariest thing about his movement to me, his supporters are really into creating echo chambers. I like Bernie himself, but he needs to address his base.
[removed]
What about it doesn't make it a good rubric? Which part of it do you disagree with? Is there something missing from it that you would like to see factored in?
I mean, it also just shows how uninformed about other politicians they are. Obama had a huge grassroots movement in 2008-2012. And Warren's record with grassroots organizing goes back to when she first ran for the senate in 2012:  From a [2012 NPR article](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/06/02/154222963/elizabeth-warren-leaps-over-primary-challenge-in-massachusetts) about her primary win  >Democratic Party chair John Walsh said Warren would "make Massachusetts families proud," as the *Boston Herald* reports:   >   >"Elizabeth Warren made history today because of the strength of her impressive grassroots organization and her record as a tireless advocate for middle class families throughout Massachusetts."  From [2014 on the Run Warren Run](http://www.runwarrenrun.org/plantowin/) website:  >In 2012 and 2014, Elizabeth Warren won accolades for her extraordinary prowess as a Democratic fundraiser‚Äînot by raking in big-money contributions, but by inspiring legions of small donors. In 2016, Warren won‚Äôt get a flood of cash from Wall Street‚Äîshe‚Äôs done too much to hold banksters accountable.  [Jan. 2014 SXSW](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2014/2014/events/event_IAP23462) event description:  >In 2012, consumer advocate and Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren built the strongest grassroots digital program in Senate history. The Massachusetts Senate campaign raised more money from small-dollar online donors than any Senate campaign ever, and built an online-to-offline field program that knocked on more doors than any other campaign in Massachusetts history.  There's plenty more with a simple google search.
He will never "address his base," because this is by design. The call is coming from inside the house.
He needs to reel them in, but they won't respond well to a dose of reality.  This is why when asked how he gets things passed without compromising he starts chanting "revolution", and something about harassing those that don't agree with him.  The thing is if that worked he would have already done it.  You don't need to be President to try that.  He can do that tomorrow, but he won't because obviously it will fail and the house of cards comes tumbling down.    He either needs to compromise on his ideas which will water them down a bit, take a more stepping stone approach to ease fears, or trade away something huge to Republicans to get anything passed.  Warren has pitched the second option and comes off as much more reasonable because of it.  Sanders seems like the most likely of the bunch to come up empty because of how hardline he is.

Only because you‚Äôre acting like one.   They both scored above 90 and they explained why his score was lower than hers. Chill out.

This is amazing. Thank you!

I want to believe the best about Bernie, but this is one of the major differences that has me for Warren over him. I have lots of examples of Bernie telling people things, but honestly I don't see him listening that often. Warren puts it in her plans that she's gonna bring people to the table for things. I can clearly see she makes an effort to listen, and I think that makes her a better leader.
[removed]
Don't feed the trolls.
Listen I am a fan of Warren, she has for a long time been one of my favorite politicians because of her strength against corporations.   But if she wants to win she‚Äôs gonna need sanders progressives and considering she‚Äôs in third then if she doesn‚Äôt win she‚Äôll want Sanders as president instead because she literally has formed her career fighting credit card companies and Biden used to be nicknamed the Senator from MBNA because he fought hard for his credit card company donors and made it harder for Americans to free themselves of debt.   So this rejection of Sanders progressives hurts Warren because it makes progressives have to choose a side and attacks a fellow champion for progressives which hurts our movement. Saying that Bernie doesn‚Äôt listen to people is baffling and sounds like something a CNN elitist panelist would say.   It is the same energy as when other progressive supporters of different candidates claim Warren isn‚Äôt a progressive because she was once a republican and thereby erases her amazing progressive activism. They are friends for a reason, their values align. I copy and pasted examples of Bernie going out of his way listen and give a voice to everyday Americans, because I don‚Äôt think misconceptions should be pushed around like that reconstructing history the way centrist want is harmful to all progressive voices.

Warren Is On A Mission To Take Away Moscow Mitch's Filibuster Power & Win A Senate Majority
This is the thing. Democrats must have senate candidates in every 2020 race. A week ago, a Democratic Senate election committee was sending out a warning that there were enough Senate republicans who aren't even being contested, which would ensure that the GOP would hold onto the Senate majority. The Democratic party needs to ramp up its recruiting of Senate candidates fast. Find candidates in the grassroots. Find candidates among the also-rans currently running for president. The 2020 race must be decisive or nothing will change.
if by some miracle we win the presidency, 60 seats in the senate and keep the house we should go fucking scorched earth. salt their fucking fields. i want packed courts, codified norms, jailed corrupt politicians etc.
Her support for abolishing the filibuster is one of the reasons I support Warren!  Even if Democrats win the House, the Senate, and the presidency, while the filibuster is in place, it will prevent them from passing most of their platform. There are items that you can use reconciliation process to pass, but even that would be procedurally and politically difficult.   If you think Democrats have good policy ideas, this is an awful result.  It could also create a political disaster for Democrats in 2022 and 2024. If voters turn out next year to vote in a Democratic President and Congress in the belief they'll enact the Democratic agenda and little of that gets passed, many will be feel let down and stay home home during subsequent election cycles.  Abolishing the filibuster should lead to better policy, and it's good politics too.
We need a senate majority, and the state of Massachusetts needs to make it a law that the governor appoints a senator from the same party, if they have not already, because if we win a majority in the senate somehow but lose her seat if she's president, it'd be awkward as fuck
A few steps to ensure a democratic majority:  1) DC Statehood 2) Puerto Rico statehood 3) If they want to vote, split California into three or more states
Totally unrelated to any of this, but that thumbnail image for this post, I can envision a hell of a game for iPad.

She as President would have no say in the mater at all. Right now she has one vote out of 100 as a senator.
you guys get Warren does not stand a chance.
Here's what I want... I want us to dilute SCOTUS ... there is no hard limit on the judge count.   I also think it would be better for our democracy.  This way it won't be a death match fight every time we have a new nominee.  If they don't like it - tough.  I literally don't care
We need 50 seats in the senate and get rid of the filibuster. The only reason the republicans haven‚Äôt already gotten rid of it is that they don‚Äôt care about legislation. They care about judges, tax cuts and deregulation. All can be achieved with a simple majority.
Elizabeth is the women to scorch that earth. Do you think Joe would?
To late Trump has packed the courts! Lmao Scorched earth!
Only for a few months triggering a special election
Number 3 will never happen
Puerto Rico should absolutely be a state, on instance of legitimate referendum. I don't think or even want to say that it would solve everything, but a lot of the problems they're having there wouldn't happen with the infrastructure and accountability statehood would bring.  I do think D.C. is a different animal. The Constitution established the District of Columbia as federal land. At the same time, it's ridiculous that so many people are without congressional representation, in either chamber. There's no reason they shouldn't and people in Wyoming or Vermont should. I think it's a bit problematic to make it a state though, so I'm torn. Maybe all but the essentially federal land should be absorbed into Maryland.  And, to respond to that last point, splitting California into 3 or more states to win influence in the Senate is terrible when you consider that once you shatter that precedent, there's nothing stopping Texas from breaking into 5 states, or Wyoming from breaking into 10.
Looks like it came from Kurzgesagt.
Sticking to one nickname is better - keeps everybody on the exact same page. The more nicknames that get thrown out, the less any particular one has an impact.
If you read what she wrote, you'll see she's not talking about something she would do as president. She's talking about something she's attempting to do _now_, through campaigning: get more members of her party to win seats in the Senate.  It's actually a refreshing _change_ from the usual "when I'm president, I'll do these legislative branch things..." ;-)
She's been consistently scoring during this crucial stretch of her campaign. I still think Biden has a better shot as of now (ugh, please no), but Warren is here to stay in the top tier, unlike Mayor Pete who seems to have had his strong polling just fizzle out.
Thanks for your opinion, guy whose entire Reddit history is comments on "tweaker porn."
I think she has a chance but if she does win, her senate seat will be given up and the republican governor of Massachusetts could appoint anyone they want from what I‚Äôve heard, I might be wrong idk

Warren could even resign from the Senate as President elect, which would trigger the special election even sooner.
True but considering how screwed we are every month counts!
Number 4: the state of Assenispia.
We can dream. It was kind of a possibility a few years ago. It‚Äôs also the same deal in Maryland, having the DC suburbs form their own state. They‚Äôd be the state of ‚ÄúPotomac‚Äù I believe.
All of the proposals for D.C. Statehood basically shrink the District of Columbia to be just a few blocks of government buildings basically, then creating a new state (I believe they call it Washington, Douglass Commonwealth in the House Bill this sessions so that it's still "D.C.") in the rest of the city.  I agree with you about splitting states.
Texas is I believe the only state in the union that has the actual right to do this. Whereas even if it had the right, WY would never meet the population minima. And CA can‚Äôt split unless it knows where water will come from; it would probably involve renegotiating the Colorado river compact, so good luck with that.
Well all she has to do is convince McConnell oh and the Democratic leadership to go along...neither of them will. And I'm still not convinced it is a good idea myself. Just imagine what it would have been like the first two years of Trumps presidency without it.  >Trump calls for end to filibuster 05/30/17   https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/335594-trump-calls-for-end-to-filibuster  Mitch wouldn't do it for Trump so...don't expect it to happen now.
No. Even laying aside the questionable-at-best constitutionality, the majority of the lower courts you‚Äôd be drawing from have also been stacked, with much crazier people and with much less public outrage.   A better answer is [jurisdiction stripping.](https://overcast.fm/+HG-WHXkoE/43:11)
It was a rhetorical question. Of course Joe wouldn‚Äôt.  He would keep things the same and urge us all to move on.
Kavanaugh and Thomas both.

> We can dream.  Dream of California breaking up? No thanks. The only people who want that here are those nutjobs in the state of Jefferson, up north.   And I say "up north" as someone who lives in the Bay Area.
Fair enough. I guess I haven't looked at any proposal for D.C. statehood further than surface level
Of course. I wasn't even considering the feasibility of a move like splitting up, I just meant once one state overcame them, others would look to follow if it meant greater power in federal government for those in charge.
Texas has the right because Congress gave it permission to do so in 1845. Any other state would have to petition Congress as Massachusetts and Virginia did.
they did end the filibuster for a lot of nominations so really the filibuster is meaningless. not like its being used to prevent a bunch of bills from coming to the floor that mitch would otherwise love to vote on. the senate as a body is really outdated and honestly we would be better off without.

I met some people in the Palm Springs area who were certainly for it.  The rich people there are all Republicans who don't want to pay the high taxes.
> Texas has the right because Congress gave it permission to do so in 1845.  Yeah, but then Texas left, and Congress didn't give them permission when they came back in 1870. So that agreement doesn't apply anymore.
> so really the filibuster is meaningless  You aren't really that naive are you?
83 ethics complaints stemming from false rape allegations. Lmao all of which are now dismissed. Perjury LMAO!
I don't understand people like that. If money is all they love just move somewhere with low taxes. Of course, those places tend not to have the industries that made them rich in the first place, which is why they stay.
It also explicitly says that the US (not Texas) itself can split Texas in order to maintain a balance of free and slave states.  There's no way it's possible in 2019, as much as Texas secessionists want it to be.
Texas didn't leave in a legal sense. The Confederacy was never recognized and the Supreme Court found that none of the states that declared secession had the legal right to do so in the first place, which is why West Virginia wasn't reabsorbed - the legislature of the Restored Government of Virginia, which acted as a government-in-exile for the whole of Virginia despite its representatives coming only from the pro-Union trans-Allegheny counties, granted permission to Kanawha to become its own state just as the legislature of Massachusetts did to Maine 43 years earlier.
The filibuster does more harm than good. Thankful Republicans arent good at governing. Poor leadership and just general chaos on thier side has sunk more bad bills than the filibuster. It lost most of its meaning with overuse and not even having to hold the floor anymore. 60 votes to pass legislation sounds good on paper, if you like the status quo. But at this point if we can a majority to agree with a majority in the House and president well then so be it. Those 40 senators had thier chance and they lost. If there is a problem take it up with the voters.

I got the sense that money out there is old money, so they are likely getting rich somewhere else.  They just want to golf and look down on the rest of the world for being poor.
> The filibuster does more harm than good.  Hard to quantify that...it would be hard to measure the shit that would be done if all they needed was a majority   > if you like the status quo  Not the reason for it at all. It is the counter balance to quick changes in the law. It is a double edged sword.  Now do I think that we need to make changes that will be near impossible with the filibuster yes, like Medicare for all, but are you willing to give up the only restraint you have against the White Christian Nationalist and what they may try to do next time they are in power?
Lmao! Christine Ford was not well founded. Look liberals have abused words like racism and ethics to the point they are meaningless. So when a liberal makes an ethics complaint for literally anything it is looked into. The very fact the complaints were dismissed is more then enough proof that they were absurd. Much like impeaching Trump, you can impeach a sitting Justice. The fact neither have happened is further proof the claims lack reasonable foundation.
[deleted]
Dear............ can I see the source that states the ethics complaints were indeed well founded? Or you should just look up ethics complaints.   1 no ethics complaint that is investigated comes to a conclusion that you are suggesting.  2 What about all the ethics complaints made prior to becoming a justice?  3 stop reading others opinions and regurgitating as facts.   4 Word salad?  "Dismissed -with comment that they are \[e\]very serious"    "well \[founded-because\] the lower courts have no authority to try a sitting SCOTUS judge"  PLEASE HAVE AN ADULT TEACH YOU HOW TO FORM A SENTENCE!   5 Non sequitur argument:  "He got off on a technicality."
Elizabeth Warren on Bloomberg 2020: 'I guess he figured it was cheaper than paying a two-cent wealth tax'
Good article but then I read the comment section.  The bots and nutso Republicans are out in force to fight the wealth tax.  So talk face to face with your friends and family about Warren and the sense of her wealth tax.  America can change for the better but the money and power will fight us tooth and nail to keep the status quo.
"Here‚Äôs the argument from these guys: ‚ÄòWe got out there and we worked hard. We earned this money. This is what a market economy is all about,‚Äô‚Äù Warren said.   ‚ÄúAnd here‚Äôs my answer to that: You worked hard. You had a great idea. You hit the big moment, and you made it big. Good for you! I‚Äôm glad to hear it.‚Äù  She continued: ‚ÄúBut understand this: You built a great fortune here in America, I guarantee you built at least in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate,‚Äù Warren said.   ‚ÄúAll we‚Äôre saying is if you make it big, I mean really big, I mean top 1/10th of 1% big, pitch in two cents so everybody else gets a chance at this.‚Äù¬†  Just because I think this bears repeating.
This already posted in r/politics and the comment section is lacking Warren fans. You know what to do, remember to link back to this sub to help grow Warren's online support, i would do it myself but I'm banned so all I can do is give silver, and remind the good folks in this sub to support their candidate.
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Pre-Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   [Caucus](https://www.aclu-ia.org/en/how-find-your-caucus-site): February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
Non-supporter here, here's a real and sincere question:  Bloomberg's net worth is mostly tied up in assets - but not even public equities in public companies, but his private ownership in Bloomberg, some real estate, etc. Bloomberg Ltd as a private company has no traded stocks and has no market value according to the stock market.  You want to tax 2% of Bloomberg's ownership in his own company. How do you calculate that? There's an entire industry of firms that do valuation work because it's so hard to assign a solid number to a private company. I find it hard to believe that the government will find a fair and effective method of determining private company value.  What about other private assets, like artwork, cars, boats, furniture? What about intellectual property? Can you really "tax" 2% of the value of an idea? Who decides this?
You've seen what happened to Weinstein and Cosby. These people physically and mentally break down if they're stopped from doing the only thing they've ever known how to do. There's a lot of things humans need to do just to survive. We need to socialize, we need to eat, we need water. People like Bloomberg, Trump, Biden, and most other politicians, they need to remain relevant. It's like a mental illness almost.
"I guess he figured it was cheaper than paying a two-cent wealth tax.‚Äù   First class comedic chops!
Warren is my first choice and I'll be voting for her in the primary.  But can we not try to tear down other Democratic candidates?  Bloomberg is miles better than Trump, and if he wins the nomination we need to be voting for him and not mad due to infighting.  No?
That's how threads always start with Warren, believe it or not it's pretty easy to leave supportive comments on r/politics and they usually accrue more up votes.
The best part is the vast majority of them make less than $50k/yr and would never actually be impacted by it in a (completely selfish view) negative way.
i dont think the wealth tax will work. thats whynso many other countries stopped using it.
Love this explanation of the wealth tax!  I think 2% isnt quite high enough but we can always tinker with that after it gets passed and "2 cents" makes for great messaging.
Why are you banned?
The valuation methods need to be figured out in detail. That's to be expected when you propose an entirely new type of tax.   From [Warren's website](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax) (emphasis mine):  >**The IRS already has rules to assess the value of many assets for estate tax purposes**. The Ultra-Millionaire Tax is a chance for the IRS to tighten these existing rules to close loopholes and to develop new valuation rules as needed. For example, the IRS would be authorized to use cutting-edge retrospective and prospective formulaic valuation methods for certain harder-to-value assets like closely held business and non-owner-occupied real estate.
What prompts you to bring up Weinstein and Cosby in particular? They're known for being sexual predators, which AFAIK Bloomberg is not? In any case, referring to a group of two Jewish and one black American specifically as "these people" seems ill advised.
[removed]
That's why I think it's mostly astroturfing. Because immediately after anything positive of Warren shows up there's a million comments about "Pocahontas" and calling her a liar. But if you come in later it's all generally positive. Someone really hates her, and it doing everything they can to try and shape the narrative about her artificially.
r/politics is being brigaded hard. Sanders' polling has barely changed and yet r/politics which was generally neutral or even Warren-leaning is getting slammed by posts where there aren't many comments, and they're all pretty bland and WayOfTheBern-y
Please explain what you mean. I think you‚Äôre using the phrase ‚Äúwealth tax‚Äù to describe policies that are wildly different in size and scope. European wealth taxes often started at a much lower threshold and impacted working class families while simultaneously exempting a wide variety of assets that contributed to ‚Äúwealth‚Äù. They were minimally punitive to the upper class‚Äîin other words, a wealth tax in name only.  What Elizabeth Warren has proposed is dramatically more sophisticated, designed to deter the export of wealth to other countries, assess and capture wealth associated with assets, etc. These fiscal policies could not be more different, and frankly, we‚Äôre not a part of the EU‚Äîwhich makes an enormous difference in how capital enters and leaves the country.  EDIT: Autocorrect.
Move their money/citizenship in tax havens?
Maybe, maybe not.  At least it moves the conversation from the status quo and works to reduce the real problems facing us due to inequity.
That's a right wing talking point. Other countries can't tax expats and they applied here wealh tax to the middle class her bill is different.
While I am generally inclined to agree with you many if the other nations that tried it were in incredibly different circumstances.
You need to keep it within the reasonable rate of risk.  If you put it at 6-10% then you are taxing them more than they make which will absolutely inhibit growth and innovation.  If you tax them at or around the amount the economy grows annually you are more likely to see less avoidance/fraud and likely to get more money back.
I accidently flooded the que by posting to many Warren articles over the summer, I assume I was reported on by people who don't like Warren.
I got banned for commenting that the POTUS was likely to die of a heart attack before finishing a second term.
I got banned for telling a troll to go play in traffic.
I like the way her Corporate Tax Plan works.  >Under current law, companies have an incentive to report high profits to their shareholders while reporting low profits to the IRS. This tax would be based entirely on book profits to reduce this incentive.   Tax them based on what they claim theyre worth to other investors.
I speak of people in power. If you want non-pedophile example, look at Manafort.   I'm not the one that pointed out their heritage. The topic at hand is rich and powerful men.
Maybe because it‚Äôs relevant considering Harvey is currently in pre-trial and that scumbag is trying to manipulate the public and the justice system with his recent back surgery and having to use a walker while going to these court proceedings. Now that he is powerless and he has no control he‚Äôs doing anything he can to get any sort of leniency from the judge or prosecutors.   You should probably pay attention to the news; and I‚Äôd like to know what prompted you to bring up the fact that one of them is black and one of them is Jewish. sexual abuse comes in any race, gender, creed etc. it is all about power and race is irrelevant when it comes to this.
Removed for Rule 4 (Dividing Democrats) and Rule 8 (Civility).
Probably the pricks who own Reddit given how dedicated bots on this site are to Warren bashing.
She and Bernie are the two most truthful people in politics, and I'm glad they are both near the top - gives me hope. Even the Pocahontas slur turned out to be correct - although they still found a way to slam her for doing the DNA test.
It‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a woman on the left. The right wingers who invaded Bernie‚Äôs movement and act like they support him on this website use her to drive a wedge in the progressive movement. They literally planned this on 4chan.
I'll push back on that only to make 2 points.  First, a big problem with massive wealth is it brings the velocity of money down so dramatically.  That wealth isnt helping the economy when its not moving.  This is a big reason why trickle down doesnt work - you give (or, in this case, allow to retain) wealthy people money, they dont spend it in a way that causes it to change hands and stimulate growth.  Second, if we're serious (and I think we are) in our concerns about the power imbalance (political, economic, cultural, etc.) that the current state of wealth inequality allows, we should support a measure that would actually reduce, rather than simply slow the expansion of, that power imbalance.
Those fuckers
So you‚Äôre like permanently banned?
Worth it
Are we not allowed to suggest truths now?
Geez. My ban for suggesting Bernie should drop out could happen any time then.
Yes, it will actually simplify the work that companies have to do keeping two entire sets of books, one for tax purposes and one for management reporting. It will reduce work for a bunch of high-priced tax consultants and lawyers though, and that is a probably a good thing for the economy overall.
I like this.
Hey, don't shoot the messenger. If I thought it was intentional I wouldn't have interacted with you in the first place.
We gotta stop pretending like these kinds of comments are from machines or people in russia. Take a moment to check their post history; they're always (in my experience) very obviously humans who live in the united states. Pretending their not is ignoring a very real problem.
It's more than Reddit though, Twitter is even worse.
 >I'll push back on that only to make 2 points.  First, a big problem with massive wealth is it brings the velocity of money down so dramatically.

The wealthy‚Äôs money is almost always invested in stocks and bonds.  Very few have their money trapped in a vault so their money is factually in play in the economy.    Getting money out of politics would do wonderful things for the strength of our democracy.  The wealth tax isn‚Äôt the best way to do that as any impact it has on corruption will be small.  Fortunately she has a different plan for that.
Yup forever. I also got banned from r/Democrats for linking to this sub today but I saw he membership number go up today so I call it a win.
Apparently not
Exactly, I‚Äôve been accused of being a Russian troll on Facebook after telling a lady that she was very clearly a hypocrite and a racist towards Mexicans while spouting liberal nonsense on her page and if you go on my page you can clearly see that I am not a Russian troll and I mentioned that to the person I was in an argument with and they still insisted that I was a Russian troll. Some people are too stupid it‚Äôs baffling to me that they know how to use social media.
Why would malicious reporting get you a permaban? That sucks.
I‚Äôm proud of my /r/Dems ban.  Someone was getting downvoted for claiming the sub was only anti Trump and nothing about the 2020 candidates and I responded with a screenshot of the top 10 topics, 8 of which were about republicans.  Trolling...
Working Families Party Endorses Elizabeth Warren
The discussion in this thread is no longer productive.   Please treat each other with kindness, we are all on the same side.
[https://twitter.com/WorkingFamilies/status/1173614425565204480](https://twitter.com/WorkingFamilies/status/1173614425565204480)  &#x200B;  Was a blowout: Per [@WorkingFamilies](https://twitter.com/WorkingFamilies/) statement on its endorsement, Warren got 60.9% of the ranked-choice vote, to 35.8% for Sanders.
This is obviously v cool but I'm *slightly* annoyed that the NYT managed to get this scoop before those of us who voted in the WFP's endorsement process found out.
There has been some divisive talk in this thread, so I'd just like to remind everyone about Rule 4 (Dividing Democrats). Although Warren and Sanders are competing for the same endorsements (and nomination), ultimately we are all on the same team. It is okay to disagree with either candidate, but please refrain from degrading them or their supporters.
They endorsed Bernie in 2016 because he was good. They're endorsing Liz now because she's even better. That simple.
Oh god I was slammed for defending this decision in the replies. Bernie stans are insufferable sometimes.  I'm glad they support a progressive candidate so they don't irk me like fascists do. But they hate Warren so much its maddening.
Wow, this is pretty big to win it over Bernie.   Bernie supporters are furious about this.
It looks like (so far) Castro is the only WFP-endorsement candidate to put out an "it was an honor just to be nominated" type of statement - Sanders, Booker, and de Blasio were all in the running as well. (Harris was in originally but dropped out rather than do their live Q&A or something?)
This is pretty stunning considering that they endorsed Sanders in 2016 (if I remember correctly.)  The Warren-Sanders dynamic is shifting.
Just heard about this in my email.  This is awesome!
Gosh the Bernie bro's (and ladies) are not happy about this. Most of the comments call her a corporatist and a sell out. Hard to imagine who would pass that purity test.
I don't think he's drop b/c of this. And i've said it before he has the money and organization to go till the end....but if i were him i'd think of dropping sooner than later.  the energy that bernie had is now behind warren.

When you realize Bernie Bros are actually Russian trolls everything they say and do makes sense, and you can better ignore them.

I'm sure that some are.  However, many of those "supporters" are just Russians/Republicans who are pretending to be progressives.  They need to manufacture division in the Democratic party or Trump doesn't stand a chance.
CFPB = corporatist, apparently.
>Hard to imagine who would pass that purity test.  The answer is always and only Bernie. When it isnt, they change the test until he does pass.
Only Bernie can, its designed that way.
No way Bernie is dropping out any time soon. In 2016 he stayed in long after it was clear he wouldn't win, I see no reason to believe he won't do that again.
Idk billionaires are bad so her wealth tax is actually her greatest hit imo
Who's your second choice
Your comment was removed because it is in violation of rule 4. Please familiarize yourself with the rules - https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/about/rules/
I think you meant to say cheated on by the over 16.8 million voters who preferred Clinton to Sanders. But don't let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory.
This one's malfunctioning.
No one is winning the general without big money. To say otherwise is foolish. The gop has already built a large war chest and corporations/Wall Street/the rich will be shelling out cash to keep their tax cuts and continued fuck the working class.   What funding source can compete with that outside of big money?
Why I‚Äôm I getting down voted
Honestly, Bernie's inability to collect and contain the most toxic-elements of his fan base in 2016 and now has been my main motivation for going to Warren this time around. They're really just insufferable, and he's gone and stacked his own campaign full of them. Even though I like the guy and his agenda more, his terrible campaign decision-making makes me think he just doesn't have the temperament to get done the stuff he's promising.
I know... have you seen literally any /r/politics post about her recently?  It's crazy-toxic mischaracterizations who make sure to note they're voting Sanders; I still want to attribute it mostly to bots because I don't want to attribute it to malice on the part of the campaign for another candidate I respect, but.... I've personally experienced enough real-life static from self-avowed "Bernie bros" or "Bernie stans" to really be less than optimistic. I wish things were better. I wish THEY were better.   I'm not sure I could vote for him cheerfully in a general, if this lack of kindness and decency is what my vote would validate.
Ya just did the opposite of self care, man
Yeah, seems strange. If it's 60.9% to 35.8% you should think that comments shouldn't be so unfavorable for Warren. Sucks when we live in an age where I have to wonder what percentage of the comments on a social media platform come from real people rather than shills or bots.
Remember that many many many of them are bullshit Russians/Republicans who are pretending to be progressives.  They need to manufacture division in the Democratic party or Trump doesn't stand a chance.
It's like a leftist version of MAGA hats burning their Nikes.
Warren didn't support Bernie in 2016 even though he was clearly the candidate closest to her, politically. Instead she played politics and tried to butter up Hillary for a possible spot in her administration. She didn't get the VP spot and in the end it was all a waste anyway. Furthermore, Warren is accepting money from corporate donors in the general election.   So maybe calling her a corporate shill is an inch too far, but you can be damn certain I'm bitter about her role in the 2016 election. I remember wishing that Warren would also run in 2016. And then I remember the dream Sanders / Warren ticket I had drawn up in my head. Perhaps that's still something to hope for, but I can't help but feel resentment towards Warren.  Edit: Y'all can keep downvoting me but I'd love to hear a compelling argument against what I'm saying
[deleted]
That's not always the case though. They're a vocal minority, but they're real and toxic and pretending they're all Russian bots isn't going to make them not exist.  Thankfully, the vast majority are not that way.
Then why are a couple of them his senior staff? Looking at you Sirota for sure. He embodies the concept of Bernie Bro. If they're all Russians, what is he?
They‚Äôd be delusional not to. If Warren wins the primary, she‚Äôll be the most progressive candidate we‚Äôve probably ever seen in a presidential election
These conspiracy theorists probably won't. I talked to a few and they said they would sit the election out. When you have supporters basically saying the person closest ideologically is the anti-Christ, there isn't much hope. Luckily, these are in the minority. Unlike last time, I hope Bernie can reign his people in or Trump will win.

I mean, Bernie's still leading Warren in all of the early states and RCP polling, so let's not get too cocky.
I don't see it either, but I think he should if iowa and NH goes poorly. just based everything i'm seeing he doesn't have what he had in 2016 (when he didn't win), so it's even worse for me this time around.
I'm not a fan because I'm concerned about enforceability and offshoring incentives, but it's a relatively minor concern.
Booker or Beto.
Because you‚Äôre being shady and implying things without actually saying it.
like...... do these dudes understand they could have voted on this? this wasn't some closed-door backroom kind of endorsement deal - I became a (nonpaying) WFP member so I could vote and it wasn't like it was hard or complicated or something.
There was a thread on her tax plan in a leftist group I'm in and several people started in with "WHAT ABOUT SANDERS," saying her plan is stolen from his, a watered down version, she's a fake progressive, etc  [Meanwhile, her tax plan would have a higher payoff:](https://www.gq.com/story/warren-sanders-tax-the-rich)  >"Warren's, which her camp shared with The Washington Post last week, takes the form of an annual 2 percent wealth tax on "ultra-millionaires" who possess more than $50 million in assets; the rate would increase to 3 percent for those with more than $1 billion. (The economists advising Warren estimate that only 75,000 families‚Äîless than 0.1 percent of Americans‚Äîwould be affected.) To preempt the sort of accounting hijinks that would inevitably ensue, the plan also boosts funding for the IRS, imposes a mandatory audit rate on payers, and imposes a one-time penalty for anyone who attempts to evade taxation by renouncing their U.S. citizenship.  >The projected payoff: over ten years, a cool $2.75 trillion.  >Sanders, not to be outdone, provided to the Post on Thursday the details of his preferred mechanism of radical wealth redistribution. This one would overhaul the estate tax by lowering the threshold for payment from $11.18 million to $3.5 million; create mid-tier estate-tax brackets applicable to those with ten figures' worth of wealth; and restore the top 77 percent marginal rate that was abolished in the mid-1970s. It closes a few notorious loopholes and includes measures to prevent farmers, whose business assets make them likelier than most to be subject to the estate tax, from shouldering too heavy a burden. His staff emphasizes that the plan would affect only those fortunate enough to inherit more than $3.5 million‚Äîa mere 0.2 percent of Americans.  >The projected payoff: over ten years, a cool $315 billion. By the time the ultra-rich die, however‚Äîkind of an integral aspect of levying an estate tax‚Äîthe number balloons to a cool $2.2 trillion."  There's a reason Warren's is being touted as the scarier of the two for the rich. I'd be happy with either as president and I don't hold these types of supporters against him but what is with this brand of Sanders fan?
I agree. It is very yikes! I voted for Bernie in the primary but after these years of Trump I am so tired of bullshit and extremists. I need someone with progressive ideas and policies that understand what its really like for people but at the same time trying to bring the democratic party together and convince it to move in the right direction.  edit: I will vote for any dem. including Bernie. Also I think Bernie is a good guy and sincere.  This is more about the extremist element in his supporters or even possible "bernie or bust" hostile foreign elements that take hold.
Honestly, same. I just can‚Äôt get in with that movement because of the hostility. Most Warren supporters I‚Äôve met have similar objectives but are incredibly civil about disagreements in policy. It‚Äôs Warren for me!
This a thousand times. Getting banned from /r/sandersforpresident for saying that Warren is a decent option just pushed me more into her camp. Imagine an administration of these wanna-be-militant children
It doesn‚Äôt help that he decided to make people like Bri Joy important parts of his campaign.
I hear you but guys no matter what DO NOT go negative (not that you are OP). Say the facts calmly and stop before you get emotional. I'm as guilty as anyone. But we all have to try our best. Sanders supporters and Biden supporters and everyone. Liz is the consensus choice. We need to represent that
In Bernie‚Äôs defense, I‚Äôve never heard him personally be a dick to supporters of other candidates. And isn‚Äôt sowing dissent between Democrats part of the [russian] influence campaign? I try to take this stuff, especially online, with a grain of salt.  Edit: forgot the word Russian
[removed]
I get the argument that you want to believe they're all bots, but I don't believe that if the view didn't represent his real supporters they wouldn't be drowned out fast.
Weird that all of these Russian/Republicans etc latch on only to Sanders and his supporters and no one else. Do they consider him as someone who cannot control his supporter's narrative? Do they consider his supporters more gullible? I have not seen such organized toxic narrative about other candidates in any other candidate's supporters. Whether you take Biden or Warren or Harris or anyone else's supporters
Nothing on the left is as bad as fascism, even Bernie's insufferable stans still want for a better future.
Her and everyone else was surprised how well Bernie was able to do against Clinton, but even with that the primary wasn't close.  Warren's endorsement was never going to change anything (would you change your support based on an AOC endorsement?), and if she cast her lot against Hillary that means not only hurting the nominee but throwing away her progressive influence on Clinton's expected presidency.    Remember, Warren had been able to convince then First Lady Clinton to get Bill to pull support for the bankruptcy bill in 1998.  She knew how to talk to her and could get her to move in good directions.  Maintaining that relationship would have been a real tangible benefit for progressive politics and not a trivial thing to toss aside.
Bernie was ***[MATHEMATICALLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHS-K7OuLAc)*** eliminated  **ONE MONTH** before Warren endorsed Hillary Clinton.  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/elizabeth-warren-endorse-clinton-rachel-maddow-show-n589236  Bernie had no chance of winning pledged delegates ONE MONTH before Warren endorsed Hillary, and that was 2 months before the convention.  https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/math-says-bernie-sanders-is-finished-222775    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_National_Convention
>Instead she played politics and tried to butter up Hillary for a possible spot in her administration.  No, she didn't. There is zero proof of this beyond her saying that she would have taken a VP role, and of course, she should have if it was offered to her.   >accepting money from corporate donors in the general election  She didn't say that. She said that she won't rule anything out right now.
The users obsessed with Hillary and talk about rigging, etc are definitely real people that are still bitter.   They say they're outraged that Warren is talking to Hillary and they try to pretend it's a secret that the two women are talking and they must be up to something nefarious.   I just tell them it would be really weird if they didn't talk. They're disappointed Hillary is not a pariah.
I dismiss them as trolls as they spread false and misleading information in order to sow division.
Well, they're doing Russia's work....
And she'll likely select a diverse running mate to draw in voters of color, so it's not like we need the Bernie-or-Busters anyhow.  Please pick Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum, Senator Warren!

FDR?
Not by a significant margin, but right now Liz is leading Bernie in Iowa.  https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/ia/iowa_democratic_presidential_caucus-6731.html
...No he's not. Iowa doesn't have enough polls to prove that conclusion, and New Hampshire is a tossup. Warren is doing quite well in California too, but even there we haven't seen enough polls. Either way, quit lying.
Not in a 50-state strategy. She's 545 delegates to 600 for Biden. Sanders has half the amount.
>  I'm concerned about enforceability and offshoring incentives   She's calling for a surge in IRS funding and shifting their priority to high-dollar fraud and evasion enforcement. The economists she worked with built a \~15% evasion rate into the proposal, and there's a 40% flat exit tax for anyone trying to expatriate their wealth.  In a world where the wealth tax makes it through Congress, these things do as well.
I guess, as president, she knows the tools available to her to crack down on it. Billionaires aren't invincible and her career is based on holding the elite class accountable.
Yes I‚Äôm implying that the 50% leadership vote allowed her to win just like a super delegate process . They won‚Äôt release the results of the individual results because it would show Bernie won the popular vote . But the subreddit is ok with that and allowed the narrative to be that 60% of all people voted for warren and that‚Äôs not the case.
The top post on the Sanders for President sub was telling everyone to vote and to vote only for Bernie. They were actively trying to circumvent the ranked choice voting system. It‚Äôs not against the rules, but it really annoyed me after I put Bernie on my list below Warren.
> like...... do these dudes understand they could have voted on this?  A lot of these people are the same ones who had trouble wrapping their heads around primary registration deadlines in 2016, so...
> There's a reason Warren's is being touted as the scarier of the two for the rich.  Sanders talks in terms that regular people get, but super rich people all either don't take seriously (i.e. it will never pass or will only be done in very watered down ways) or they think they can skirt around it all with fairly trivial estate planning or tax avoidance schemes.  Warren's gunning for them in the places that directly impact their ability to influence public policy or market dynamics. That's what scares them. It's not even about the money, it's about the fact that they'll have to confront fair competition. Business cultures based around monopoly or throwing their weight around to bully the little guys won't work anymore, and they are not prepared for it.
Or David "I condense Bernie's farts and drink them for dessert" Sirota.
Yes, true, I know this is a fringe of online activists and not a representative sample of his supporters. I don't blame him personally.  But, I still do agree with Yoga\_Fuego in a way. I supported Bernie in 2016, but I was not excited about him this cycle because I know how many of my friends who supported Clinton have hard feelings over the Class of 2016 Bernie Bros. FWIW I also know some Clinton people who were pretty obnoxious in their own right, but hey, she's not running again this time.  Point being, it's not Bernie's fault that his people act this way, but their actions still have consequences, and one of those consequences is that I have dozens of friends (mostly women) who I could never look in the eye and ask to support Bernie. If Warren hadn't run this time, I'd probably have backed Bernie quietly, but I would not have been willing to join the movement like I have with Warren.
Bernie doesn't have to personally be a dick to anyone when he's hired attack dogs like David Sirota and Briahna Joy Gray to be dicks for him. I suspect their nastiness to others on Twitter, etc is a feature, not a bug, for him.
My worst interactions with Bernie supporters have been in person. Friends I've known for 10+ years are calling me a corporatist sell out. One of them I don't speak to because he just became insufferable. Bernie has problematic followers both online and off.
He gets absolutely no credit when he keeps hiring them all as top advisors and letting their crybaby BS slide. He is totally culpable for all of it.
[removed]
>  I‚Äôve never heard him personally be a dick to supporters of other candidates.   I supported him on a personal integrity level until his terrible response to the Nevada caucus in 2016 and haven't looked back.
Weird that this sowing dissent part happens only with Sanders supporters and not with any other candidate's supporter. He doesn't need to be personally a dick, if everyone knows he won't lift a finger to stop his supporters spreading propaganda. If sowing dissent was so easy, supporters of every candidate would be equal dicks.
This part perplexes me. By all accounts, Sanders is a pretty fair-minded and stand up person/candidate - so why is it that a certain flavor of person is more attracted to his campaign than others?
>And isn‚Äôt sowing dissent between Democrats part of the \[russian\] influence campaign?  It is, which is why I was so troubled by it. It doesn't seem like Sanders really gets that he has some responsibility to keep that stuff pointed in the right direction. Or if he does, he has no idea how to do it.  Plenty of obnoxious Clintonites were around in 2016 too, but they're pretty quiet this time around from what I've seen, probably because they seem pretty split between Pete, Beto, and Harris so the toxicity is scattered out more.  I get that he wants to have a decentralized, people-powered movement. But part of that means being able to keep people on the same page and presenting their position well instead of alienating everyone who doesn't step in line by being petulant.
 This post was removed for violating Rule 4 (dividing Democrats)
I don't think that's true that the campaign of lies intended to divide Democrats only targets Sanders supporters.    They will and do target any candidate if they believe their actions will help re-elect Trump.  However, the Sanders supporter remains a good target of Russian/Republican lies because they already have the lies from the previous election to work with.
I disagree. The more either side goes to an extreme the more they look like the other and become hard to tell apart.
AOC: "Elizabeth Warren is a progressive lion, a champion for working families, and her commitment to inclusivity is exemplary. Thank you for being a role model." I propose we all put Lion emoji in our twitter handles/bios to show support for this lion of a woman. ü¶Åü¶Åü¶Å
^(don't read the replies :()
Doesn't it hurt that no big political figures endorsed her except for Castro and MA politicians? Today they're all singing her praises but couldn't have this come sooner???  I mean I know that the endorsement game started very late with Clyburn only 8 days ago (and then Klob, Pete, Beto), but why did so few powerful people (Gillibrand, Booker, Inslee, other senators, Connie Schultz) help her out when clearly they were in awe of her campaign?
AOC is great. I‚Äôm not going to judge her for her endorsement bc it‚Äôs a free country and she can support who she wants. I‚Äôll be with AOC all the way if she ever decides to run for President.
They look like Ewoks ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü¶Åü¶Åü¶Å
I don‚Äôt want to rage too hard at AOC but...  Sigh.  Could‚Äôve got behind the inclusive woman and we‚Äôd be in a different situation right now.
Contrast her with Ilhan. Thanks AOC.   I‚Äôm not happy that you went with Bernie, but I admire you. You saved his candidacy, carried it on your back, and that gives me hope for a progressive future that isn‚Äôt centered around Bernie.   Women have power.
I wonder how many of them have to stop from impulsively looking for the snake first...
You have only to look at the comments here to see what the "left" does to a woman they believe is loyal to a man (Bernie Sanders) vs. one they believe is not loyal to a man (Elizabeth Warren).  A flood of Bernie supporters coming to AOC's defense.  It's not about respect for women; it's respect for women who know their place.  Backing a man and loyal to a man.  These are not feminist values.  These are anti feminist values.  It shouldn't matter if a woman endorses or backs a man.  She should be judged in her own right.  That is not how these women are being judged.  Make no mistake about it, had AOC endorsed Warren; she would be called the "lying snake" they love to call Warren.  How is it that something so obvious not acknowledged?
AOC is the only prominent Bernie supporter with an ounce of common sense and coalition building ability... which is why other Bernie supporters (like the ‚Äúliberal case for Trump‚Äù clown) have attacked her.  https://i.imgur.com/ub3NYLZ.jpg  https://i.imgur.com/tMPN2i5.jpg
AOC is right! As usual.
I could get behind an AOC candidacy in the next several years. If Warren isn‚Äôt the badass progressive we didn‚Äôt get then I look forward to AOC.
AOC seems strong and smart enough to realize how dangerous the cult behavior has become to anyone not named Bernie. I really hope she can solidly distance herself from them in the future.
Don't you think that you could have sent this Tweet when she was being inundated with snake emojis AOC?  Now it just feels self serving.
AOC is the future of the party, I hope she is president one day.
I know, it still stings. An endorsement from AOC is going to go up there with one of those "What if" sentiments.    I know the media will try to make a story of this in the future to create drama for clickbait. But what's done is done and Warren and AOC are going to need each other in the battles ahead.
Token lion emojis.  Thanks?
Honestly it is tempting to be snarky but it's her own decision to support Bernie. She has agency. Perhaps she felt a degree of personal and ideological loyalty to the man and it's her good right. I do believe AOC (along with for example Ro Khanna) is missing some of Bernie's and many of his surrogates and supporters worst impulses.  She doesn't to build impossible ideological purity tests, dismiss everyone who doesn't meet them as murderers and basically burn bridges with everyone who doesn't agree with them. Her messages are positive and she is always keeping a door open for supporters who don't agree with her. And she seems to be out to reform the party rather than destroy it.  If being a #WarrenDemocrat becomes a thing I hope she and Ro will be a part of it.
ahem...sorry to butt in, but Lion sounds like Lying. (It was the designation for Ted Cruz when trump gave him the nickname "Lyin' Ted").  We can find a better feline. Perhaps a Tiger would be more apt?
Over the course of the campaign my respect for Sen. Warren has only gotten stronger, AOC not so much.
Being the ‚ÄúLion of the Senate‚Äù isn‚Äôt much of a compliment considering that the last person to hold that title was Ted Chapaquidic Kennedy
Her words ring hollow when she decided to endorse the 78 eight year old who had just had a heart attack. Completely changed the race and made consolidating around the only viable progressive impossible. Enjoy redistricting.
Can I use the lion emoji even though I am a guy?
[removed]
You'd think that Reddit with all it's anonymity would be worse, but somehow on Twitter, where people put their real name and face, people manage to be even more vile.
Always a good rule of thumb, unfortunately
Twitter is the worst.  Can't bring myself to use it.
I understand why she endorsed him, but I am disappointed.  This primary season made me question my support of "rockstar-esque" reps and senators. Not sure how I feel about it.   But, I guess the public loves it and that's what they vote for -- so I dunno üòê
I have my regrets.
It's literal cancer.
And why didn't NARAL / other pro-choice groups endorse? Why did Emily's list sit on the sidelines until Klob dropped out? It doesn't make any sense to wait until 1 woman is left. You're basically saying everyone else is just as good as the women for women's rights.   If in your eulogies you're saying this was historic and women can't ever win then do your part to elect a woman president. SMH
If NYT had solely endorsed her instead of splitting the endorsement it may have actually made an impact. But they decided to split the endorsement and no one took it seriously anymore.
It does hurt. I was disgusted by the too little too late endorser and resent those that sat on the sidelines altogether but are tweeting in support of her today. They can all take their "hot takes" and stuff it. We don't have a woman president because you sat on your hands when you could've had an impact. This is squarely on the Left and its leadership.
> Doesn't it hurt that no big political figures endorsed her except for Castro and MA politicians? Today they're all singing her praises but couldn't have this come sooner??  I think this is what the danger of trying to straddle the line between progressive and establishment results in. Progressives will endorse the most progressive candidate whilst establishmentarians endorse the most establishment candidate leaving Elizabeth awkwardly in the middle.
My theory is they all thought she was done by that point and didn't want to piss off the incoming administration. Definitely cowardly but not too surprising.
I think it's because Bloomberg and her poor performances in the primaries. People don't want to endorse someone in last place.
I would, depending on who the others were. If Ayanna Pressley is in the running, she‚Äôs got my vote locked and loaded, no doubt about it. But if it‚Äôs AOC as the progressive vs a bunch of others‚Äî yeah, I pick her.
Did she sent out a Tweet like this or take to task the Bernie supporters when Warren was being flooded with snake emojis?
From what I've seen of her on Twitter during the campaign, she's been nothing but supportive of both addresses. I understand why she's supported Bernie because she credits him for inspiring her to run for office.  Talib though....  Edit : my voice to text is racist  Tlaib  I meant Ilhan Omar, Tlaib as far as I know is wonderful.
I'll judge her for how she stood up for Warren when üêç happened.

Okay, don‚Äôt hate me .. what‚Äôs an Ewok?
Bernie has been a mentor to her and endorsed her campaign when she was running. No fault in returning the favor. She has been supportive of Warren on twitter throughout the campaign.
It‚Äôs okay. We can rage a little. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I keep thinking about when she endorsed Bernie, and that was really the tipping point from when we were solidly the front runner to the weird spiral around M4A funding into when we started declining. I love AOC, but I very often think what would have happened if she had endorsed Warren instead... Bernie had just had his heart surgery, and one of his worst debate performances and like all of the signs were pointing towards him getting out early.
Nah, I don't blame her for that. AOC and the DSA are much closer to Bernie ideologically than to Warren.
Exactly! If "she's a lion for working families" then why did you endorse the 77 year old socialist right after his heart attack. She's also made some dishonest digs at Warren. It's going to take some time for me not to be angry at her.
How dare she support someone she believed in right ?
And what did she get for it? Called a traitor when she had to acknowledge that Sanders hasn't done enough work on M4A. For just realizing that a slogan doesn't mean anything if you don't put a real plan in place behind it.  Same hate she's getting just for saying this about Warren.   Hope that endorsement was worth it to her.
I don‚Äôt  understand why people believe an AOC endorsement would have been such a big game changer?   Yes, AOC has a lot of support on social media, especially twitter, but Sanders online support outweighed Bidens by probably 10 to 1 and that didn‚Äôt really indicate much when it came primary time.   Also, almost every candidate AOC directly pushed for/endorsed outside of the presidency lost their races.   Outside of some news publicity, AOC hasn‚Äôt directly shown she can have a dig impact through her endorsements.
Bernie I think personally had a hand in her campaign, so she really didn't have much choice.  I respect her decision to be loyal.
Ilhan has made a similar statement: [Let‚Äôs not undersell the power of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs candidacy. She set the pace for policy on everything from disability justice to racial justice to a wealth tax. She is a giant of our movement. I can't wait for our progressive movement to build together. #ThankYouElizabeth](https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1235610537058349056)  As have Rashida and Ayanna.

Have you considered AOC just prefers Sanders to Warren?
I think Warren with AOC as a VP would be a killer ticket in 2024 if Bernard and his cronies could actually pull off a successful progressive presidency.
She's smarter than Bernie.  I dunno whether it is about youth or personality, but AOC at least has some flexibility and communication skills, Bernie just does his thing and expects everyone to come on board.  In that respect, I think she's more similar to Elizabeth.
She‚Äôs doing positive work in bringing the Bernie crowd to a more measured and positive energy. She does a lot of good in raising this movement and it will absolutely pay off in future elections.
Distance herself?  Dude   She's gonna talk soo much shit when she runs. Bernie doesn't talk shit.  AOC will.  Shes from the fucking Bronx. That's why us NYers love her.
If she wants a future in national politics... she needs to distance herself soon.  She has the intelligence and capability to be President one day. That has to start now though.
Thank you. Exactly what I think too.
gotta get some stuff passed in congress first though. So far she's all talk no implementation
AOC is incredibly intelligent and I do not think her decision was wavered by "personal or ideological loyalty." Of course, she probably does admire him, but she hasn't met him until recent years.   I don't think she's not aware of some Bernie's supporters sexism and racism as I'm sure virtually all young non-white people/ women on the internet are highly aware of racist and sexist attacks constantly. However, most young people are aware that it's been happening throughout their childhood, and that kind of vitriol permeates throughout our racist and sexist society and is often showcased on the internet. Bernie draws a lot of support from the young, working class, various races, and from various genders. It's frustrating when someone suggests that these supporters aren't aware that there are racist and sexist people on the internet because obviously it's a constantly lived experience.   As for your assessment of AOC, I would say that she's very ideologically consistent. She is reluctant to be compromised by special interests, and won't compromise her values in the efforts to make other's happy. She admits that certain positions she has taken and that calling herself a socialist will hinder her chance of becoming president, but she's not interested in thinking politically.   AOC endorsed Bernie Sanders likely because she believed in the movement and his ideology, which has been quite consistent since the 1960s. She has also spoken highly of Warren for her progressive politics and her efforts to help working families. These views are not exclusive. A lot of young people feel similarly. I would have preferred Warren to get the nomination because of age, debate performance, and certain ideas such as the wealth tax. However, it is a hard and important decision for many because it's the future of our country. Of course everyone feels differently, and I know you respect her agency, but I do not think she's missing obvious things.
Well, sometimes. My favorite Warren is "emasculate-Bloomberg-on-national-television-Warren." Those debates were so, soooooo satisfying.
"The Lady or the Tiger?"  Liz is 100% both.
That's ridiculous, she's praising her
I can totally see Warren running around Philly to Eye of the Tiger.
I see the Bernie brigaders are downvoting you. They think they own this sub and always have.
I‚Äôm having the same thought. AOC had a chance to support Warren when it mattered. She didn‚Äôt. Thanks but no thanks.
Yes
For the life of me I can't understand why anyone other than a public figure would want their real name / likeness attached to a twitter handle. Too much risk of the far right using it to harass you.
I think the voting system here helps, but only if the people in that subreddit aren't terrible.
people usually act more civil on reddit for fear of getting banned or downvoted. you'd have to say something really bad on twitter to get your acc banned, and usually the worst case scenario is getting blocked
You can't downvote on twitter. I think that helps since all tweets are treated equally
[removed]
The people who rated Klob equally worthy as Warren for simply being a woman candidate, like those idiots at the nytimes, are the sort who put the aesthetics of politics above the much more crucial differences in policy.  It's infuriating.
I think the real story is they knew she was the best choice but the elite consensus would never get behind her so they all hedged until it was too late.
>the left and its leadership  Particularly, the Democratic parties leadership deciding to let a guy *who hates the Democratic party* run in their primary.
I do think Ayanna is the best orator the Dems have right now by far. She invokes FDRs ghost when I listen to her. I think she could lock down the presidency if she were to run and voters weren't fearful.
It's honestly so refreshing to see how many strong progressive ladies that have been elected in the latest cycles. Makes America's future look less depressing.

Haha, what if that was AOC's game the whole time. She's not afraid to slide some nerd into her stuff lol.  The Ewoks were looked as jokes, but even the smallest warrior can make a difference.
Creature from Star Wars Return of the Jedi. Looks like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/4/4f/Wicket_RotJ.png/revision/latest?cb=20130622101905).
Prior to her own run for congress she was an organiser for Sanders during the 2016 Dem nomination campaign.  Given that mutual history the endorsement was not a surprise at all.
Imagine if she endorsed Warren back then.  We would be on our way
Our Revolution got her elected. She either felt like she had to or she actually had to endorse him.
My take is the she had to endorse Bernie cause that‚Äôs the position he puts female progressives in especially ones elected because he backed them. Like just look at the pushback Elizabeth got for not endorsing Bernie in 2016. Idk if I‚Äôm right, just thoughts.
[removed]
He invited her to his rally in Queens. Not sure if Warren ever acknowledged she existed.
[removed]
I actually don‚Äôt agree with this on AOC.  She gets intersectionality. Bernie doesn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs way more of a Warren Democrat than a Bernie Revolutionary.
AOC is a democratic socialist too though
I don't blame her for that. AOC and the DSA are much closer to Bernie ideologically than to Warren, and I wouldn't be surprised if AOC grew up idolizing Bernie.  It still hurts, because the timing of it killed most of the momentum that Warren had, but I still understand why she did it.
[removed]
We should listen to POC as long as they agree with everything I think.
Bernie notably didn't endorse her. I wish she were more loyal to the progressive movement than to just one guy.
Warren is officially the only woman and youngest Presidential candidate. She‚Äôs the only candidate who can appeal to both the progressive and moderate base of the party. Vote for Warren, she‚Äôs electable if you vote for her.
*Tulsi, polling at 1.3%*   ‚ÄúHey! What about me?‚Äù
I've been phone banking for Elizabeth Warren and even people who aren't planning to vote for her say, "Oh, I love Elizabeth Warren and be happy if she won the nomination."    She really is the unity candidate.
*Technically* Tulsi is still running so Liz isn't the youngest yet.
Please, please please consider volunteering. It's the real reason Warren is still in this thing. She has a strong showing of volunteers and I can tell you, it will make you feel better about life because you are actively doing something. It also makes your vote compound. If you convince 1 person you have 100% more effect on the election than someone who just voted and didn't volunteer. That's incredible!
I‚Äôm really hoping we don‚Äôt see a repeat of 2016. The party needs to unite behind a candidate who both wings would be happy with.
I don‚Äôt really consider Tulsi to be in this race, yes she‚Äôs technically still a candidate that hasn‚Äôt dropped out but she‚Äôs not statistically significant in any serious way.
If it isn't in the cards for Warren, what does everyone think about Warren as VP to either Sanders or Biden?    Just an FYI, I'm a strong Warren supporter; not a stealth Sanders or Biden supporter.  We get some of those trying to push her to drop out.  She should stay in as long as she chooses imo.
Being a woman doesn't matter. Warren is the /best/ candidate. Period. If all the candidates were women, she'd be the best. If all the candidates were men, she would be the best. As it stands, she is the best.  I may be a bit of an oddball because I don't care about "unity". We need to map out where our country is going and make it better for /everyone/. Warren is the person to do it. Period.
She's the only one who could realistically and healthily complete 2 terms.  By the time she's done with 2 terms she'd be....Bernie and Biden's age.  Sanders still hasn't released a health update after his heart attack less than 6 months ago.
So am I the odd one out that I think Warren is the best choice of the bunch but feel like I should rally around Sanders? If I vote for her, she gets more delegates but I don't see a path to victory for her. What is the benefit of Warren having more delegates? What does she get out of it? This is a serious question, and while I plan on voting for her tomorrow, I'm truly torn.
Tulsi is like ‚Äúnyet, I am hehre‚Äù
Man they are big mad that Warren is fighting until July.      OH WELL! They will deal.
Biden will lose for the same reasons Hillary lost. Resist the status quo.
Vote for Elizabeth, she has a plan!
Not gonna lie, I agree with all of this on paper, but what is the path forward for Warren if she can‚Äôt start winning some primaries? I‚Äôll probably still vote for her if she‚Äôs still running when the NY primary rolls around, but I‚Äôm struggling to understand her viability at this point.
I do wish Warren had moved slightly towards the center a little earlier. But I really do think it is her opportunity now to show that she is a better candidate than Bernie and Biden and especially Bloomberg.
Underestimate the forgotten tulsi majority at your own peril. Lmao  Also please prove me wrong. Im with biden to stop sanders. But if you guys can make it happen before april 28th. Ill do my part. Holding off early voting to see what happens
And tulsi gabbard
I hope she doesn't end up endorsing Sanders. She's so much the better of the two candidates.
As an undecided voter, I can tell you right away pulling the woman card followed by the age card is not wise. Furthermore she's a progressive, not moderate. This plea does not seem well guided IMHO
"*youngest Presidential Candidate*" means nothing if she's 70

My mom and brother live in a Super Tuesday state. Both like Warren a lot. My mom's a die-hard feminist, as am I, and we're both set on voting for Warren (although I have to wait until April...) but my brother insists on voting for Sanders because "there's no way Warren will win." We talk every night and I spent like an hour trying to convince him of exactly this: **she's electable if people vote for her.** (Didn't manage to accomplish much except getting so worked up that I almost started crying, but I tried.)  Ultimately, the only reason anyone is unelectable is because people don't vote for them, so the cure for this is to (gasp, what a shock) go out and vote for them!
I had some Warren supporters knock on my door this weekend and they also said she was the unity candidate. The confusing part to me is that she's pivoted from pushing policy to attacking her competition. Can you explain the unity concept to me?
Tulsi Gabbard is a woman (of color even) and almost half Warren's age. If we're uncomfortable with the media's erasure of Liz we shouldn't be doing the same to Tulsi.

Warren is now the anti establishment candidate.

There are trending to have warren endorse Bernie. Hmmm.... can‚Äôt help but wonder maybe election of this caliber should always be a choice between 2 old white dudes, with another old white dude billionaire tagging on for a little longer to keep it entertaining.
Honest question, what is her path at this point? Because I‚Äôm looking at polls and she‚Äôll be viable in a few states tomorrow but not nearly enough to get to the majority or even a plurality by Milwaukee.   After losing a bunch of primaries does she think the super delegates will think she‚Äôs the obvious choice? Because that‚Äôs what her latest speeches make it sound like. It happened fast, but after everyone dropped she‚Äôs on a very odd island now.

Tulsi: _Am I a joke to you?_
What is that woman's problem?  I mean, seriously?  We all know she's going to get a job on Fox News where she spends all of her time attacking the democratic party.
> **Vote for \[redacted\], she‚Äôs electable if you vote for her.**
"Wait, I'm still in this election?" Every time Tulsi sees the news and they mention her in the candidates still running. Apparently it is easy to run for president if you don't so anything.
I'm a bit surprised she's that high
I'm glad something like this is the top comment.
wow she gained a whole percent, you go tulsi
Smh, not even remembering Mosie Boyd.  #MOSIEBOYDORELECTION'SVOID
Yeah, I just convinced my dad to vote for her in Super Tuesday. He‚Äôs kind of a moderate and freaked out about Bernie, but he‚Äôs willing to go for Warren. People who are a bit more moderate trust her because she has been a democrat her whole time in office, doesn‚Äôt call herself a socialist, and is ambitious but ultimately pragmatic. People at work today were wondering why she doesn‚Äôt drop out to support Bernie as the mods just did to support Biden, but I think it‚Äôs smart for her to stay for now. First of all things change quickly and she still has a shot as the nominee (most Buttigieg supporters chose her as a second choice in polls), and secondly she can keep promoting progressive ideas to people who don‚Äôt listen to Bernie for whatever reason. If something happens to Joe we might be in a situation where a big number of people are very uncomfortable with both Bloomberg and Bernie, and she can capture some middle votes and make deals at the convention.
Exactly!  Warren is not winning because of a perceived "electability" argument.  But for some inexplicable reason, a 78 year old heart attack survivor democratic socialist and another candidate who is degenerating cognitively are more "electable" than the best prepared and the most qualified woman to ever run on the progressive side of aisle for president?  Do better America!
Yep, but then they follow it with "but you know I just don't think Americans, other terrible Americans and not me, are \*ready\* for a female president"

I see she's well liked, but the voters haven't really turned out for her consistently enough. I wish she ran in 2016, but Hilary/establishment would have tried to run her over. Sucks the race all of a sudden just got much thinner, but that might help her land more delegates. Hard to say with the quick dropouts by Pete and Amy. I have my vote tomorrow, but now I'm all in on strategy in the progressive lane since I had both tied for first.
With how much she is on Fox News I thought she was republican
Or the only woman
Tulsi doesn‚Äôt count
I don't count joke candidates.
Warren's volunteer game is ON POINT! There are so many volunteers that it's hard to give them all something to do sometimes! We're crushing it!
Yes I just got off a conference call with 3000 volunteers. Elizabeth got on there to give us a pep talk, it was lit
Is there any opportunity to send texts or emails for Elizabeth? I‚Äôm phone anxious.
Had Sanders and Biden not run; I'm convinced we would have a united party with a better candidate; be it Warren or one of the others.
2016 was a fluke, because Hillary Clinton was the presumptive heir after having abdicated to Obama in 2008. Sanders threw a wrench in the works. This election is very different. There were innumerable options and policy positions, and now we've winnowed it down to 3 (or 4) challengers. This narrowed field will not have the same dynamics as the first four primaries. Everything is shifting. We will be sorting the wheat from the chaff for the rest of March.
It's unavoidable. No one is going to get a majority of delegates.
That's because she's running to be a Fox News pundit, not president.
[removed]
Personally I would have major reservations about her accepting a VP spot with Biden. I also don‚Äôt think it happens. He needs either youth or  a person of color or both.
I could be happy with a Biden/Warren ticket. Not Sanders/Warren.
I‚Äôd rather have her as Senate Majority Leader or Secretary of Treasury than VP if she has to be in someone else‚Äôs administration instead of the head of her own.  I don‚Äôt think either of them would go for her as VP anyway, they both need somebody more than 8 years younger than they are.
I find these discussions pointless. We aren't campaign advisors nor can we vote or nominate VPs.
Governor of mass is a republican and could replace her with a republican senator
Her joining Biden would be really weird because he's completely the opposite of what she'd want to do. Biden is the corporate dem and that's the backing she's been fighting against forever. It would basically be a u-turn on her resume.
She might work well as a VP to Biden...but she might not. I don't see Sanders picking her.
She would be much more effective in the Senate.
Biden and Warren low-key despise each other.  Warren is wasted as a vice president, as well. Better for her to remain in the Senate.
Tough call, and vote your conscience. But the benefit is that her delegates + Bernie‚Äôs delegates outnumbers Biden‚Äôs delegates at a contested convention by a wider margin than Bernie‚Äôs delegates alone.   And she also does have a path if and when all the anti-Bernie and anti-Biden coalitions need to find an alternative.
If she has more delegates she‚Äôll have more of a say when it comes to writing the platform at the convention and getting concessions from the eventual nominee if it‚Äôs not her. Honestly, there‚Äôs a much better path to victory now that the field has winnowed so much than there was a couple of days ago. There‚Äôs still a lot of people who won‚Äôt want either Bernie or Biden and Warren can win those people over.   Finally, if you genuinely think that Warren is the best in the bunch then vote for her! Don‚Äôt psych yourself out.
I feel like I should rally AGAINST Sanders. So this is weird.   I find him as divisive as Trump. With Warren, there are plans. With Warren, there's a record. I don't know...I feel like I'm quickly becoming on the Biden train. Because if he has Kamala or Abrams as a VP...that's a selling point to me.   I think Warren is the best candidate. I'm ashamed at my fellow citizens for not realizing that. But we need to beat Trump. The ACA is up for another appeal in the SCOTUS. Come on! We can't do this for another four years.
I think that if Sanders wins the plurality, Warren would give him her delegates.  So I think it‚Äôs safe to vote for her in a state so that she does have delegates at the convention and a voice therein.
She's continuing in this primary in order to play kingmaker in the event of a contested convention (should nobody get a majority of delegates), and based on her endorsement of Clinton over Bernie in '16, I don't see her giving any delegates to anybody but Biden
Present
I honestly think Biden, Bernie, and Warren can all beat Trump. I also think all three could lose. But I'm pretty sure that of the three Warren would have by far the most effective presidency.
I'm actually pretty confident in the end we'll all rally behind the nominee. It's easy to complain about the candidates now, but when it's them or Trump, literally any of them look fantastic.
Bernie will lose for the same reasons McGovern and Corbyn lost.
[removed]
So you support Trump if Biden is the nominee?  Vote Blue No Matter Who; anyone who doesn't is a selfish asshat.
Amazing to me that no one else seems to realize this.
Exactly. And unfortunately Joe is not entirely with it. He's a gaffe machine and Trump's insult of 'sleepy joe' is unfortunately based in reality (for once).
4 states / 3% of delegates apportioned. 4 contenders left, 2 of which represent non-overlapping interests except for maybe beating Trump.
I think she can also make an age argument now during debates
I'm a centrist too, but about a month ago, I decided I completely believe in Warren's judgment and what she wants to get done for the people. She cares too much about people's livelihoods (evidenced by the amount of detail in her plans) to care about ideology over getting positive outcomes for the people. If centrist Democrats talk with Warren about their concerns about some of her plans, she will listen. And if she thinks their concerns are valid, then she'll change those plans. But first and foremost, her aim is not to herself or her ideology, it's to lift people out of poverty, financial insecurity, and hurtful discrimination. And that's why I'll stick behind her regardless of her whatever platform she has.
I mean she's absolutely a progressive. I just wish she'd focus more on her policies that have more mainstream appeal.
> I do wish Warren had moved slightly towards the center a little earlier  Moving towards the centre is what lost her ground to Bernie. If she moved to the centre earlier she would not have made it this far.

We‚Äôre talking about real candidates here
Only one who hasn't exceeded average life expectancy...
‚Äú‚Äòyoungest Presidential Candidate‚Äô means nothing if she‚Äôs 70‚Äù means nothing if you had no intention of voting for the Democratic nominee to begin with.
Wait til Wednesday before throwing in the towel.
At this moment, it's about unity versus division. Sanders and his base have run an incredibly divisive campaign. Which is why you're seeing this happen right now.
If leftists actually care about progressive policies becoming law they should vote for Warren.
no thanks.
[deleted]
Bernie also has a Super PAC...
Yes, Tulsi, you are.
Can I vote "present" on that?
ME: no, you're a republican.
President Warren will replace insecure voting systems with hand-marked paper ballots, require risk limiting audits, and mandate early voting and same-day registration in all federal elections.
In addition, if state elections follow the same rules, they can be fully funded by  the federal government, with a bonus for achieving high voter  turnout. Estimated cost: $20 billion, paid by closing loopholes in the estate tax.
YES! I have been waiting for a plan like this. I can't wait to read it!  (At work, Warren's plans are to long and dense for me to properly get through in the 3-5 minutes here and there throughout my day)
Thank heavens someone finally addressed election security.  It‚Äôs the biggest issue for me this election.
Our voting system is as insecure as our President.
Ranked Choice Voting, please!
Someone who actually cares about democracy üòç
Early vote > simply making election day a holiday
Great policy, I hope it could get unanimous Democratic support.
So glad for this. We need election security.
Um no . Paper ballets can be miscounted or thrown in the trash . This is regressive . We should move to voting with a app. Everyone has phones now and banking apps are secure .
Ms Warren isnt going to accomplish anything if the campaign money source dries up. Im frustrated because we cant give. What is her manager doing about this?
*estate tax not death tax, the term‚Äùdeath tax‚Äù was popularized to make people think the estate tax impacted them rather than those with millions at the time of death.
Looks like this one came out in June, but I agree, it's high time nonetheless that a candidate addressed this issue.
And what it will mean is, in 2022 we can finally have fair elections, take the Senate, and pass really progressive legislation.
r/funnyandsad
For those unaware of what electoral reforms such as RCV are and why they are needed, CGP Grey has some *great* videos on these topics in his series *Politics in the Animal Kingdom:*  1. [The Problems with First Past the Post Voting Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo&list=PLkLBH5Kzphe0Qu8mCW1Leef2xSxPK1FIe) (6.5 minutes) 2. [Instant Runoff Voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE&list=PLkLBH5Kzphe0Qu8mCW1Leef2xSxPK1FIe&index=2) (4.5 minutes) 3. [Single Transferable Vote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI&list=PLkLBH5Kzphe0Qu8mCW1Leef2xSxPK1FIe&index=3) (7 minutes) 4. [Mixed-Member Proportional Representation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT0I-sdoSXU&list=PLkLBH5Kzphe0Qu8mCW1Leef2xSxPK1FIe&index=7) (4.5 minutes)  The reforms presented here could significantly strengthen our democracy because they would ensure that your vote matters, that you don't have to give in to lesser-of-the-two-evils voting, and that you could genuinely make a difference in government even if you live in a safe/gerrymandered district.
That's in her plan too:     "Federal standards for federal elections. We have 8,000 election jurisdictions running elections. Problems with resources, malfeasance, and errors are rampant. No more. We will have federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, including mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. My plan will mean no more arbitrary voter purges. No more registration issues. And no more gerrymandering. We will also make Election Day a holiday to make it easier for people to get to the polls."
Make it election *week* and everyone has the right to a paid time off to vote. But still have a holiday for the last day of that week since many will procrastinate until the last minute. AND still have early voting available.
That‚Äôs not true at all.  Paper ballots are always watched by people with all different beliefs.  You would need people from both parties and independents to decide to throw them out.  On miscounting if they are miscounted it‚Äôs either by a small enough margin that it would not change the results or it is close enough for a recount.    It is impossible to securely vote on an app without removing anonymity.  When you bank on an app you have a username and password which link to your account.  With voting that would not be possible.  Also apps can be hacked or glitch way easier then paper can be.  With paper you know what is happening to your ballot.  Every way to cheat has already be tried and thwarted.  On an app who knows if your vote actually worked?  What if there were fake apps that pretended to be the real one and a bunch of people voted in the wrong one?  I have never seen anyone for non-paper ballots that actually knows anything about IT.  Not everything has to be constantly changing in order to be progressive.  Somethings are just proven to work and there is no point in changing them in order to be ‚Äòprogressive‚Äô.
It‚Äôs literally a tax imposed on you for dying.
If we don't take the Senate in 2020 we won't pass these laws.
I know, She‚Äôs the only one who I‚Äôve heard talk about EV.  I feel as though just making Election Day a holiday doesn‚Äôt do enough. Retail and other service industry workers would still have to work Election Day and I could honestly see it becoming another Memorial or Labor Day where companies capitalize off of the holiday with sales and whatnot. Early voting allows for these service industry workers to have 15 days to make it to the polls and that‚Äôs brilliant.
What do you care? You‚Äôre dead. You‚Äôve lived your whole life with that fortune until you die, in which accountants pay the tax from the estate which you are literally dead to.
... with millions of dollars you are choosing to not give away even after you don‚Äôt need it anymore.
Only if you are worth millions hence ‚Äúestate‚Äù tax.
>If we don't take the Senate in 2020 we won't pass these laws.  Until we take the Senate in 2022.  But in the meantime, there is a ton of executive actions she needs to take. She won't be doing nothing, even if she is stuck with a Senate that lets nothing through.
Not necessarily, I would think that insecure elections would fall under a grave threat to our national security and executive actions could be taken to defend them from enemies domestic and foreign.
A 2022 blue wave would be extremely unlikely. Americans have too short of memories
Good thing the Republicans care about national security and won't fight tooth and nail against this...  Good thing they didn't stack the courts with hyper partisan hacks...
Maybe you are right.  But I don't think you are. I don't think people have as short a memory as many would complain.   It is not that we have a short memory, it is that we remember different things individually. So when something big happens, that leaves a deep lasting impact on you, you feel supposed that it was not a deep impact on someone else.  For instance, I have been permanently changed by 2016 and on. But many people have not been changed, or the event that changed them happened prior to now and these new events does not affect them so deeply.  This permanent change that has happened to me has also happened to many others. Every new event will permanently change someone new.  But finally, even if I have overestimated the changes that have happened these past 4 years, I won't give up prior to even trying.  I am going to fight for 2020. Then, I am going to fight for 2022. Then I will fight for 2024. And so on.   I got one life. I am not planning on using it to give in to despair and cynicism.
What are the chances you would've fought in 2020 anyway? Not to discount your experience here, but most folks who say that would've been knocking on doors anyway, would have voted every time anyway. Most people aren't paying that close of attention and many won't get roused to action under a quiet president who isn't setting shit on fire. This is especially true in swing states.
I don't actually have to guess. I know what I would have done in 2020 had Trump not won as it would be a steady improvement from the previous years.  Obama Vs. McCain was the first election I was able to vote. I looked at it a little bit and my thoughts were "I can't tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. They both seem to have their pluses and minuses and both sides are generally trying to make things better."  When it was Obama Vs. Romney I did a bit more research than last time, but came to the same conclusion "Both sides are going to try and make things better, just in different ways. Either would be fine."  In 2014 I thought "I really need to start paying attention to the local stuff." But did not manage to that year.   In 2016, I learned quite a lot and formed a strong, well informed opinion. But I waited until after the primary as I was an Independent and did not think I was allowed to have an opinion on who the party picked.  In 2018, I learned a lot about the local and voted in my first local election.  Had Trump not been as awful as he has been (and more importantly, 194 House Republicans defending him unanimously throughout the entire process), I would be way less activated.   Only time will tell if I stay activated my whole life like I am saying. But I know for a fact that I would not be working during the primary had Trump not won, or he was less bad.
It sounds that even before Trump you were slowly becoming more political, which is pretty common. I really hate to throw water on your enthusiasm, but we heard the same stories from people after the Bush administration, and it went nowhere. Not only that, but Trump has given a whole generation of those manosphere assholes to the republican party.   The only way we can turn Trump into a party ending disaster is if we can demonstrate that our ideas actually work, and the only way that happens is if we win the Senate in 2020, discard the filibuster and pass some big fucking bills. Otherwise it's gonna be another few "both parties are the came" elections.
>really hate to throw water on your enthusiasm  No worries. Boundless optimism is exactly as useful as bottomless cynicism. We should all strive for a measure of reality. Throw as much water as you like.  >but we heard the same stories from people after the Bush administration  And I would say that those people **did** change. The country is a large, diverse place. People were activated and it turned into an Obama presidency. Then, having a black man I the White House activated many people who had not been politically active, that lead to a Trump win.  The people who changed due to Bush did not disappear, nor did their votes stop mattering just because Trump won. It just means that the road is a long one and it will have many pit stops, road blocks, and require some back tracking.  I am activated in a way that would not have happened had Trump not been so awful and the Republican party defended him. Yes, I was trending towards more and more action. But at what point would I have previously plateaued?   >we win the Senate in 2020, discard the filibuster and pass some big fucking bills.  I am 100% there with you. I'll work on that as if it is the only hope we have.  If we fail, then I'll work on 2022 as if it is the only hope we have.   If we fail, then I'll work on 2024 as if it is the only hope we have.  I have 60ish years of life in me. I am going to use them to the best of my ability. I see no reason to give in to despair or hopelessness and give up.   I don't need the results to match my desires. I just have to know that I am doing the best I can with what I currently know. Maybe my current strategy is not actually useful. But so what? It is the best strategy I currently know. When I learn of a better one, then I'll do that one. Until then, I will forget forward.
Finally got a selfie with Senator Warren!
So exciting! I love your shirt, by the way.

Warren reports $19.1 million in 2nd-quarter donations
This is GREAT news. People were getting concerned with the silence on these numbers. She is really gaining momentum in a seemingly sustainable fashion. Very excited by this.
TBH, I was getting nervous there for a bit. I expected with her recent rise some money would be coming in and there it is. If she can raise a similar amount next quarter I think that shows she has a core base of financial support similar to Sanders that can push her campaign all the way.
Hell yes. Chipping another 20
For reference, this puts her ahead of Harris and Sanders for the quarter but behind Biden and Buttigieg. However, only Bernie and her are avoiding courting big dollar donors, so it makes their hauls particularly impressive.
THIS IS HUGE! With her cash on hand from her senate campaign, and this huge haul Warren is very well positioned to keep her slow burn rise up through Iowa. She has a huge campaign there and needs money to keep it going and expand. This is SUCH good news!
Pure donations, no transfer over from senate campaign. I STILL WANT MY PERSONAL DONATION CALL, DAMN IT! (lol)
Yaaaaas! This is a strong data point confirming Warren‚Äôs campaign has solid momentum. And the fact that it‚Äôs all from small donors makes it particularly meaningful. A significant share of voters want a candidate who has solid plans for the country‚Äôs future.   Two things she was heavily criticized about ‚Äî small donor fundraising and being so heavily policy-driven are exactly the right prescription for voters tired of BS from both parties.
Pretty impressive. Q2 was very good for her.
I wasn't going to donate more in the primary, keeping my powder dry, so to speak, for the general.  When Biden came in, I felt compelled to donate a little more.  I would be OK canvassing for any of the candidates in the general, but I'm not sure I would for Biden.
This is my President
even i doubted that her grassroots abilities were stronger than bernie. this is amazing news.
Donate monthly and chipped in extra after the debate. I‚Äôm glad to see her going strong, I feel pretty defeatist about politics lately, but Liz would really change things up.   If we can deliver her a blue. Senate
Oh my! I was getting concerned since it felt like it was taking a while for the numbers to be released. But this is a solid number!
OMG OMG it's happening!!! NO BIG DONOR FUNDRAISERS BAYBEE. We a grassroots movement now gals and boys. EDubs is killing it.
Most individual donors for any campaign, PERIODT! I have been feeling very under the weather all day, and this was the news I needed to turn my Monday around! Team Warren!!
lol remember this? https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-campaign-fundraising/amp
Now even more people on the fence have a great reason to donate.
donated today. just rewatched a segment with her on ari melber's show when she announced her "break up big tech" plan. couldn't resist donating any longer.
I've donated a few times now, but I'm going to set up a monthly.  Was thinking 30 a month, but just realized my phone and my wife's phone are both about to be paid off, might put that money to Warren as well.
$19 million now makes me excited for when the big donor money comes in the general. It will help her get close to making the financial playing field fair against the hundreds of millions Trump/RNC have on hand
Phew I was getting worried about the silence  Perhaps the campaign team was waiting for a lull in the news to push this out after the other front runners posted theirs to capitalize on the news cycle. This is great news for Liz! Her team knows how to spend the money well   No offense to Buttigieg fans but he has been up and down courting big money from wealthy donors. I live in MA and heard about his thousand dollar a guest dinner in Nantucket or the Vineyard. Senator Warren has the smaller average donation and is the true grass roots candidate out of the two and she is doing almost just as well!
I think this is great, but I have significant worries about how divided the Democratic party is. These candidates need to put shit aside and unite. Biden is a clown and has no place in this race, for example. Bernie could use his influence to pass the torch. IDK what Buttigieg stands for. The partitioning of support will lose this election AGAIN. The right? It's all-in on Trump.
just another 1,981,999,000 to catch trump
Now that I'm thinking about it, I think this was all strategy. She was waiting for the top contenders (Biden, Sanders, Harris, and Buttigieg) to release their fundraising numbers before she release hers.
yeah, did we *all* just breathe a collective sigh of relief?
Do it, and don't forget to screenshot if you want the donor flair. :)
Me too!
So impressive. It‚Äôs her fundraising stance that got me to first donate and started the transition from Bernie to Liz. Really glad that it is paying off for her.
I head the Harris campaign got $2M after the debate, which means she only raised $10M for the rest of the quarter. I‚Äôm surprised at how underwhelming her campaign has been‚Äîshe was supposed to be a top-tier candidate, and so far it‚Äôs been one debate moment.
I donated her but honestly I don't care if there's big donors who are legally limited and have to disclose.  But I do agree that haul is FIRE.
she's gonna make it iowa at the VERY LEAST, so yes big news. If these become recurring donors, it's a big deal. I think her story resonants thus can convince ppl to be monthly donors.
Yes! And I want to win her contest and tell her about the dream I had where we ended up doing early intervention together with a toddler with autism. She might find me a little weird, but it was such a nice dream!
I WANT TO MEET BAILEY!
I just got a call from a MA number. I thought, could it be?  &#x200B;  No. Car Warranty scam.
I donated 2hra before they started giving out free stickers üòü
i mean considering how she did it, it is massively impressive.
Ditto. Wife and I were only planning on donating $x to her in the primary and then $2x to whoever in the general. We've already donated $6x to Warren. I'm on the verge of saying fuck it and donating all that we can afford right now just to ensure that she's the nominee and not Biden.
I will canvass for any of the current realistic candidates besides Biden. And it‚Äôs not that I wouldn‚Äôt prefer Biden to Trump. I obviously would and it‚Äôs not even close, but I just don‚Äôt think Biden will win and I don‚Äôt want to waste my time. It would also be hard for me to make a compelling case for him when I talk to people when I really don‚Äôt believe in him myself.
I thought Bernie had a million.
19.1 MILLION Baby! Take that stupid Vanity Fair!
Thank you for getting into the fight! :D
eh I mean don‚Äôt bankrupt yourself / deny yourself reasonable luxuries for the sake of a POTUS candidate
I've always done 5 a month for any candidate. It's not much, but its something.
2 billion,our side has 2 billion for the campaign..keep up
Agreed. I was thinking the same thing. Also it‚Äôs slow on the primary news front so it‚Äôs a perfect day to take the headlines.
I think you're right - and we know she's very good on strategy.
She was probably waiting until after the July 4 holiday when people would be paying a bit more attention.
I honestly think it may have just been making sure all of the numbers are right. There's no need to be first if something in your numbers isn't correct. They're being thorough.
Yep.   And I‚Äôm proud of every time I had a few bucks I just threw it in.   I‚Äôve never donated to a campaign before, but I feel like I can afford to with Warren - because if she wins I might not have to work until I‚Äôm 73 and die at my desk.
She's the only candidate I set up monthly donations for (though I like several) I did it primarily because her idea of completely ignoring large donors struck a chord with me. I'm glad I was not the only one.
Where do I show my screenshot??
if we donate at any point or if we donate via the reddit for warren link?
She and Bernie have the same fundraising stance, right?
Harris was planning that attack on Biden for weeks after he made that comment. I hope she keeps falling in the polls
It's less about there actually being big donors and more about what a candidate and campaign have to do to court those big donors. People don't just pop onto ActBlue and wire $2800. They're organizing big dumb dinners and parties where the candidates have to mingle with everyone and and all these big money donors get to have the ear of the candidate to voice their concerns. Like Warren says, that's time spent away from the people who you can help the most and will physically do the most to help your campaign on the ground.
I hear her Iowa staff is huge compared to everyone else. She is playing for keeps and she is smart enough to know the only way to win this is to win Iowa and NH. If she hasn't established herself before we move to the Southern primaries she will be easily picked off by Biden or Harris who have a more natural connection with AA voters that will dominate those primaries.
I like your dream!
She could have dinner party donation events like most candidates who do those for big donors but instead of going herself she just sends Bailey.
cuddles for donations! i approve
Where are they giving out stickers?
Yes indeed
I plan on maxing out for her in the primary and hopefully the general. That said, so not donate more than you can afford.   You can table for Warren, host a party, message friend and so much more. https://elizabethwarren.com/all-in-for-warren/
That's a good sign he won't win if he makes it to the general. I will vote for him if he does but damn I hope he doesn't.
Maybe it‚Äôs most donors specifically for this quarter, rather than over the entire campaign.
He had a million donations, not donors.
like other said, his for entirecampaign and donations. But it's also bernie had the mailing list from before, warren hasn't. So these new people signing on is VERY indicative of grassroots support.
Our girl Liz is such a smart campaigner. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Same. It‚Äôs not much ($3 a month), but I also donate larger amounts to her when I can afford to.
I'm going to set that up today üòÅ
Just message the mods. Also, happy cake day!
We'd prefer if you did it via Reddit for Warren, but it can be either way with the receipt. :)
Yep!
Harris has been rising in the polls, Biden has dropped a little bit.
as much as I love warren, she had the luxury of saying that b/c she rolled over $10 million first quarter that allowed her to set up in early states and get her name out there early on.  Other less well known candidates can't do that, so an average person can never run for president.  And while she doesn't have stop her current campaign fundraising route, I do think if she gets to general election, she'll be running against superpac money/billionaires of trump, she might have to adjust and I won't fault her for it. If she doesn't allow superpacs, she'll probably need those bigger donors in lieu of superpacs.
I meant she has enough money to get to iowa caucus next year. But yes she has had the staff there AGES ago.  What i am worried about his her support among poc, i hope to see that rise a lot more in the coming months. Her messages places REALLY well with immigrants and black voters.  And she's a GREAT messenger for it. Her townhall w/ a large black crowd, and her she the people forum performance was STELLAR.
She would too. Seems like just the thing she would find endearing.
He represents an important firewall against the appearance of corruption!
i'd go haha
And she raised all that money without the Purr-sist cat collars available on her store‚Äîthink of how many more millions she would have raised with cat collars! (/s. Seriously, great news.)
You're allowed to donate twice the maximum? Is that because it's in two different years?
I think they appreciate being able to forecast donations, so I think it helps even in small amounts.
‚ù§Ô∏è
okay I'm going to send you a screenshot of what I've donated so far and then I'll channel my "I'm angry about something so I'm going to give the campaign $10" donations through the reddit link
Seems weird to me that them having the same policy would be the impetus for shifting support in either direction.
That is true.  But she hasn‚Äôt been a prime target yet.  By the next round if debates, I would expect her history as a prosecutor brought up, and not in a positive light.
>she had the luxury  I mean, it was less of a luxury than a gamble. Her campaign finance director left because of the decision and she only made 6 million in the first quarter despite being the first 'major' candidate to announce. If her campaign hadn't gained traction yet or only gained traction after the debates like Harris' she could have been staring down another very low haul significantly hindering her chances in Iowa and from there probably losing the race. It's a decision that more than a few people believed would sink her campaign.   &#x200B;  Now, does she have more room to do that than a candidate like Gillibrand or Buttigieg who came in with very low name recognition? Sure, but that's only because she's already done the work previously. I don't blame people like Gillibrand and Harris going after that money but boy am I sure not impressed with Pete's numbers for that reason.
It's two different campaigns. I think. I planned to do the same for Bernie in 2016 but didn't get the chance.
Well, technically Liz was the first to come out strongly and publicly with the policy of no high dollar fundraisers. Bernie had a fundraiser in SF where the smallest ticket was $27 dollars, but the largest was $2800. She also calls small dollar donors individually, which I think it's pretty special.
> but boy am I sure not impressed with Pete's numbers for that reason.  I'll push back on this point. As a no name mayor who literally no one knew about 3 months ago out raising Biden the former VP of the most popular democrat? Even convincing ppl to donate? That's impressive. This isn't a Jeb Bush situation, who is a legacy. This is literally someone from middle of america, who hasn't been steeping in dc. He had some connections but to fundraise to the extent that Pete did, is mightly impressive.  disclosure: the bulk of my donations are to warren and pete  edit: but that's all i will say on the matter about Pete, don't like to mix my peas and carrots when on different subs

Elizabeth Warren overtakes Joe Biden as favorite to win Democratic Party's 2020 primary: U.K. bookmaker
Priority in the Primaries: Anybody but Biden  Priority in the General Election: Anybody but Trump.  A Warren/Sanders ticket would be my dream come true.
With joe flapping his gums with hits like ‚Äúmillennials complain too much‚Äù and ‚Äúa lot of trump supporters are nice people‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to be mean to corporations‚Äù. For someone like him who criticized the way Hillary ran her campaign, he certainly knows how to make it worse.
I like the both of these two, but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd have a place on the ticket that‚Äôs not President. If Warren doesn‚Äôt get the nomination, she‚Äôs better off in the Senate where she can impact legislation in a significant way. Ditto for Bernie.  The ideal running mate would probably be someone who‚Äôs less progressive and is popular in a swing or red state. Someone like O‚ÄôRourke or Castro comes to mind.
Warren/Sanders makes zero sense.  You either want the VP to enhance your electability or improve your ability to govern.  Sanders does neither.
Warren+Stacey Abrams would probably do really well in the polls tbh
I don‚Äôt get all the Biden hate. People act like he‚Äôs Mitt Romney or something, but his policies are solidly mainstream Democratic policies (and as is the case with basically all the candidates, are farther left than he‚Äôll actually be able to implement). He supposedly wanted Warren for his VP if he had decided to run in 16.
That's a very good point. A long-term Senator can get a lot of good stuff done.  Damn, now I'll have to re-thing my dream ticket.
Castro is a lock for VP if Warren wins. She‚Äôs giving out all the signs for it, and the attitude for his campaign is mirroring hers in a lot of ways. The optics of the both of them as a ticket are excellent and would supercharge turnout.
That's solid reasoning. You've changed my mind.
Warren Prez and Sandy Senate Majority Leader or vice versa is my dream team.
Abrams would be a good VP pick. She's popular in Georgia and would appeal to the black vote.
True, O'Rourke having (narrowly) lost the Senate race puts him in a good position for VP nom. Also as a young white guy from the south, he's like a perfect geographic and demographic balance for Warren.  That said, I do tend to believe nobody votes based on the Vice President candidate.
I lean towards Castro, honestly.
There are a lot of Bernie or bust people out there, some of which helped trump get elected by staying home or writing him in. Depending on his support, bernie may improve her turnout in the general election.
Yeah, I meant "dream ticket" in the sense of "If I could pick the President and VP of my dreams." I wasn't thinking about electability.
You're forgetting the number of people who are sexist.  Unfortunately, there are a not insignificant number of people who didn't vote for Hillary purely because she's a woman.
If Biden is the nominee then I'll vote for him over Trump, easily. But I'd much rather get out of this neoliberal rut of corporate bailouts, crumbling infrastructure, military interventions, militarized policing, anemic social services, and spineless, wishy-washy liberalism that delivers nothing but compromise with the GOP.
I‚Äôm more concerned about his cabinet. It‚Äôd be a bunch of Goldman Sachs alums. And I‚Äôm concerned about how he isn‚Äôt prepared to end the filibuster. Nothing would get done!
Biden's theory of politics is stuck in a time when things could actually get done through working across the aisle. It's like he spent his entire tenure as VP asleep and has no clue what McConnell has been up to.
Biden won‚Äôt actually fix anything. Obama really should have put his foot down and stopped him, but he probably was thinking about electability too.    I wish he wouldve just picked the candidate who wasnt Biden and just supported them. They wouldve shot up in the polls. Maybe he‚Äôll still do that
If Biden‚Äôs policies are meant to be considered ‚Äòfarther left‚Äô then they would be should he win, that is so much worse.
I think Bernie would be happy to see Elizabeth being President. She still holds a lot of progressive values, is a policy wonk, and I‚Äôm pretty sure they get along well. But the ideal running mate for her would probably be Castro. Hell, I think I read that one of Hillary‚Äôs considerations for VP was him. However, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that popular in Texas. I would like to say Beto, but I feel like he‚Äôs really generic and probably wouldn‚Äôt do well in a debate against Pence.
I personally would love Pete as VP. And that's simply because every fiber of me wants to see him debate Pence.
My thing is: how popular is Castro in Texas?
Yeah. I mean, she did help get the CFPB implemented, so with Bernie in office and ideally a Democratic senate involved, we could really see a lot of good done. Plus Bernie and her seem to have a good relationship, so I could easily see her influencing policy via Bernie.
Bottom line? Fuck Mitch McConnell. What a cartoonishly evil asshole.
I don't think either Warren or Sanders would be very good Majority Leaders. That position requires building consensus among the caucus, and both Warren and Sanders have been extremely critical of their colleagues at times and aren't exactly the type to 'make friends' just for the sake of it.  I'm hoping to see some combination of Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy in Senate Leadership next time we get a Democratic majority.
Abrams seems to be a common choice, and I remember she‚Äôd be open to pretty much anyone (minus Biden). Doesn‚Äôt Warren already do well with Black voters, though?
I feel conflicted on this because it depends on the candidate and the appeal they have. Warren could appeal to progressives while O‚ÄôRourke could appeal to more centrists in red states. Furthermore, you could argue that ideally, the VP is a balance to the main candidate. That means one is younger if the other is older and vice versa. One is more balanced in their views if the other isn‚Äôt. One appeals to candidates in swing/red states if the other isn‚Äôt. Beto is likable and he‚Äôs not as far left as Elizabeth. Also, Palin is believed to have impeded McCain‚Äôs campaign (though it could be argued that he was going to lose regardless because of how people rebuked Republicans because of the Bush years).   I guess if there ends up being a recession, it won‚Äôt matter who ends up being the nominee, though.
I think Warren and Beto are actually pretty similar, and I'd be super happy to see them run together. However, I do kind of think an all-white ticket, even if they're both very eloquent on matters of race, would be a bit of a step backwards.
Fuck those people. Essentially they're saying that Trump is their second choice after Bernie since them staying home/throwing a protest vote to Stein was a big part of why Trump won (and would be a big part of why he would win re-election if it were to happen again).
Ditto with Obama, but there's a counteracting "because she *is* a woman" vote, to some extent.  I think Hillary lost a little bit of the "will vote for any woman" vote for some reason, but doubt Warren would.  At worst, I think gender will be a break-even on votes.
I think those folks wouldnt have come out in the first place. They‚Äôre magnet‚Äôs Trump. Hillary‚Äôs support was actually really good in the D party, she just lost the EC. The only D‚Äôs she didnt perform as well with were black people(!) bc low turnout.    If they energize the black vote in the rust belt, theyll get it done
Those are two areas where there is a legit difference, and it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to learn more about. For the most part, I expect mainstream, well qualified picks like Obama had.   My incomplete understanding is that his plans are to get things through via budget reconciliation. You can do that once a year, so he‚Äôd have two opportunities before the midterms. He‚Äôd use one on healthcare expansion and the other on addressing climate change.   That is definitely a concern of mine. I dunno, though, if there were support among senators to do it if he would try to stop them. I think he‚Äôd more or less sign what a Democratic Congress have him. If he can get his major goals accomplished without getting rid of the filibuster, I can see why he‚Äôd want to.   But yeah, executive appointments and not attacking the filibuster (if we manage to win the senate) are the areas where I worry he might leave some money on the table, so to speak. OTOH, our best chance of getting policies implemented is to run up the score on election night and get more Democrats elected to the Senate and state offices. Currently he seems like a good bet for that, but that obviously a ways off so we don‚Äôt really know. But I think he appeals to the sorts of blue collar white folks who are over represented in the states we need to pick up and the suburban swing voters that won us back the house.
Idk I think that‚Äôs more of an electoral appeal than an actual expectation that McConnell will work with him much. I think (or at least hope) that it‚Äôs an appeal to the large number voters (particularly swing voters) who want less division and more cooperation. He‚Äôs trying to run as a uniter relative to Trump as the divider.   The key to getting anything done is getting as many people to vote for Democrats at every level. He‚Äôs very deliberately trying to win over swing voters, the sort of voters who voted R in 2016 then D in 2018 while also eating a little bit into Trump‚Äôs white blue collar base.   So it is a concern of mine that he might actually believe this rosy picture a bit too much, but I think it‚Äôs more of an aspirational appeal. But one thing I like a lot about Warren is she kinda cuts through the crap on that stuff. But I don‚Äôt begrudge Biden for it, and it might be the right call for trying to win back places like PA and helping our senate candidates in red states like TX, AL, and NC. But I‚Äôd sour on him if he convinces me he‚Äôs naive, but as of right now, I don‚Äôt think he is.
That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm saying that his agenda is farther left than a Democratic president is going to be able to implement.   Biden is the candidate who probably best represents where most Democrats stand, which is much farther left than where Republicans do. I don‚Äôt remember where I saw data on that but Nate Silver has talked about how Biden‚Äôs positions are closer to the average Democrat‚Äôs, it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt hear from those people on Twitter nearly as much. Unlike Warren and Sanders, he‚Äôs not trying to pull the party in a particular direction, just represent what Dems already want. That‚Äôs not particularly inspiring, but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a right winger or anything.
That's kind of my dream too. Castro might be a smarter choice, but I think Pete is a rising star and it would be great to have his young, inspiring persona alongside Warren's.   Taking things a bit further...  Kamala Harris as AG. Stacy Abrams head of the FEC.  Beto and Castro quite possibly cabinet positions as well.   But the big, impossible dream is I want Barack Hussein Obama to come out of retirement to be Secretary of State. And I want him to stare down Putin as we quick out more spies and sanction the fuck out them.   Bernie needs to command the senate. He stays there. He'll die in the senate. He'll be Warren's point person on all legislative priorities.
My dream is to have Pete as head of the DNC. There was a recent Daily episode that had Tom Perez talking about the recent gerrymandering Supreme Court Case and Perez's response to it was limp, at best.   What I've liked about Pete is his how he talks about things like DC statehood and changing the structure of the Supreme Court. He's talking about the longterm election strategy for the Democratic Party. He's unafraid to fight fire with fire and having someone actually push that at the party level is incredibly important. I want a DNC chair head that's willing to say things like, "They're going to call us socialists regardless" rather than cowing to the right wing news machine.   I think it's what Buttigieg is best suited for. And I'd like to see him run for head of the DNC in the future.
I don't see any chance of getting Texas either way.
Is she not open to Biden or was she just not interested in joining his campaign at that point!
> I guess if there ends up being a recession, it won‚Äôt matter who ends up being the nominee, though.  You mean the Dems would "automatically" win if the economy turns south? No, I really wouldn't assume that.
Excellent point.
>for some reason  Decades of Republican fearmongering and lies alongside Russian propaganda with a dash of help from Jim Comey.
I‚Äôd rather have Obama as AG than SoS. Foreign policy was the weakest part of his presidency
They say Texas is slowly turning blue ... but probably not fast enough for 2020.
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/darrensands/joe-biden-stacey-abrams-2020-rumors?__twitter_impression=true
Well, yeah.  I just didn't want to start "that discussion" with the people on the left who still believe the re-imagined history that Hillary was a horrible candidate whose sole reason winning was cheating.  It tends to take away from the actual discussion :)
That didn‚Äôt give me the impression that she ruled it out if he actually wins. The only real negative in there was one mad adviser.
Lol really? I will admit I glossed over it and was mainly referring to the Abrams adviser. I do however remember her speaking favorably of accepting the position if offered, though. My guess is that she'd most be willing to be Buttigieg's VP.
She's pretty presidential if you ask me. "Sen. Warren to ask Trump to deploy Army Corps of Engineers for coronavirus help"
She didn't miss a step after dropping out. She's still fighting the good fight. That's why I love her.
Where is everyone else? I know Brown and Booker and a few others have been out here proposing things, but it seems like Liz is doing the work of ten Senators.  Where‚Äôs Biden? Or Sanders? It seems to me that the easiest way to campaign and help Americans right now is to essentially operate a shadow government. Addresses, letters, plans...there‚Äôs no urgency from either.
I hate how she's pushing all these plans and not getting credit for it. See ["Schumer to Propose Additional $750B to Combat Coronavirus Pandemic"](https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-16/schumer-to-propose-additional-750b-to-combat-coronavirus-pandemic) üëà not a single mention of Warren in that article.
Honestly, I regret supporting Bernie over her. Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with Bernie. She‚Äôs just clearly was the better choice.
But she isn‚Äôt a man so....
It's awesome that she's at least getting a little credit for saving the country‚Äîit's too bad that she has to do it from the back seat. Imagine what would already be done if she was at the wheel...
I‚Äôve seen multiple people in other countries asking (rightfully) why this woman is not the president or even the nominee. It‚Äôs a good question.   I also would like her to ask the billionaires who were so opposed to her candidacy where they are in all this? Bezos is getting richer every second that we‚Äôre isolated, what is he doing for America? If Bloomberg is so f*ing patriotic that it was worth 700 million dollars to him to try to be president...what is he going to do for us with all his money now?
MADAM PRESIDENT.
Sorry the Army Corp is busy with the wall.
Too bad the Media completely wrote her off in favor for a dottering old man who will be friendly to Wall Street  Hopefully, Biden will choose her as his VP Pick
Creepy Ted Cruz behind her in the pic üòÇ
This is why I thought she was by far the best candidate. Too bad most people buy into bullshit things that don‚Äôt matter in governing like charisma and familiarity.
Re-draft Warren! The one person I trust to meet this crisis with understanding, decisiveness, and humility.
Is there any doubt if Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren were in the same room, but the smartest person would be Warren?
Maybe she can just elbow him out of the way.
You know what would make her even more presidential? People‚Äôs votes
What are the odds Biden chooses her as a running mate? It would be a great launching point for her to run for POTUS again in 4-years if she was Biden's VP, since we're only going to get one term with him anyway. (Presumably.)
I am a Yang supporter but love Warren and was so bummed that she dropped out. I was genuinely looking forward to voting for her. I really appreciate integrity, data, and realistic plans to bring about actual progress, and Warren was hands down one of the remaining candidates to check those boxes for me. I'm very thankful she's still working away for us, same as ever.
I'm sure on Thursday or Friday Trump will come on TV and Twitter to report all about his own plan of getting help from the Army Corps of Engineers to help out with this "Chinese Kung Flu"  Trump has no clue about what's happening unless someone else suggests it first. At least he is now just starting to listen to smart people and not Jared fucking Kushner, Gym Jordan, Matt Gaetz, and the idiots over at Fox News for a change.
She's pretty gutsy to go talk to Trump after all the shitty things he says about her.  I wouldn't be surprised if Trump just laughed in her face.
(The late Senator) "Paul Wellstone used to say he could use ten more progressives in the Senate -- ' or one Elizabeth Warren.'"     Just imagine how much could get DONE (not just talked about) with a President Warren. Sigh.
I know Yang is helping out with planning and advice on the UBI thing. He was my favorite candidate so he‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôm following.
Bernie has been talking about it. I have no idea what Joe Biden is doing.   Warren is being the best president a senator can be though.
we know she's doing it, and the work is getting done. for now that's enough, we have 4 years to make sure everyone learns who they have to thank for it.
Interesting. I'm a Warren supporter but would love to hear more substance behind this take. (Without just shitting on Bernie.)   I felt that way of course, but I haven't heard buyer's remorse from Bernie supporters before so just wondering what was the turning point for you, etc.
While this would be amazing, seriously amazing, and would ideally bridge the gap between Biden and Sanders voters nicely -- I suspect it would do the opposite. The BBs have been so vile to her, seeing her with Biden won't read as "she's coming on board to inject progressive ideas" so much as "hOw dArE sHe ChOsE hIm oVeR BeRNiE, I'm vOtINg TRUMP NOW."
His beard makes my beard sick
This is why I'm loathe to consider her for the VP slot.  She needs to be writing legislation, not sitting for photo ops with the Deputy Commerce Secretary of the Philippines.
Honestly Yang & Warren are pushing harder than just about anyone on how to handle all of this. Maybe like you said I‚Äôm not following others that I didn‚Äôt like as much, but I do see them and AOC acting as the vocal leaders right now.  While I hear a lot from Bernie, it seems to stick around his same talking points regardless of the virus. Just so happens his talking points sorta mesh well cause they were against the 1% & for universal healthcare.
Biden has been talking about it too. Warren's just doing more. Because of course she is.
It's just a pervasive, sexist trend embedded into society that men take credit for women's work.
I feel like Bernie doesn‚Äôt handle the bs of politicking as well as Warren does. Warren is able to explain her policies concisely. She‚Äôs witty. She‚Äôs charming. Her ability to smack someone down while making her point in a debate is breathtaking. She would be a better president.   Bernie isn‚Äôt handling being asked the same wrong questions over and over. Again, not shitting on Bernie. Unfortunately what I liked about Bernie is what‚Äôs killing him right now.   I‚Äôm still holding out hope that whoever gets the nom taps her for VP. I need warren in the White House in some capacity.
I'm someone who was 1a Warren/1b. I voted Bernie, but I knew it was over by CA/ Super Tuesday for Liz so I voted Bernie to push him over the top. I think Liz is better at her delivery. Their policy is nearly the same, but the tone is what makes a difference. My mom loved Warren, but disliked Bernie. She's in the older 60+ bucket. I tried to tell my mom when she was voting for Biden in CA that Liz and Bernie had basically the same policy, but he lost her on being too aggressive on the messaging. That's where Liz was a bit better.   But Liz kind of fell off with people who jumped to Bernie because she kind of didn't stick to her guns on M4A and that's where she seemed to see a drop in support from people who liked both.  Even though I voted Bernie in CA primary, I still wish we could have flipped the positions going into the Super Tuesday/CA primary.
You also have to wonder how many of those types of BB's are actually Russian trolls
They'll try, but we can't let them drown out the majority.
VP can be a big role. Biden himself played a very important role in the Obama administration. I think Warren could be way more effective as VP than senate. You can‚Äôt put her in the box. I bet she could do all the work of both Senator AND VP.
I don‚Äôt know, she‚Äôs already got her selfie game down and it didn‚Äôt seem to slow her down any. I feel she is already trained for that VP duty.
It would make her potus in 2024
We were ROBBED of a Warren/Yang ticket
Yes. But I'd rather actual things getting done, than everyone flailing about uselessly. Thank god Warren is doing the leg work.
Biggest thing I noticed in the debates was warren gave excellent in depth answers and Bernie often rehashed his stump speech. Unfortunately stumping is good at getting people excited without going into details on anything. I also think warren may have sounded too professor-ish to some people. I loved listening to her, it felt like I was going to class on us politics. But I think some people didn‚Äôt like feeling like they were being taught.       The biggest issue with warrens campaign was the sexist view that men run on potential while women have to run on accomplishments. Warren had both but nobody seemed to give her the latter. Glad I got to vote for her though, it was not a wasted vote no matter what sanders supporters try to tell you. And her book, ‚Äúthe two income trap‚Äù is a good read as well.
> she‚Äôs charming  I like Warren, but that‚Äôs a bit of a stretch. I don‚Äôt even think Sanders is charming. Obama was, but I disagreed with some of his policies.
Hopefully all, but I doubt it.
Yup, and once they get this shit under control everyone else is gonna try to swoop in and take credit.
I don‚Äôt believe in wasted votes. Particularly in primaries. It‚Äôs the only way we have of letting the dnc know what the people want. The more vote for progressive candidates and the more progressive candidates the better.
Watch Liz in a South Carolina bar with Colbert and then tell me she‚Äôs not charming
Agreed. When Bernie and sanders got their early leads, a lot of reddit comments were asking for collecting votes to the front runners, instead of voting for the candidate you want to win. I had to politely tell a lot of people that I was voting for the candidate I thought would make the best president, not the one with the best chance of winning.
I saw it when it was broadcasted. She‚Äôs not charming...
Warren: "We will make Election Day a national holiday, and all federal elections will have a minimum of 15 days of early voting"
How come I don't hear any proposals from Republicans on how to encourage political participation by the public?
I have not found one thing that Warren proposes that *doesn't* make sense.
Voting by mail is so much better. Washington state had a voter turnout of 78% in the 2016 general ([source](https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/voter-turnout-by-election.aspx)), compared to the national turnout of 55%.
When you say these out loud, it sounds kind of crazy that this isn't the norm already. The average person should support this.
I fucking love this plan. Sorry for my language. But really though.
It‚Äôs a great idea, Andrew Yang has had this as one of his policies as well: https://www.yang2020.com/policies/election-day-holiday/
Don't stop there. Include the primaries.  I had three midterms on the day I was set to choose Clinton or Sanders and it was not lost on me that the Massachusetts student population was firmly in the Sanders camp at that time.  I desperately studied every second of the day in fear of grades and fully admit that I did not vote. Sanders lost Massachusetts narrowly.
Damn straight. No more voter suppression.
Don't get me wrong, I'd love a holiday, but is it really going to improve things much?  Poorer people usually have to work holidays. How long until we get "election day" sales?   White-color people already get time off to vote.   I do love the extended voting, though.
Why no Ranked Choice Voting?? She spoke well of it on the Ezra Klein Show
"I don't want everybody to vote" (Goo Goo)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GBAsFwPglw
Can the executive branch do this without the legislative branch's support?
That's why I like her so much. Her policies are very detailed and thorough.
I want all paper, all nation wide.
I love this idea! However I wish it helped low income voters, anyone working in retail, restaurants, ect. wouldn‚Äôt benefit from it unfortunately :/ we‚Äôre open every day except Christmas!
If she insists...I guess those of us in rational states that vote by mail will just hang out on the couch all day and binge-watch something.
I know you're asking this rhetorically, but, it's because they don't want more people voting. They want their crowd of old people to show up and for everyone else to stay at home.
My grandma just shared on Facebook a cute meme that said if we abolish the electoral college, then California & New York will elect a democratic POTUS for the rest of our lives.  That's truly what they believe. A Democratic president is that scary to them. I don't get it.
Because 'democracy' doesn't mean what you think it means, according to them.
Remind me again how we get rid of the electoral college without a constitutional amendment?
I love all her ideas except the wealth tax  How will the government know someone‚Äôs worth? Go into their house and evaluate their items?
They do vote-by-mail in Utah too. I‚Äôve missed that since moving away. It‚Äôs the best way to vote
The more the merrier. Election day should be a standard view, at least among Dems.
If it helps, narrow losses are generally only meaningful symbolically, as the delegates are split proportionately.  Clinton got a whopping 1 more delegate than Sanders.
I'm okay with an Election Day holiday as part of a package that also includes vote-by-mail and early voting. Agree it doesn't do much in isolation.
> White-color people already get time off to vote.   They do?
Your points are valid. As to the question of: "is it really going to improve things much?" Only one way to find out.
Sadly, this is the most accurate answer. Even the ones who might be somewhat supportive of the idea aren't willing to speak up against the majority, who are perfectly happy to keep obstacles in the way of certain... *demographics* voting. When suppression of a certain class of voters has been such a common practice, nobody is going to bring it up.
California and New York only have 18% of the population combined. Also, if the vast majority of people happened to live in two states, it would make sense for those states to dominate politics. The majority of the population should be making decisions, not the minority.
Please remind her that eliminating the EC will actually get *more Republicans* to vote in those two places.
It's a republic! /s
Not so much get rid of it as render it moot: [the National Popular Vote Interstate compact](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation).
No need to remind you, obviously.
Appoint justices who call it unconstitutional. Or just use an interstate compact. Or just do the constitutional amendment. They just seem insurmountable because everyone keeps saying they are. One guy passed a constitutional amendment by himself in the 90s just to prove a professor wrong. It just takes some effort.
Most wealth is in the form of real estate (already valued), stocks and bonds (already valued), and private businesses (can be estimated).  The stuff you hang on your walls is largely noise, though particularly valuable pieces could be tracked and updated for inflation.  Beyond that, all of this stuff already has to be valued when someone passes and its bequeathed to someone else.  It would just have to happen more frequently.

It does bring attention to voting, so that's a plus. At least some people will eventually get time-and-a-half out of it?
Freudian slip? I‚Äôm assuming they meant ‚Äúcollar‚Äù but...
Many companies will let you leave to vote. Usually the higher your pay, the more likely.
Dude your username, wtf
Not to mention that California's and New York's registered voters include 5.2 and 2.6 million republicans, respectively.  Those are *also* people whose votes don't count.  Abolishing the electoral college would make *every* state more purple.
I commented back with this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k) and she deleted her post shortly after. Lol! Sorry Gram. Facts are facts.
> California and New York  It‚Äôs also funny that she just skipped over the second and third most populous states, Texas and Florida, to only discuss Cali and NY.
Ah yes, the NPVIC. What do you think of the Nate Silver argument, though, [that it‚Äôll likely never be passed by enough red or battleground states](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-plan-to-circumvent-the-electoral-college-is-probably-doomed/)? Seems like Warren can‚Äôt do much other than use the bully pulpit to try and encourage state governments to pass it. Which would be a fine effort, sure, I just hope she‚Äôd remember to fight for it when the rest of her agenda is so enormous, and when the states are so opposed to giving away their power to effectively choose each president
Remind, maybe not. Explain, though, I would appreciate
That was the last amendment that was ratified, and it was only possible because there were a lot of states that had ratified it back in the 1700s and 1800s before that student found out about it and launched a movement to get a few more states onboard. The 3/4ths of states ratification requirement is nigh-impossible in our age of extreme polarization. Look at the WolfPAC amendment to get money out of politics, it‚Äôs had tens of thousands of volunteers working on it, the issue has bipartisan appeal, but they‚Äôve been at it for 8 years and only five states have ratified it! It‚Äôs way tough  Also, since the electoral college is explicitly detailed in the US constitution, you can‚Äôt exactly appoint judges to call it unconstitutional... there‚Äôs no argument that could be justified, and if the SC did strike it down it would be unprecedented and perhaps open the flood gates for other very radical moves by the SC. Which might be nice! In some ways. The Constitution ain‚Äôt perfect after all. But I can‚Äôt imagine a decision that would radicalize the rightwing more, than basically tearing up the founding document of our country.  As for the interstate compact, it‚Äôs more possible, but read that article by Nate Silver. It‚Äôs very difficult to get non-blue states on board.
Plus well-off people are more likely to live in areas that are well-served by polling places, making it less of a burden to the employer to allow them time to vote.
In my state they‚Äôre required to let you leave to vote, doesn‚Äôt matter what your pay is. But only if you actually work the entire time the polls are open which few people do, it‚Äôs more than 12 hours.
It's AMA. You have to ask a question.
It's a 4 year old account maybe they made it when they were 15 or something.
Yep. California has 4.7 million registered Republican voters. All those voters get effectively counted as Democrats in every Presidential election.  Why is this okay? It's not fair, it reduces Republican turnout statewide (for down-ballot elections), and it makes people feel like their vote doesn't matter.  This is true in *every* non-swing state. So all but about \~12 or so states. Texas should be a major Democrat stronghold. California and New York should be major Republican strongholds.  And the electoral college actually makes rural low-population states *ultimately* irrelevant in politics.  Why would ***anyone*** ever visit Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Kansas, Utah, Oklahoma, or literally any states in the south (except Florida) etc etc? Their vote is a foregone conclusion. They will always vote for the Republican Party. Nobody has to care that these states exist. Nobody has to visit them.  * In 2008, only 7 of the smallest 25 states received any attention in the presidential election: the swing states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada all got plenty of attention. So did New Mexico (still a swing state at the time). WV and DC both received 1 event each. * In 2016, only 9 of the smallest 25 states received any attention in the presidential election. Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada again (the swing states). Maine and Nebraska also got a little attention too, crucially, **because these are the only 2 states that proportionally split their delegates** instead of awarding them winner-take-all. New Mexico also got some events because ex-Governor Johnson was running on the Libertarian ticket. Utah got a little attention too because McMullin was running. (Neither of these last 2 states got major party attention except to ward off third parties). Connecticut and Mississippi also got 1 event each.
It's a solid argument, but it kind of assumes that voters will only ever vote for the most tactically advantageous choice, meanwhile, Florida, which elected Republicans in statewide elections in 2018, also voted overwhelmingly to reinstate voting rights for felons.  I can see a populous red state also voting for it because they agree that they're not getting enough attention, or a purple state going just blue enough to join (like Colorado did).
What's to explain? Clarify your question.
Honestly, with the lines in some areas (esp neighborhoods of color and low income) it should be if you work like 6-8+ hours that day...
Wtf is a question technically
Agree with everything you said, but, even though my dad would disagree, North Carolina and Virginia are in the South.
So, you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs good that rural states are ignored?? Shit, man, I‚Äôm from Utah and there a lot of fantastic communities of Democrats over there, especially in Salt Lake Valley, Park City, and down in the Navajo res
Umm... someone already beat you to the punch. But, the question was basically this: what is Warren‚Äôs strategy to get rid of the impact of electoral college on our presidential elections seeing as it‚Äôs unlikely a constitutional amendment could be passed to do so.
Touche. You win.
Not sure how you got that from my comment. I'm saying they're *already* being ignored. The electoral college means only *swing states* are relevant in elections, regardless of their population.  Under the electoral college, both Florida (high population) and New Hampshire (low population) are relevant in elections because they are both swing states. But all of: Texas (Republican, high population), Wyoming (Republican, low population), California (Democrat, high population),  Vermont (Democrat, low population) are irrelevant in elections because they're not swing states.  Under the electoral college, 38 or so states are irrelevant in Presidential elections. This suppresses voter turnout and down-ballot elections in every single one of these states.  It's not about urban/rural or high population/low population. It's about political leaning. The status quo is that only states with roughly equivalent Democrat and Republican support matter. This provides tangible benefits to these states, and disenfranchises every other states; as well as minority-party members in every non-swing state. Republicans in California and Democrats in Nebraska all have to ask themselves if their vote really matters (in the presidential race, no it does not). That's a crappy status quo.
Not so fast. There's no question mark at the end to signal the author's intent to ask a question. In this case it appears to be a statement of exclamation rather than a question.
Elizabeth Warren leads field in new Iowa poll!
You can read from the pollster directly [here](http://www.focusonruralamerica.com/2019/07/03/july-2019-poll-results/)   Warren is in the lead with 20% followed by Harris at 18% and Biden at 17%. Sanders is at 12%. This is the best place this race has been in since it started.  EDIT:  Just to add some context here. Warren is up 12 points from March. Her favorability is a whopping 88% the highest in the field by far and continuously rising.  The important thing this poll shows is that Biden is a weak frontrunner not a strong one. This means this primary is shaping up to be more like 2008 than 2016. I think it'll likely boil down to Biden vs. Warren. Harris may be temporarily buoyed by an overperformance in South Carolina but I think it's very likely she will lose California to Warren at which point she will probably drop out. I don't expect Sanders to last if he loses NH to Warren. Things are looking good for Team Warren!
I am with Nate Silver on this issue:  Biden, Harris and Warren seem to jockey for top 3 spots depending on the poll for these first states and he is placing all 3 into his "tier 1" group.  Even though Warren is my #1-100 pick, I am happy that with Biden sinking, we're probably looking at a Warren or Harris nomination
It's interesting how Joe Biden was in the lead until he started to talk.
I so hope Warren gets the office.
i was honestly worried about her several weeks ago (hence rushed to donate) but honestly after the media narrative shifted post she the people forum, she steadily rose.
Anyone else get the Delaney ad targeted towards them in this article? So strange.  Anyways, love this news.
IT'S HAPPENING
I'm a bit sad Bernie is doing so poorly, but at the same time I'm happy for Warren, and happier still to see Biden going down.
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   Caucus: February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
lol Sanders is tanking
Am I missing something, or is Harris getting all this attention just because of a few sharp attacks during the debate?
Yes! I can see why Warren would do well there. 1, strong ground same, 2, a bit of Midwestern charm, and 3, progressive (and Iowa caucus goers tend to be more dedicated, given how it's kind of an ordeal to vote in the caucus). Which will certainly help her in NH, where she'll have an advantage along with Bernie. This is so exciting! As long as she's improved her fundraising status, she's in a fantastic position!
Harris's home state is CA I believe
I'm rooting for Warren, but I wouldn't rule out Bernie or Buttigieg. I think Biden will continue to tank, and Pete seems to be a natural go-to for moderates (given Beto's decline), and Bernie seems like a natural for Biden supporters who picked Biden based on name recognition alone.  I think Harris's debate bump will fade with time, but at this time, I'd say Biden, Bernie, Warren, Harris, and Pete are top tier. Booker and Tulsi could still improve. I think the rest are done-so.  I really thought Castro would get a bump out of the debate. The fact that he didn't means his campaign probably doesn't have legs.
I wouldn't rule out Pete or Bernie...we don't know where all of Biden's voters will go. Maybe Pete will pull a hail Mary pass and save race relations in South Bend and the black support will rally behind him
I guess one important question is who picks up Bidens votes. I'd imagine the bulk of those votes will go to Harris (the African American vote and the more centrist vote) so the best thing for Warren is for Biden to stick around as long as possible.
That is so ridiculously spot on.
Well said!
That has been my prediction on Biden, however now I am afraid people are eagerly writing him off and underestimating the power of the establishment and their desperation to support a centrist candidate.
That She The People forum was huge though it doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough.
I'm still wondering why she hasn't released her Q2 numbers. I donated for the first and only time this cycle to her and I'm nervous to see if she made any money
I thought it was funny that the quote wasn't attributed to anyone.
Can we get an "It happening!!!" GIF but instead of Ron   Paul we have Elizabeth Warren dancing with the rainbow feather boa?
Bernie hired all the wrong people for his campaign. Sirota should not be within 500 feet of a campaign that wants to win.
That, and also because people are envisioning her making a fool of Trump on the debate stage. Not saying I personally feel that (I think he will refuse to debate at all) but that's I think a lot of it.
I mean, I like her policy on increasing teacher salary and increasing funding for poorer districts. And she's cosponsored some helpful bills in the Senate, like [this one on reducing black maternal mortality rate](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-reintroduces-bill-to-reduce-maternal-mortality-rate-among-black-women/). But I think the attention is mostly due to her busing comment against Biden.
I think so, you know how media loves drama. She successfully launched an attack that damaged the front runner in what was the most contentious and dramatic moment of either debate. They eat that shit up. And then, outside of that moment, she did alright.   But from my perspective, it was the typical all-too manufactured performance I expect from politicians, polished though she was. I thought Warren gave better answers than Harris on the first night, and same with Buttigieg on the second.
That, and also because people are envisioning her making a fool of Trump on the debate stage. Not saying I personally feel that (I think he will refuse to debate at all) but that's I think a lot of it.
She grew up in Oklahoma.  She knows how to be real with the farming communities and rural voters.  I think Harris will be on the ticket no matter what.
Yep, but home state advantage is fairly diluted nowadays and Warren has overtaken her in polling there.
I think you can safely rule out Buttigieg. I don‚Äôt see how he can be top tier when he hasn‚Äôt hit double digits in a single poll and the other candidates are doing it consistently.
Buttigieg seems to be running for VP. His attacks in the debate were tailor made to go after Pence.
Where does Pete get a win though? He needs Iowa and is a non-factor there so far. He‚Äôs got a puncher‚Äôs chance in NH and no chance in NV and SC
Bernie has a clear ceiling (among other things, look at his unfavorables) & has zero way to win a Democratic nomination at the convention floor (save getting close enough to 50% that they have to give it to him).  He also isn't a coalition builder in a primary that is built for coalition building.   Buttigieg is the mayor of a town of 100, 000 and has no national political experience.  Nor are his polls going in the right direction now that the bigger names are taking the stage.  I don't think either have a real shot.  If we're talking about chances to win the nomination, I'd put the longshots of Booker, Castro, and Klobuchar above either Sanders or Buttigieg, as unpopular as that opinion may be.
I HIGHLY doubt that. But I'm only one black voter from the south.
Haha, the only way black support improves with Pete is if he finally finishes that "investigation" and fires the racist cop.
Bulk of those votes come from the "electability" crowd so Warren can take them with some effort.
They will jump to Harris or Buttigieg.
i always mention it to friends to tell them to watch it if they're already inclined to support warren. I definitely noticed a tonal shift after that event.
I have a feeling it will be low compared to the other competitive candidates. She isn‚Äôt focused on fundraising, she‚Äôs intentionally freezing out big donors, and she doesn‚Äôt have Bernie‚Äôs grassroots army. I just hope it‚Äôs enough for her to avoid falling behind while the others ramp up their field operations.
Probably would look bad if Delaney attributed the quote to himself.
Faiz Shakir is supposed to be an excellent campaign manager, but unfortunately for him I'd guess he has an entire binder dedicated to damage control whenever David Sirota fucks up on Twitter.
Trump will definitely debate. He craves attention. He might whine and try to rig it, but he will debate.
I think liberals have fantasies of using Aaron Sorkin speeches to dress down republicans and expose them as hypocrites, but it only really works on other liberals with whom we share the same values.
I'm a bit concerned with how Warren would do in a sharp debate against Harris. Warren is composed and calm, but the first debate was relatively tame in terms of having anyone going after her.
[deleted]
While Warren-Harris would be awesome, i kinda want Harris in the Senate. She asks such great questions.
he raised 25m in the past quarter, that's pretty insane.
[deleted]
I'm in Iowa. I think he could win here. He's a lot of people's second or third choice, and I think people could drift to him if their main candidate tanks. If he pulls off a second or third place in Iowa and takes NH, his prospects would change. He's an underdog for sure, but I wouldn't rule him out. He's no Tim Ryan or Eric Swalwell tier candidate.
How is 10% a non-factor this early lol what. Iowa (and the race as a whole) is a tossup between the top 5 candidates at this early point, and any thought otherwise when candidates are swinging double digit points from a single debate is crazy  edit: spelling
it's called a hail Mary since it has almost no chance of happening
That's a good point. I don't know if they are the bulk (I'm not disputing what your are saying, I've just not looked into it) nevertheless, you are right that Warren can capture that portion fairly easily.
i'm hoping her network comes thru. She had a sizeable one during senatorial campaign and bigger one now.   her taking photos and calling back might help build recurring donors
that's the fear. I gave what I could but I'm worried her campaign could get bled dry once her senate war chest goes away.
It's all a warm up for how they deal with Trump.
>poorly executed cheap shots at Biden  What? Whether you agree with her strategy of bringing up Biden's history with race or not, they were not poorly executed in the slightest. They're literally the reason she's being touted as the "winner" of the debates, and the reason that she's surging in the polls while Biden is plummeting and looks terrible coming out of the debates.  I won't argue about them being planned, but planning something doesn't make it any less genuine of a concern, and it's pretty clear that she meant what she was saying even if she was using it as a strategy to score points-- especially because it highlighted a very real problem with Biden rather than just race baiting.
he has no traction with Blacks and is absolutely terrible with Latinos: https://www.univision.com/univision-news/politics/harris-and-castro-rise-among-hispanics-after-the-first-democratic-debate.  You cannot win the democratic primary without a decent amount of African American and latino voters. Pete is unfortunately an entirely media manufactured politician (he has some really good ideas though). Warren has some problems with minorities too but she is increasing her support among them
Was it from big donations?
No one is going to win Indiana lol.   Castro is probably a better VP pick than Beto.
10% gets you exactly the same as 0%. Until he's polling at a minimum of 15% he's a non-factor.
Only way I see it happening is if he does something major like remove the entire board that is charged with hiring and firing the police force.    Platitudes will not work with black folks, he needs Actions, not words at this point. But actions goes against his crafted image as a nice guy with nice words.
I think you can win the primary with limited support, as long as the field remains highly divided. As long as few people drop out. And with the early primaries, especially CA, I think the field will stay divided.
Lol I don‚Äôt think you understand what non-factor means. By your standards, Hillary was a ‚Äúnon-factor‚Äù in the presidential election
I agree, I've seen similar issues with my current city and enough is not being done here as well
> something major like remove the entire board that is charged with hiring and firing the police force.   Look racial discrimination and police shootings make my blood boil as much as anyone, but is that really a reasonable thing to expect from every mayor in every city every time a police shooting happens?
The only way I see it is if he does all of that and then the Top Four candidates and Cory Booker die or are abducted by aliens.
Winning a primary with limited support almost guarantees a poor showing in the general election.
Diversifing the police force should be his highest priority to ease tension in the city. If the board can't do that he should appoint a board that will.   There is no easy solution and my idea is one one of many possible solutions but words are not enough anymore, and all Mr Pete seems to offer is words.
Words are how he ever appeared to be anything more than a small time mayor from a tiny population.
Warren saved our home from an illegal foreclosure when our bank lied and tried to steal our home during the housing crisis. We were able to file a complaint with proof. She created the CFPB to protect citizens.
Honestly, Warren does not get enough credit for creating the CPFB.  It's one of the single most important progressive accomplishments in recent history.  And a real world example of how she will govern as president.
Thank you for posting!
And now Trump and Mulvaney have twisted it around to act as the Corporate Financial Protection Bureau.
The CFPB played a huge role in saving my home, too.
I'm in a CPFB whistleblower suit right now:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LyEneekRpZrX5A1feuyJRgBxjXICdOIP
People have tried to tell me time and time again Obama and Biden were responsible for this and I always have to point out it was Warren who came up with the whole thing in the first place.
I'm still so disappointed in my state that we didn't elect her CFPB protege, Rich Cordray, as governor in 2018. Like, even if you hate "BiG gOvErNmEnT," if you read about the CFPB for like 5 minutes, how could you not think that it's such an enormously beneficial agency for everyday people? Ah, answered my own question...
I‚Äôm a Bernie fan, but her work on the CFPB is unmatched. She‚Äôs a bonafide superstar.
That pisses me off to no end.
Obligatory:  *President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."*  It's sad that this sentiment is still true.
Warren Statistically Tied with Biden in New Poll
I vastly prefer Warren over Harris. I hope this sticks
Bernie guy here: I‚Äôm predicting Bernie will lose support as the race continues. Not because people don‚Äôt like him or his policies, but because they‚Äôll see Warren as a more electable Alternative. She‚Äôs better in debates, has clearer plans, and she‚Äôs younger and seems more spry. Bernie will hang in till the end to keep pushing the party to the left but he‚Äôll throw his support behind Warren when the time comes to give her the edge over Biden/ Harris.
Don't get happy, people! Time and or money are still needed.
Why is this poll so different than all the others?
Who are all of these people pulling for Biden? This feels like Hillary 2.0 where the people want one candidate but another is somehow constantly ahead in everything.   Maybe it's just different out here in Washington state? I'm just not seeing or hearing any actual interest in Biden. Anecdotally, the consensus amongst my circles is that he is the easiest way Democrats lose this election.
I believe that we will win!
There's a paywall. Anyone know what poll they are referencing?
It's starting to look like its gonna be Warren vs Harris.
This was a predebate poll. I wonder how much it‚Äôs shifted since then.
I love Warren. But is she too old like Bernie and like Joe. I mean Joe has many many many problems outside being old. But is it time to pass the torch, like that guy said, and invest in next generation. I'm probably still going to vote Liz in the meantime
I was in a similar boat before the debates, namely because I think Warren has better crossover appeal through the bible and rust belt. Harris can be a little... Grating and... *Californian*, and I say this as a former rural Appalachian hillbilly.  However I finally saw what other people see in her after that debate and her ferocious and justified take-down of Biden. I want a fighter, and that fighting spirit is important to me. (Edit: I guess I just said the same thing twice...)  That being said, I still lean Warren. Harris surpassed a few others though.
I definitely prefer Liz but Harris is my #2, and after that there‚Äôs a steep drop-off.
I like Harris as a possible Attorney General or even Secretary of State, I don't think she would make a good president though.
Well, Warren is a progressive and Kamala Harris isn't, so everyone should prefer her.
Incoming Harris supporters to correct your opinion, in/r/Elizabethwarren of all places
A few more quality debates, and I might go with Harris. I think Harris is a better head-to-head matchup with Trump. I want to live in Warren‚Äôs America, but more than that I *don‚Äôt* want Trump to be president anymore. So, I am conflicted. I would like to see some more focused debates after the candidates get trimmed down to 6 or so.
Hope so...I was really wanting Bernie and Warren to be the top two spots, but I'm afraid Bernie will drop down in the polls more. If one of those two can win, I will be happy. I so hope that either one will be willing to back the other when the time comes for that.
If that happens, throw your social support into Warren. Get your friends voting. I'm a Vermoter and love Bernie. But let's win after the primaries
Completely agree, I think she's the best for unifying the party since she can appeal to the further left and moderates.
Please tell your remaining Bernie friends And the campaign to cut the conspiracy crap and refresh the message. We need you guys to stick around for as long as possible but the way you are tracking now, it will not happen.   The anger just isn‚Äôt playing as well this time. Bernie‚Äôs campaign just made fun of Buttigieg because he outraised Sanders this quarter. Faiz Shakir complained that he served ‚ÄúParmesan encrusted salmon on a toothpick.‚Äù People have a pretty positive opinion of Buttigieg. He‚Äôs well spoken, well liked; and playing by the rules you advocated for. Doing that was an unforced error. Pete Buttigieg has taken zero dollars from super pacs and was propelled by grassroots LGBTQ donors.   Bernie needs to start running a reputable campaign that mainstream progressives and working professionals on the left can also get behind. It‚Äôs telling that last week instead of preparing for the debate in a way to reach out to new voters he was on S4P having an AMA.
I'm pretty positive that if Warren is nominated she'll chose bernie as a VP if that helps
Sometimes polls are outliers, nothing necessarily wrong with the poll unless it happens for that pollster consistently. Warren support here is unusually high, but it shows that same 6-10 point drop for Biden towards Harris that every other poll shows.
[deleted]
Consensus is the same in Iowa. I know people who like Biden. They're Blue dog types. Really, union Republicans basically. Around here, I hear more about Warren, Harris, Booker, and Pete than Bernie or Biden.
Biden does well with minorities and people over 50, neither of which are "online" that much but are the largest parts of the voter base. Old people are also the ones that consistently turn out and vote too, if he didn't constantly put his foot in his mouth he would have been a great candidate from an election standpoint
Just has the most name recognition for people who aren't heavily "into" politics, and is "safer" as a moderate than Warren or Sanders.  Also was VP under Obama.  He's the most "vanilla" candidate, so ends up being a lot of people's pick if they have no strong initial leaning--this should probably change as the election season gets underway, and we have more debates and exposure for the other candidates.  Still, he'll have a strong showing, because he's so moderate, and a lot of people just want a return to "normalcy" after Trump.  He's also very corporate-friendly, so he's not going to to ruffle the feathers of the "old money" donors in the DNC or corporate media.  Same reason pop music keeps surviving--it's safe, easy to listen to, doesn't ask much thought from the listener.
>This feels like Hillary 2.0 where the people want one candidate but another is somehow constantly ahead in everything.   Because more people wanted Clinton, and right now more people want Biden. Doesn't mean they can't be persuaded, but denying their very existence (and thus failing to address their concerns) is not the way to go about it.
I haven't heard about him much in VA either.  I know people were excited when Warren came around!
He may be Hillary 2.0, but the context around the election is so much different this time around that the comparison doesn‚Äôt really matter. Trump was never considered that serious of a threat running up to the 2016 election. Clinton didn‚Äôt motivate people to go vote, sure, and that might be the same for Biden. But this time around I think voting Trump out of office is the biggest motivator for people to go, regardless of who the democratic candidate is. I think every democratic candidate smells blood in the water, which is why the pool has been so comically large this time around.
He's well know and the safe establishment candidate. It's already happening but I think he'll continue to drop in the polls as the primary season goes on and other candidates get more recognition.
More like 2007 Hillary 2.0.
>This feels like Hillary 2.0 where the people want one candidate but another is somehow constantly ahead in everything.  Twitter isn't real life; Hillary won the primary by 4 million votes. Please don't be dismissive of our votes by calling us not "the people."

https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2019/6/28/here-are-the-final-pre-debate-numbers
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/  One of the latest YouGov polls from June 27- July 2nd is what they are referring to here -- the one with Biden 23, Warren 22
No, the article is about a poll done after the debates. Biden is at 23%, Warren is at 22%, Harris is at 17%, and Sanders is at 15%.
You need to read *the entire article* before commenting...      The first part of the article talks about the pre-debate numbers.      > *The pollsters went into the field before the debate, finding mostly what other pollsters have found, though their sample had an unusually strong level of support for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). After 1,522 completed voter interviews, focused on registered Democrats who were likely to vote in the primary, pollsters found Joe Biden in the lead, but narrowly.*      The second part of the article talks about the post-debate numbers.    > *Then came debate night. Over the next few days, opinion sifted, leaving the same candidates in the front but showing Harris surging and Biden falling into a statistical tie with Warren.  ...  Behind that movement was a changing voter assessment of who could win the election. Biden moved from 71 to 73 percent on that question; Sanders was basically flat, going from 56 to 55 percent. But Harris surged, with 56 percent of voters saying she could beat Trump, up 15 points. Warren jumped from 51 to 57 percent on the electability question; Buttigieg moved up the same amount, though at 31 to 37 percent he was still far from the front.  ...  ‚ÄúWarren and Biden are now statistically indistinguishable in the horserace (only one point apart), and the aura of inevitability around Biden has disappeared (less than half of Democratic primary voters now believe he is most likely to win)," Data for Progress's Sean McElwee wrote in an email. ‚ÄúThere is no front-runner, only front-runners.‚Äù*     >    > *The Data for Progress-YouGov Blue survey was conducted online among a sample of registered voters who said they might participate in their state‚Äôs Democratic primary or caucus, including 1,522 respondents before last week‚Äôs debates and 1,522 respondents after both debates. ...*
Uhhh quite the political shift you've had since posting this 6 months ago   >"Why isn't Sharpiro running for office? Stop selling books and grab a Senator seat or something. I feel like Ben can bring a solid, conservative, modern opinion to politics but I hate seeing him wasting time running around to college campuses collecting lawsuits."   üëÄ
Post history all in sports. Russian bot alert
I beg you to just just vote for who you like best in the primary and not be strategic like this. Worry about what you want, not what everyone else wants. This gamespersonship will be the death of our democracy.
I really don‚Äôt get the sentiment that Harris is more of a fighter than Warren. Harris‚Äôs was more about appealing to emotion that showed Biden‚Äôs wrongdoing.   THIS is take-down:  https://youtu.be/AyVr4qcn8EM
She‚Äôs no doubt a great debater, but I thought it was pretty obvious she came to the debate with that take down of Biden locked and loaded
That's interesting. While I thought Harris' confrontation with Biden was necessary to expose his weaknesses many voters were ignoring or ignorant of, it didn't actually have much substance. How does calling out Biden for a 50 year old policy 'put food on the table?' A $500 tax credit and reminding people that putting children in cages is bad seems like a pretty weak platform to me. Not to mention her record as a prosecuter screams 'opportunist' whereas Warren has been fighting for this causes in and out of political office for decades.  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html
I went to a Harris rally when she was in Houston. I thought she was fine. Not bad by any means, but safe. I think if "the party" were to choose a nominee it'd be Harris. I don't mean that in a tin foil hat way, more in the "who can we choose who'd piss off the least numbers of people?"  She's liberal *enough*  She's charismatic *enough*  There's more charismatic and more liberal people, but she's got *enough* of each that she'd be a fine nominee
Hillary beat Trump at the debates in a Harris like fashion but she didn't excite the base enough because of a lack of progressive policies. I fear Harris would be similar.
I don't really like her positions as much, but Harris just looks like a President.    She might make Trump cry.
I've donated to two candidates. Liz and Pete. Harris is my #3 but she's a steep drop off vs those two
I feel like Sanders is my number two and I'm confused when people say Harris is their number two. Warren and Sanders have nearly identical policy compared to the differences between them and Harris/Biden. I don't think Harris would be a horrible president but I doubt she would be able to save our country in many of the ways Warren and Sanders could. In the interest of educating myself about Harris, why do you prefer Harris to Sanders?
Not only is Harris no progressive, she has a genuinely horrible record as a prosecutor and AG. Here's an article on Democracy Now about her: [https://www.democracynow.org/2019/7/2/kamala\_harris\_not\_a\_progressive\_prosecutor](https://www.democracynow.org/2019/7/2/kamala_harris_not_a_progressive_prosecutor)
Eh, vote for who you believe in in the primary and then vote blue in the race. If Harris wins I'll definitely vote for her but I think Warren may be able to actually save our country.
Its kind of crazy how fast Bernies star has fallen (no offense). I honestly thought he would at least hang on until the final three, but he's already hemoraging support to Harris and Warren.
They both pledged that they would and have both proven true to their word.
Oh for sure. I‚Äôve got no animosity to either of them, nor any of the Dem candidates with a few exceptions. We need to oust the cheese puff. I wish I could do more to help as a Canadian. Maybe I‚Äôll change my citizenship to Russian so I can interfere in your election with complete impunity.
I think she would pick someone from the traditional left to balance the ticket and unify the party as much as possible.
I am 100% positive she will not do that.
Wow, why so many downvotes
Joe Biden is no Hillary Clinton. She was a great debater, smart and prepared, and she apologized for any mistakes she made. Biden literally refuses too apologize or address past behaviour. Thats why Hillary polled at around 60% in the primary last time around and Biden is hovering around 25% now. I think it will go only downhill for him, because the way he has acted makes it seem like he‚Äôs really set in his ways and does not care to empathize. If him being more likeable than Hillary Clinton means maybe more white men would vote for him in the general election, than that maybe so, but I think that has more to do with his gender than with him. Hillary might have been less ‚Äúlikeable‚Äù but she was smarter than him and more progressive.
The feel I get is that Bernie has way more name recognition than Biden, who was largely forgettable as a VP. But this is likely just being way out here on the west coast speaking. My wife still forgets who Obama's VP was.
[deleted]
Did more want Hillary though? In my state, there seemed to be no interest in Hillary at all. No bumper stickers. No signs. No Facebook propaganda. No tv ads. Nothing. It was all Trump and Bernie.   It was really odd to us that she was the nominee and many were talking about conspiracy. And we're a strong blue state. Many of the people close to me didn't vote for her despite being staunch Democrats.   That's what seemed so odd to us. That she was even the nominee. We're not an old money state though, so there's that.
Thank you for trying, but it looks like he is just linking back to another WaPo story
Thank you!
Lol oops. Redditing at work is not conducive to being a thorough redditor.
Are they the same 1,522 respondents?
Lol yeah I was trolling and failing. Not a good look for me.
Lol I'm not a bot but ok. Just a guy who likes sports and progressiveism. And as someone else pointed out failing to troll in a conservative sub once.
Everyone thinks he's a professional pundit. Pundits and predictors have been wrong again and again. It is unwise to 'settle' for someone due to what is likely to be poor punditry, both in terms of having to settle and then to settle based upon bad analysis.   This is not to say there is no room for strategy, but use it as rarely as possible and with great care.
Speaking as someone who was a former Beto supporter because I thought others would like him...You really have NO CLUE who people are going to end up liking. So just go with who you truly like.
It also amplifies the effect of negative traits like sexism and racism.  If *I'm* not sexist or racist, but I make choices because I'm worried what sexists and racists would think, their preferences will be represented way out of proportion to their actual numbers.    We already have a method to incorporate the biases of voters, it's the primary itself, no need to add another layer on top of it.
Exactly this.
I've voted for a good while now and consider myself to be pretty informed on the issues. This is certainly a passion of mine, and it's my judgement that I must be *somewhat* strategic about my voting. Politics is pragmatism is compromise oftentimes, and I must try my best to empathize with the type of person who is less likely to vote nevertheless is a *potential* voter.   I will say this: I keep strategy to the primaries, and whoever the Dems nominate out of the batch of candidates will be leagues above Trump. Joe is probably my least favorite of the top tier likely candidates, but I will still vote lest I give power to Trump.
Oh yes, I do love that video, and I'm not really comparing Harris against Warren. Put it this way: I believe Warren, while maybe not as pointed sometimes as the Prosecutor, can make you feel little in your chair like the teacher/professor she is.  And moreover, I believe Warren‚Äîlike Sanders‚Äîhas proven the depth of her commitment over the years. That's a big advantage in my eyes.
These people are experts at scamming people and getting away with it. He probably has too much plausible deniability for people to consider him to be taken down.
I was surprised that there wasn't more backlash against "not a racist but." That part seemed dirty to me. The rest was excellent though, and it was an emotion-substance combo.
Well that is the point of the debate. She should be prepared with the points she wants to make. It should be obvious and it was. That is a good thing. Warren was prepared too, which is great. I really like engaging and informative debates.
>How does calling out Biden for a 50 year old policy   She asked if he regretted it with today's hindsight and he said no + instead made a state's rights argument. I think that's 100% relevant for voter's to understand
I think that's a pretty good assessment.
Right? I'm kind of disappointed that he seems to be dropping, everyone was saying he has to expand on his base from 2016. I know there's time left still, but I hope he can do something about it.
WaPo/ABC & Reuters IPSOS out today both have him at 2nd place gaining after the debates. His star hasn't faded, the media just want to make sure he doesn't take Biden's place at the top.
I hope she doesn't do that. The "traditional left" is the same centrist bullshit that has plagued Democrats for decades, caused us to lose multiple elections, and handed political power to corporations and the wealthy elite. They are the reason for Donald Trump. They have to go.
It was a bad idea that no one agrees with lol
I think a big factor in the difference in percentages is the difference in the number of candidates. Hillary wasn't running against 20 people...there were only four others in that race, and only two of them were ever real contenders.
Bernie was virtually unknown prior to 2016. Biden had run for President and served as VP for 8 years.
Young white people are statistically over represented on social platforms like reddit is what I'm saying, not that there literally aren't any old people or minorities
"Did more want Hillary though?"  about 3.7 million more (predominantly in states without caucuses), yes
Honestly, the Trump and Bernie people were absolutely brutal to Hillary people during the primaries. I'm not surprised that Hillary supporters didn't feel comfortable voicing their opinion when they would be constantly attacked for it. If your preferred candidate is winning, and showing support for that candidate just brings out angry people, why would you even bother saying anything?
That‚Äôs extremely anecdotal and likely a function of the people you associate with
Exactly, and then vote smart in the general.
I think it's relevant and said so in my comment. My point was that it didn't lead into any pragmatic policy discussion like she had said they needed to focus on earlier in the night with her 'food fight' comment. It was purely an attack that benefitted her campaign.
That's pretty paranoid haha.
Are Obama and Bill Clinton not the traditional left?
I agree, but those traditional voters aren‚Äôt gone yet. So, we‚Äôre stuck in this transitional moment. If it helps us win, I‚Äôm okay with it. VP doesn‚Äôt really have much power beyond what you give them anyway.
You sound salty. I was just offering a suggestion. No need to be nasty but I guess that was asking too much on reddit.
Maybe that's it. It was just an odd election cycle. In all other elections, Gore and Kerry and Obama had massive representation along with their Republican counterparts. Then comes this election and Hillary was literally nowhere to be found. It just felt off.
That would be why I said "anecdotally" in my original post. This is also why I am posing these questions; to gauge if other people outside of my anecdotal circles have experienced the same thing.
It was about her experience too. No one thought she was going to say that she was the little girl who was bussed. It is personal to her, and it is telling of Biden‚Äôs character that he can not apologize and still stands by states rights. Harris made a great point. Warren won the first night and Harris won the second night. An issue that might not be important to you personally might very well be important and relevant to other communities.   She can focus on a multitude of issues. She does not have to stick to one talking point on how to put food on the table. Warren addresses multiple issues too, which is good. They are smart candidates and discussions impacting different communities is important.
How is that paranoia? It's an A+ poll showing him in second place.  The real "star is fading," here is Biden. It's only a matter of time before he drops into single digits.
It'd be consistent with their interests. They want Harris or Biden. They are particularly terrified of the word socialism and Warren/Sanders support for ending private primary health insurance (A $1.6Trillion industry). Literally trillions are at stake, and these same people own CNN/MSNBC.
Obama less so, but yes. Get out of new road if you can lend your hand, for the times they are a-changing.
They have influence. I disagree that moving toward the center will help us win. We simply need to use the right language. A majority of Americans are fully on board with the so called "leftist" policies Bernie has been espousing.
Biden's middle-of-the-road malarkey is not the answer in 2020. No presidential candidate in my lifetime has better matched America's needs than Warren.
i've written it before, but it'd be surreal to suddenly have the best-qualified, most insightful president in US history.
Warren is the only candidate who truly grasps the political moment that we're in and how to use power to make the changes this country needs.

Liz has already sealed my vote 100%
Biden is the scariest thing the DNC can do.
Biden's bid sounds like he lost a bet to Obama, something like "If Trump wins, you have to run in 2020".  It's disheartening and further muddies the political water.
Sanders is good too.
I‚Äôm pretty heavily on the Pete boat but Warren has captured my attention and is absolutely my #2 pick and if Pete wins the nom the person I‚Äôd want as VP. I had her at the bottom of my list and she‚Äôs risen very quickly
Joe Biden is a spineless coward who sees his spineless cowardice as a virtue, which is the worst part about it all.
I'm definitely voting for Biden, given the chance. To me, he seems like the only candidate on either side that's even close to being aligned with my views on policy in general. Granted, I'm never voting for Trump, but so many of the Democratic candidates have gone so bonkers far-left, I'm not sure what other choice I'd have besides Biden.
Love her.  Love Pete.  Bernie has some good ideas.  Biden is a dinosaur and his ideas are weak/non-existent.  He is not what the US needs to move forward and improve.
Yep. When she says it's a fight, she means we have to use every power we have - not say "hey let's sit down for some bipartisanship." The Republicans want a minority-majority government and they want that to be permanent. It's working. Anyone who doesn't get that or who wants to reminisce about good old Orrin Hatch, needs to get out of the way.
and mainstream media is complying with giving him the most coverage
Which means they'll fight to the death to shoehorn him in. Honestly the worst or second worst of our options.
Warren needs to go directly after Biden during the debates. Bernie simply cannot get away with that, it would just make him look bad and generate sympathy for Biden given certain historical context.   Warren on the other hand would only come off as stronger. Proving that she has the ability to take on Trump.
The DNC doesn't pick the candidate.
The crazy thing is Obama seems to be a Beto supporter. Obama met with Beto shortly before Beto‚Äôs announce and now Beto‚Äôs hiring all of Obama‚Äôs old campaign staffers.  I thought for sure Biden, the 76 year old, two time presidential loser wouldn‚Äôt run.
I'm leaning Warren then Bernie right now. Either way if a progressive candidate has a big lead over other progressive candidates by the primaries I believe that we should all fall in line behind that candidate. Otherwise progressives will all split their vote and Biden will be guaranteed to win the primary. Biden is a huge improvement over the democracy threat that is Donald, but given all of the potential in the Democratic primaries it would be a shame if we couldn't get one of them to the general election.
Why do you like Pete?
Yeah, my top two are Warren and Pete, too.  The only two I'd be sad to see win the nomination, though, would be Biden and Gabbard. Everyone else I'd be happy to vote for.  I'd vote for Biden/Gabbard over Trump, but I'd sigh as I did it.
He is worse than that. He takes bank money
Just curious. Which policies of Warren are too far left for you?
Just remember, a lot of real people are afraid. You have to convince them that Biden also isn't the safe option.
I would do anything for a Warren/Buttigieg ticket.
They are going full into it too.
Na, they All need to attack Biden out. He is dangerously bad for our government right now.  Edit: but I agree warren needs to be savage when we get to the debates. I want people scared to reference her topics. I want them keeping her in the corner of their eyes like she has a fucking dragon waiting to pounce on stupidity. Which will most likely be Biden.
Yes they do. They chose Truman over Wallace in the 40s and Clinton over Bernie recently. (I will not debate any on this topic if ignorant of west Virginia 2016)  Party over country both times.   They have no legal obligation to not cheat. The DNC has NO legal requirement to let us choose anything. This was established in court.   If we want Warren to win we need to assert that we won't fucking take this bullshit.
I can't imagine that Obama is crazy about Biden running around telling everyone that Republicans are going to have some epiphany and be willing to work with democrats once Trump is out. Seems kind of fucked up considering 2008-2016
I know people think Biden and Obama must be super close friends but honestly I am not so sure that would be the case
I'm subbed to this sub, Pete's and Bernie's on Reddit. If the primary were held today I'd vote for Warren but would be happy with any of those three (and frankly, happy with most of the rest of the Democrat candidates).  For policy, I like Warren the best followed by Bernie. I don't know in regards to Pete since he hasn't set most of them out yet.  For electability I'm focused on who will most likely turn out Democrat voters, not on how well they'll get Trump supporters to vote for them. I think Bernie might have an edge on Warren if the election were today but perhaps publicity from the debates will change that. Even though Biden isn't high on my list, older white Democrats *really* like him and older black people do too (due to his affiliation with Obama among other reasons). Younger people probably won't turn out as much for him as they would for Pete, Warren or Bernie but that might be outweighed by more older Democrats turning out.  I think climate change is the most important issue facing us and electing Biden won't help that enough to prevent disaster which is the main reason he's pretty far down my list. Although no matter who's elected, if we don't give them a Democrat-controlled Senate they won't be able to do much as you can count on 100% obstruction from the Republicans. Biden may think there's Republicans he can deal with as he has good personal relations with some of them but he's dead wrong. The Senate has changed a lot since he was last in there representing Delaware. Even if there were any Republican senators who wanted to vote for a Democrat-led bill, they'd very likely get primaried in their next election if they voted for it. They care about self-preservation before anything else no matter what.
This for sure, but we also have to vote Biden in general if he gets there
I'm a total Bernie guy but I really like Warren personally.  I hope that as the primaries continue the two senators unify and work together to take down Biden.  If they're together, it's totally possible.  Ofc I'd prefer Bernie at the top of the ticket but I'd be so happy if Liz is our 46th president.
Pete might not have the most concrete policies out there, but he has a very calming, measured, and reassuring demeanor about him. Much in the same way that Obama did.  He‚Äôs also undeniably intelligent, and like it or not, he does have military experience, which kind of IMO should be at least a light prerequisite for the person who is ultimately in charge of our armed forces (having an infant like Trump in office has really hammered that home to me).  Being a president is more than just having great policies. They are also the face of the country, and they need to be able to broker agreements between the parties in our government as well as with other countries. I think Pete would be great in that regard, maybe the best out of any of the candidates.  Personally, I think Pete and Warren are the perfect complements to each other. Warren is by far the candidate with the clearest idea on what the country needs and how to realistically achieve it.  Pete by far has the most charisma of any of the candidates out there. I personally feel like we should all want some combination of those two in the executive branch.
Policies aside, because I agree with most and his priorities outside of Chelsea Manning, I think he‚Äôs what we need in this time. He talks about generational change and winning the era and I think having a youthful, charismatic voice could really shape the era that he‚Äôs talking about. That‚Äôs a short summary
Mine too
Biden is the only Democratic candidate who is guaranteed to lose to Trump.
She would need a running mate who would balance her on foreign policy. Or preferably she could beef up her own statements on foreign policy. That‚Äôs my primary hesitation, and it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôd come up with great measured positions I just want to see what they are now.
That was what happened with Donald Trump. But it was also what happened with Howard Dean. It is hard to say which way a gang-up would end.
The DNC did not choose Hillary. Primary voters did. Overwhelmingly. Sorry. Let's not re-litigate 2016, particularly if we're going to make stuff up.
I wish he would just enjoy retirement after a great career. Please Biden, just let it go
Goddamn He sucks. Here‚Äôs to the threequel Joe!üç∫
In retrospect it seems like Biden was Obama‚Äôs pawn. Obama‚Äôs candidacy was hugely controversial because he‚Äôs black and has a Muslim name. He chose the most conservative, white male democratic candidate to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù the ticket.
My biggest concern is changing the system, which is why I like Warren. Get money out of politics, make the voting system responsive to the people, and give workers more power. Then we will be able to do our best with everything else. I don't think that's very controversial either, so I think it can be pursued regardless of other priorities.
100%
I'm a little pessimistic on this unfortunately. I think they will both stay in the race, and I think if that happens they will cannibalize eachother. This is one of the huge problems with first past the post voting, which is why voting reform should be one of the top priorities of people.
The best president of my lifetime had zero military experience, so that doesn‚Äôt factor in with me at all. I also do not understand where this ‚ÄúPete is so charismatic‚Äù take comes from. He is utterly milquetoast, bland beyond compare. He is in the running for *least* charismatic, he just gets some weird, unearned boost for being remarkably young. I get that Warren is old and a bit reserved, but she has a specific vision for the party and for America, and that is more inspiring than the ‚Äúhip‚Äù millennial.
[I‚Äôm not sure I would call him ‚Äúcharismatic.‚Äù](https://youtu.be/XJ3DmxZFX6w) He‚Äôs very inexperienced. He hasn‚Äôt even held state office. South Bend is only the 4th largest city in Indiana. He seems like he talks a big game, but Warren‚Äôs policies blow him out of the water, and all of them are based on generational change. Nothing about him would ‚Äúempower millennials‚Äù more than Warren‚Äôs policies.  And the biggest problem is I just can‚Äôt see him beating Trump, so he is not a candidate I can get behind.
Well I wouldn't say guaranteed but its a fucking coin toss
I said it about Hillary at the caucuses in 2016 and I'll say it again now about Biden: You want Trump? This is how you get Trump.
Like I said, you have to convince the people who don't already agree with you.
Only candidate?  I can't see Inslee, Hickenlooper, de Blasio, Swalwell, Castro, or Delaney getting very far.
Obviously it'll hinge on him releasing proper policy, but he was a Naval Intelligence Officer for seven years. That's a pretty damn firm foundation for understanding the rest of the world.
With trump it worked for him because republicans were old wind bags full of shit and everyone knew it. He went up there and said you guys are crooks and everyone ate it up.   That won't work the same way here. When the progressives throw the gauntlet down Biden will have NOTHING to return the challenge with but a bunch of vapid platitudes that do NOT work well with any voter who pays attention.
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river...
For real though. If you think you are right go check out 2016 dnc primaries on wiki and tell me how many counties Clinton won. Then tell me who won the state. Do that and we can discuss your opinions.
Also, when changing the system, who can control the levers effectively. Imagine a divided government with the current Republican party. It's not just fighting with Republicans or bad faith compromise. Someone willing to fight with reactionary Republicans will have to go beyond denouncing actions and actually use the power of the presidency.   Who has set out a plan to maneuver within the system if faced with Republican stonewalling? Warren. Who has literally created a federal agency? Warren. Who does the best consistent oversight as a senator? Warren.   Bernie and Pete simply don't have a plan or a clue, respectively, on how to use the executive branch by itself to better the lives of Americans.
If either of them are worth their salt they'll work together to beat Biden.  The future of the progressive movement depends on it.  Whoever between Bernie and Warren is leading after New Hampshire and Nevada should be who the entire progressive movement should be working for.
Just cause I am curious, who was the best in your lifetime?
How can you see Warren beating trump? And actually I would say Pete has the experience needed for the office as he has managed a whole city and had to deal with the ins and outs of actually managing people, and Warren would be a perfect VP as head of the senate
Even if he is able to win, he'll win by directly appealing to centrist independents and moderate republicans, which means most of the bad things we are seeing happening under Trump will continue unabated.
Agreed. It would also mean he‚Äôd had to debate Pence, which I‚Äôd love to see.
GP. I'll add a bit more...  When the candidates went after Howard Dean, the media was part of the attack. In a Joe Biden situation, the media would mostly take his side.
I don't understand how so many people can look at the vote tallies and think that there's somehow some conspiracy afoot. Bernie isn't even a Democrat, and he rubs a lot of people the wrong way. Oh wait, I DO understand why so many people think this way - it was one of the main Russian operations in 2016 to convince a bunch of people not to vote for Hillary. You've fallen for some propaganda, friend. Don't worry, it's not too late to get reacquainted with reality.
Obama, without hesitation.
Yes, Warren can absolutely beat Trump because her policies are rock solid and with practical appeal for a majority of Americans, even those in Trump‚Äôs base. South Bend is not a particularly impressive city. It‚Äôs a college town. It isn‚Äôt even the state capitol. *Of Indiana.* He‚Äôs a wannabe Obama with none of Obama‚Äôs strengths. Hard pass.
VP is the worst position, Warren should stay in the senate if she's not the nominee
I agree they will. They already have. That's why we must be savagely loud. I'm letting every mother fucker know when they are wrong, how and why. I'm so pissed... But yeah. The media hasn't been on my side for a while so that's not new. What is new is now I walk  with an army of progressive people! 6 years ago I felt alone. Now I know, it's inevitable.
Oooo, so you are taking an extra scoop of 'party over country' then? Tell me more about that.
[removed]
Y'all are gonna hate me but the last president who could even be considered decent was Lyndon Johnson. In fact, he was one of the absolute best -- and that's even with the horrific Vietnam War.  And since I'm loving the hate, I have another crazy idea. In 2008, I preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama.
You didn‚Äôt come to debate, you came to say you‚Äôre right.
No, I'm taking a "there wasn't a secret conspiracy against Bernie Sanders in 2016, there was a predictably large group of Democrats who didn't cotton to him, he dragged out the primary and benefited from Russian interference, and it would be helpful if we didn't replicate that model in 2020, which would include parroting the Russian propaganda about the DNC we see here."
Ooh, true progressive! True progressive! Come at me, Bro! Get the fuck out of here with this fucking purity troll nonsense. Do whatever the fuck you want in 2020 but if you don't wholeheartedly support the Democrat, drop the act and just admit that you're happy to watch the rest of the country burn.
Okay.
Close: I came to say *you‚Äôre wrong*
You are missing the forest in all these trees there...  Go ahead wallow in your ignorance about what I have verified.  But don't attack my comment because you don't like it. Your the one who is unwilling to look at the proof nor acknowledge that I'm right.   You have no argument that works against mine. So muddy it up more but at the end of the day. What I said is accurate, and what you said isn't.
You came at me first. Literally. Attacked my stance. Then after I proved you wrong, you views about it and started to talk about everything else you can. Good job.
With no substance to your argument
You didn't prove anything other than you seem to not have learned anything from 2016. Goodbye.
Ha okay
Biden endorses Liz's bankruptcy plan. A reminded that you don't have to get the nomination to affect change in this country.
Aside from it being good that he is endorsing one of Warren‚Äôs policies, it‚Äôs a good sign that if Warren is able to achieve legislative accomplishments in the Senate (which I have no doubt she will if Dems win a majority), then Biden is going to sign those bills into law.
I have such mixed feelings; Glad Team Joe's smart enough to know Wonder Warren had a plan for that, and wants to rub that magic all in his campaign pomade- but TBH don't ask me to pretend "You're *good*, Professor..." never happened, either.  Joe, America's basically picked you for nom, so I'm not going to help Twitler and hostile foreign powers divide and conquer- but put your money where your mouth is *after* the hash settles, then ask me how I feel.
a reminder that women does all the work and the men takes the prize (no puns).
The fact is, when you elect a president you elect the entire executive branch. Dozens of appointments from judges to cabinet heads. Some of those will surely be "Warrenites", if you will. We're on the same team.
I‚Äôm probably not the only one cynical enough to think that a Biden endorsement is not the same as an honest commitment to implement the plan if elected. No doubt he‚Äôll cave under pressure from the banking industry.

a halfhearted endorsement for a bill that will certainly not come up for a vote is not change
That's what I want to see. Not just lip service but a position of real power for her (and other women, and POC) in his administration.
> don't ask me to pretend "You're good , Professor..." never happened, either.  I interpreted that moment (at some kind of hearing or panel on bankruptcy reform) as a compliment. Was there some underlying message I missed?
Thank you.   Biden like Trump will be a useless figurehead in an oval office.   The job I care about electing is Steven Miller and Jared Kushner, and all the other faceless policy writers and influencers - who are drawing up policy and slapping it on the president's desk for them to sign.   Bidens personal opinions don't matter if hes just getting a brief on what hes signing, what matters is the details. If Warren were potus she'd be reading the entire thing herself, proposing changes, and signing only when she owns it.   I doubt Biden will do any of that - but that's fine. Give me a Warrenite in the policy slots and that's nearly as good as Warren herself as potus.  Edit: it's not the same, but it will do.
his history shows exactly that. We cannot celebrate this unless he takes responsibility for the impacts his policy caused.
Amen.
In this title I believe either effect or affect works. And since the article is written as Biden-centric, I‚Äôm thinking affect more closely matches their intent. Someone can correct me, but my understanding is:   - If you see Liz as the one responsible for the change, it‚Äôs effect.   - If you see it as Biden (being the presumptive nominee) ultimately causing the change if elected, with Liz having an effect on his policy, it‚Äôs affect.
Removed for Rule 4.
Removed for dividing Democrats.
also - you used ‚Äòaffect‚Äô incorrectly
It was a patronizing compliment offered in the context of being able to ignore her points.  An apology to Anita Hill might be nice too.  Like I said, it's not going to change my vote in November, but  *‚ô´Buh-buh-buh bah-bah NOT LOVIN' IT. ‚ô´*
Affect is not correct.   https://www.grammarly.com/blog/affect-vs-effect/  >Effect as a verb means to bring about. It usually shows up with nouns like ‚Äúchange‚Äù or ‚Äúsolutions.‚Äù > >>The protesters wanted to effect change in the corrupt government. > >In other words, they wanted to bring about the effect of change‚Äîmaybe by getting the government to change its policies or even step down. > >If you use affect here, it would mean ‚Äúto have an effect on change‚Äù or ‚Äúto impact change.‚Äù
Read the word in the sentence in which it appears.  ‚ÄúEffect‚Äù is obviously the right verb.
It‚Äôs [easier to remember](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/8b/00/5c8b001ef62b148f47f8ff4ce3633720.jpg) ‚Äòaffect‚Äô is most commonly a verb and ‚Äòeffect‚Äô is the result. In this title, it would definitely be ‚Äòaffect‚Äô.
A affects B, B experiences the effects of A's actions.
Exactly my point. If you see Biden as the primary one causing the change and Warren impacting his policy, then affect is correct.
The protesters are being used as a subject. There‚Äôs intent. Effect = to cause. Warren isn‚Äôt being used as a subject. It‚Äôs passive. Affect = producing a change.
In general yes, but effect can be a verb as well.
https://writingexplained.org/affect-change-or-effect-change
I don‚Äôt believe in typo or grammar pouncing in the internet, but if you‚Äôre going to argue about this... no, they‚Äôre 100% right. You effect change.
A affects B to effect changes to B's affect. The effects of this were significant.  Both words can be used in both parts of speech.
That's a huge stretch. Look at it this way. Did Warren start out looking at what Biden was going to change and say "I want to affect Biden's change"? Or did she start out looking at the bankruptcy situation and say "I want to affect bankruptcy"?   Now if this were someone like, say, Trump...Trump generally doesn't care about the result as long as he can get his name on it and take credit. In that case...Trump would just want to have an affect on the change itself, so he can parade it around. But Warren's end goal is not the change itself, but the thing that the change affects.
This was my (very brief) thinking when I wrote it. Warren influencing Biden's changes, because ultimately she doesn't cause the change. Oh well. English is fun.
Huh? Warren wanted to effect change. Warren didn't have to get the nomination to effect that change. That's literally what this subject line is trying to say.
I said ‚Äúmost commonly‚Äù referring to both and ‚Äòeffect‚Äô doesn‚Äôt work in this sentence. Using your examples, Warren isn‚Äôt the subject of the sentence, she‚Äôs not intentionally do this action, so it wouldn‚Äôt be correct to use ‚Äòeffect‚Äô as a verb. It‚Äôd have to be rewritten.
This is pedantic, but I would argue that Joe Biden is already going to make changes ‚Äì therefore Warren is affecting those changes. Either word seems to work here.  Either way you can't edit titles so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
It‚Äôs definitely ‚Äúeffect‚Äù because it‚Äôs in the sense of ‚Äúputting into effect‚Äù.
Your (very brief) thinking was correct! She‚Äôs the catalyst for change, the influence, not the one enacting it.    Regardless of the ridiculousness of the English language, I think we can all agree any of Warren‚Äôs influence on Biden and his policies is a hella good thing.
[Seriously?](https://wordcounter.net/blog/2019/03/03/103294_affect-vs-effect.html) That‚Äôs the message but it isn‚Äôt the sentence structure. She isn‚Äôt even included in the sentence we‚Äôre discussing. She isn‚Äôt creating the change or causing it to exist. Her plans influenced his opinion, they altered his platform, her intelligence is changing his already established campaign. He is the subject here and she is affecting him. If she was the subject and the sentence was rewritten (as you did in your comment), effect could be used.    But. Not. As. Currently. Written.
Nope.  In the sentence that appears, ‚Äúeffect‚Äù is correct.
> She isn‚Äôt even included in the sentence we‚Äôre discussing.  No. She's included in the sentence immediately before it. It's too bad that in the English language, context doesn't carry from one sentence to the next.
Hahaha sure, [have a great day!](https://giphy.com/gifs/elizabeth-warren-hand-rub-eH9QPDOyPd0DQu0OED)
And in the sentence immediately before it, she‚Äôs not the subject. It‚Äôs too bad that you‚Äôre being [sarcastic instead of actually reading.](https://giphy.com/gifs/elizabethwarren-shrug-debate-smirk-RhMDb6rdjULYFL5ubP) Have a great day!
You are right. She's not the subject. It's too bad  that you're being sarcastic instead of actually reading what I wrote.   Did I say she was the subject? No, I said she was included in the sentence immediately before it, and then suggested she was the context for the follow sentence.  Bill ran a marathon. It was the first one ever held in the town of Nowhereville.  What is the subject of the first sentence? Bill. What is the subject of the second sentence? "It". What is "It"? Thanks to context, we know it's the marathon. The marathon wasn't the subject of the first sentence, but was the context to identify the subject of the second sentence.  Biden endor'se Liz's bankruptcy plan. A Reminder that you don't have to get the nomination to affect change in this country.  What is the subject of the first sentence? Biden. What is the subject of the second sentence? "You". Who is "you"? Well, it's not referring to juicy_n_seedless and PrincessToiletSparkl diretly. Rather it's taking the accomplishment of Liz (using the context in the previous sentence) being able to (if Biden wins and follows through) effect change in this country without getting the nomination, and generalizing it to "you" (in the more generic form, meaning anyone) can do the same. Liz is effecting change, and you can do it too.
A spokeswoman from the Warren campaign says [Warren's "one man, one woman" response] from last night's CNN Town Hall has amassed 12 million views in 15 hours, accounting for all the places it's been posted.
She‚Äôs kinda good at this whole running for president thing.
Contrast this with a trump response. Not just in style but in substance.  I can‚Äôt believe the numbers are even close in this race she is clearly heads and shoulders above trump in every measure.
Man-o-man-o-witz...  The more I see Warren speak, the more I am engaged.  I haven't fully committed to Warren, yet, but each day is getting closer.
I'm not sure how many of you, like Warren, grew up Methodist or are familiar with the current issues the church has. It is refreshing to have her speak out, much like many do, in favor of support people who just want to live their damn lives without someone using their own faith against them.  I have been lucky to have so many open-minded and loving role models within the Church. In my experience, most of the people who used their faith as a negative have done so in cowardly manner. They never speak up about their prejudice, but vote in silence. The youth of the Church have rejected official stances of the UMC, at an official level even, and I hope that maybe someone like Warren can kick the General Assembly in the ass and support their own clergy for God's sake. It will be ruin in two generations, otherwise.  Just another reason I can see Sen. Warren as our nations ethical leader.
just as a barometer of comparison, the really good fan-made ad of bernie sanders and how the media's coverage of him is incredibly disconnected from who he actually is that took twitter by storm a week or two back got something in the ballpark of 2 million views in 24 hours. this sextupled that amount in a shorter timeframe just on twitter.
I missed the town hall, what did she say, please?
beautiful
Warren has been my number 1 choice since she announced that‚Äôs she‚Äôs running for president.  On top of her platform she‚Äôs unbelievably charismatic.
I think the reason that this is upsetting some people is the final statement. The condemnation of homophobia is fine, but the final jab of, "Assuming you can find one." hits a sore spot. In context Warren is aiming that jab solely at homophobes, which is great. But human brains don't process information purely logically.   That last jab is the subconscious fear for a growing proportion of the population. The rate of never married individuals is at record high and growing. And the rate of never married men is at least 25% higher than never married women. This fear is completely decoupled from homophobia but is also a source of negative reaction to the statement.   Warren did nothing wrong. She merely exposed another issue troubling Americans today. It would be great to hear her at least acknowledge the troubling decline of marriage. Even as simple as tying that fear to how her existing plans would help. A great example would be her plan for early childhood programs. Citing the low marriage rate fear she could tie that to the % of unmarried individuals who cite financial concerns as a barrier and then show how early childhood care would contribute to making raising a family less of an economic burden.
I laughed my ass off at that this morning. A+ burn
For people who haven‚Äôt seen the full response: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr8-Ln3FK64
What a week for her. I'm simply amazed at how her comms team handled the pregnancy discrimination story.
Does anyone have the clip with Spanish subtitles?
Honestly it's great that she can work the media like this.
Possibly an unpopular opinion, but I felt this was a terrible response. I'd be fine if this was her humorous opener and was followed up by a serious answer. The answer just dismisses an actual important question - there are still people who don't accept gay marriage and are having a hard time adjusting. Her response just writes all those people off as undesirable and irrelevant. I would have liked to see her, rather than just ignoring the parts of the population that disagree, explain how she would help change people's minds and pull people over to our side.  This all plays into a bigger problem that's bothering me, where we tend to see people on the other side as enemies rather than potential allies if we can make them change their opinions, so maybe it's just me overreacting.
Isn't the guy who asked her the question one of her big donors? This seems like a setup. He's Morgan Cox, right? It wouldn't be the first time CNN planted friendly questioners in a town hall.  Disclosure: Yes, I'm a staunch Bernie supporter, but pulling fake stunts is not doing much to endear me to Warren.

That‚Äôs what happens when you have years of practice teaching and conveying ideas as well as taking time to come up with through policy proposals.
No one ever says that  EDIT: Jesus people, I was being sarcastic.  https://twitter.com/mikel_jollett/status/1182476728834215936?s=21  I love Warren - chill out! :)
some people prefer truth, others...lies
Happy to hear it. And please take your time.  Deciding who the next president should be is a very big decision that should be taken with as much care as one can do.  As excited as I am by her, and as much as I want everyone else to be on board, there really is no rush to make up your mind. We still have months before the voting starts.  While you are still deciding, and after you make your decision (whoever it is), I hope you always feel welcome here.
What‚Äôs holding you back?
For what it‚Äôs worth, I had a really hard time finding that Bernie video for some reason. Not sure why the campaign didn‚Äôt promote it through official channels more.
Question:  >Thank you for being here.  Let's say you're on the campaign trail and you're approached-  Warren:  >I have been!  Question:  >And a supporter approaches you and says to you, "Senator, I am old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman."  What is your response?  Warren:  >Well, I'm going to assume it's a guy who said that.  And I'm going to say, "then just marry one woman."  I'm cool with that.  Assuming you can find one.
Me too!
She seemed to imply that men who are opposed to gay marriage probably have trouble finding a wife. It's not a gaffe on the same level as "basket of deplorables," but I think it could come back to haunt her in the general.
I think you're right. She landed a good line, she delivered it well, but some people will think, for that last bit alone, that she is attacking them, whether they're homophobic or not. This is still early on, so the line will most likely be forgotten outside of the foxnewsosphere, but they will definitely hammer her on it because at some point, they will need to mix it up from, "She's going to outlaw your hamburgers and your car."   However, I'm glad to see her loosening up, and I know she's had people in her ear telling her that's her weak point -- that she's seen as a stiff, a dork, etc. -- but I think if she keeps the positivity in her message, she will reach people down the line that this line may have offended today.
She did give a serious follow-up, but most people only talk about the first part. CNN cut it out of their clip. You can watch it in OP's link.
>Very different standards for male and female politicians.  you're correct but not at all in the way you seem to think you are, which is pretty funny
She said she'd assume it was a guy (and it was a guy that asked, yeah?) THUS "then marry only one woman". It wasn't presuming a sexist view, it was saying that IF one is going to say "marriage is one man and one woman" THEN IF you're a guy, THEN marry one woman.  That's how I took it.
She's not implying that men are more likely to be homophobic or against same-sex marriage, she really just needed to establish a gender of this hypothetical for her response to land. It would have worked the other way around, as well! I assume she established a man simply because it was a guy asking her the hypothetical.  You gotta dig pretty hard to get "sexism" out of this.
You mean the standards that allow men who assault and prey on women to be elected to office?
A lot of the more vocal anti gay marriage people are male preacher/ politicians (like like pence). I think it was a dog at them not at men
I think she was just saying that so that she could say to marry a woman; by acknowledging that she‚Äôs assuming it‚Äôs a guy, it looks like Warren was implying ‚Äúit could be a woman, and I‚Äôd tell her to marry just a single guy.‚Äù At first, I had the same reaction you did, and while it‚Äôs pretty ambiguous, I don‚Äôt think she meant to say that guys are less likely to support LGBT rights.
Ya'll are overthinking it, she's just setting up the joke.
I thought this was odd as well. I've never heard of a sexist divide on this issue and I did take offense as a male supporter of all marriage.
u/tja928 just did though
FYI: You need to add a `/s` to your comment if you're joking on reddit, especially in political subreddits. It stands for sarcasm. There is no context of verbal speech to know if you're joking or not.
Eh, others don't care about the lies, but just like the idea that Trump is hurting people they don't like  Absolute scum
Completely agree with this statement. Great thing about Warren is she never makes you feel late to the party!
You have to see it, her timing on delivery is damn near perfect.
Thanks
Lol uh sure, making fun of homophobes is a real issue with assholes so I guess she'll lose the asshole vote.
Not at all. She‚Äôs speaking to a guy and she wanted to make a clear statement.  ‚ÄúI would tell this agendered humanoid that xhe should date a person of the opposite sex‚Äù is awkward
I think you are wrong.
I'm a male. I didn't find it offensive. She could have _hypothetically_ assumed it was a  woman, and there are women that hold that belief. She could easily have said, "if you can find a man."
Thanks, had a hard time finding a good place to watch the full video.

>She's not implying that men are more likely to be homophobic or against same-sex marriage,   also, like i posted upthread, even if you interpret this as being the case she would be correct because men *are* and have been more likely to oppose same-sex marriage for as long as pew has been tracking it. [gallup too](https://news.gallup.com/poll/257705/support-gay-marriage-stable.aspx), with similar gaps.

You don't have to dig too hard or far. It was implied in her last sentence and her assumptions.
   She said she'd assume it was a guy THUS "then marry only one woman". It wasn't presuming a sexist view, it was saying that IF one is going to say "marriage is one man and one woman" THEN IF you're a guy, THEN marry one woman.  That's how I took it.
This is how I interpreted it as well.
[there is and has always been a gender gap on this issue](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/).
She said she'd assume it was a guy THUS "then marry only one woman".  It wasn't presuming a sexist view, it was saying that IF one is going to say "marriage is one man and one woman" THEN IF you're a guy, THEN marry one woman.     That's how I took it.
Naw, I don‚Äôt say sarcastic stuff in real life with a different tone or voice.   That‚Äôs part of sarcasm.
She does this huff/eye roll thing as she walks away after saying it that ties it in a nice bow.
It may be perfect because it was rehearsed.  https://twitter.com/queeninyeiiow/status/1183034680855203841?s=21
TBF it‚Äôs a sizable group.
It's more that she might motivate assholes to come out and vote against her.
I agree that she's not attacking men, here.
I don't think it was sexist, but I do think it's short sighted to say something like that to someone who is framed as a "supporter" by the person asking the question.     Warren herself was a Republican up until the age of 47.  At some point, someone or something came along and convinced her that her values simply didn't line up with the Republican party and that she aligned more as a Democrat.     She should keep that in mind and not mock/alienate potential supporters.
She persisted in reading a relevant letter from Coretta Scott King.  Backing up a moment, what are you hoping to gain from having this conversation in the Warren subreddit? Are you trying to understand why we support her, or are you trying to convince us we're wrong?
I'm sorry but this comes off as an argument made in bad-faith. You're clearly missing the context of Warren reading a letter from Coretta Scott King about Jeff Sessions history on the Senate floor and being censured by Mitch McConnell. This was relevant to the debate and multiple men were able to read the letter in full without being censured. She was only breaking the "rules" if you agree with McConnell making up arbitrary rules to better suit the GOP's self interest.   This has been established time and time again. You might want to Google the incident you're referring to, before making another nonsensical comment.
That wasn't a "study" just because it was done by people at NYU.
No, she needed to set up her joke by picking a gender. That's all.    If she'd said, "just for the hypothetical, let's assume it's a guy," would that have been better for you?
Also the person asking the question was a guy
[deleted]
From your linked article: "Today, 66% of women and 57% of men support same-sex marriage."  A 9% difference is hardly a big enough gap to assume anything. I wouldn't even consider less than 10% a "gap" at all.
That's a fair point. But the potential president should work on how she states it. She could have easily said it "well, for a man, marry a woman. Or vice versa if it's a woman and a man". The way she stated it could easily be taken "men are the ones who think this...". Which is a dangerous tone... Especially as a female candidate.
okay, well, if you don't do it on reddit, then enjoy your -100 karma.
Yeah so? This is the same as hiding Winnie the Pooh to appease China.
I'm sure shes very concerned about the fragile male voters who probably would have voted against her anyway.
You‚Äôre being downvoted, and I think I know why. As dems or lefties or whatever, we are often concern-trolled about things with the perspective of assholes, idiots, or always-vote-republicans emphasized. We hear a lot of, ‚Äúwell, if you say *that* the right is going to say *this*,‚Äù and if you follow that logic and try to keep yourself from ever inspiring someone on the right to criticize you, you will never be able to say or do anything. Because here‚Äôs the thing: they‚Äôre *always* going to say bad stuff about us. Assholes are always going to vote against us, and they‚Äôre assholes, so they‚Äôll do it and blame us for it. This is not ever going to be a winning course of action.   This was an excellent bit of crowd work from LW. It‚Äôs funny, it follows her genuinely-held position/beliefs, it‚Äôs engaging, and again- it‚Äôs funny. In these dark, grim times, this kind of thing can make a huge difference.
They were motivated to vote against the dem candidate in 2020 a century ago
She assumed the person's gender.
Anyone with that position is not a supporter.
Howdy. Bit of context on this guy. He's worse than a troll--he's a brainwashed fool. Several months ago I encountered him for the first time and spent several hours beating my fucking head against the wall trying to debate with him. Through the entire "debate", if you can even call it that, he consistently cherry-picked his sources, not even reading them half the time, consistently spouted completely debunked right-wing talking points, and when presented with evidence contrary to his claims, called me brainwashed and kept insisting I'm under the influence of "mileu control", a narrative he spews constantly, everywhere, on reddit.  Ever since then I've been studying the account. I check in on it about once a week or so, and at this point I'm fucking *convinced* he's a paid disinformation agent. He insists T_D is "not what you've been made to believe it is", despite [the mountains of evidence to the contrary.](https://np.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/top/?sort=top&t=all) When I presented him with that exact link and asked him to explain it to me, he deflected and called me brainwashed. He insists that there is an all-encompassing "SJW" movement that is intent on making white males "the other", and that this movement will lead to this country oppressing them the same way that blacks and POC were oppressed in the past.  If you're up for a laugh you should check out his post history. It's a fucking trip.
No, you just don't understand what sexism actually is.   Actual sexism against men is assuming they're inherently incapable of caring for their own children. Or that they're weak for showing emotion. Or they can't wear a color.  Assigning a gender in a hypothetical so it is linear, is not sexist.
>Regardless, it doesn't matter how you spin it, it is sexist. She took a question of a hypothetical "anybody" and interpreted that to mean a guy. A female can very well ask that question. > >Just change the scenario a bit and people would be outraged if it called out females instead.  ...no, they would not be if the data actually backed this up like it does with men, lol. what is this bullshit idea that something which is *literally an observable pattern of social beliefs among men* which are noticeably less present and prominent among women is sexist? are some of you genuinely so fragile that you can't handle the idea that maybe this *is* something that men are genuinely more likely to do than women and, ergo, it is valid to make the assumption that a man would do this and not a woman (particularly given the lack of women in roles or position of power in religion where such beliefs are most present)?
>A 9% difference is hardly a big enough gap to assume anything. I wouldn't even consider less than 10% a "gap" at all.  i like how you can't actually deny that there's a gap here so you have to selectively interpret what is and isn't a meaningful gap. for the record, even doing some extremely broad math based on those numbers suggest a ballpark difference of *sixteen million* or so more women than men supporting same-sex marriages. i would say that's a pretty significant gap!
>Especially as a female candidate.  That's a dangerous tone right there too.  If we run around looking for things that offend us, we will very likely succeed.
It‚Äôs fake internet points. I‚Äôm okay with it.
I don‚Äôt get the reference. Would you please explain?
There is a chance this line will come back to "haunt" here in the general election. It has nothing to do with fragile males or their egos.   I'd question if she's the type to actually support men's right and help fix the family court system.
I don't care about what they say, but I care about whether they vote, and how. "Basket of deplorables" [almost certainly hurt Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplorables#Analysis), and had no redeeming benefits.
I read it as ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming [hypothetically] that it‚Äôs a man.‚Äù
Oh yeah. She definitely hurt this hypothetical person's feelings.
I mean, that's quite literally how the question was framed. It was a supporter asking...
You should be on Fox news. That is a fantastic manipulation of data to make your point.   "Focus on the number of people and not the percentage because it sounds more significant".  Solid.   If you could read, I did deny the gap. It's a statistical insignificant gap when you are guessing the probability that the person asking the question is either male or female. To assume based on those numbers and likelihood is foolish.  edit: Also, it's a 12.7 million person difference. What's shocking is 56 million women are against gay marriage.
That's text. There's no tone in it. You added the tone.  Bottom line: A female candidate making sexist sounding comments about the opposite sex is dangerous in a race where she needs the opposite sex to support her. No different than if/when Trump makes a slanderous comment assuming a woman in a given scenario.  It's concerning that so many are struggling with this concept.
The way I see it.  It is not about fake internet points, it is about conveying meaning.  In every post i make, I am attempting to convey some kind of message. Sometimes it is a feeling, sometimes a thought, and sometimes a joke.  If I make a joke, and the result is dissatisfaction/downvotes, then I am interested in WHY I got downvoted.   Was the joke cruel? Not funny? Or was it not interpreted as a joke at all?  This is just Reddit, so a misunderstanding is not really a big deal. But the ability to communicate via text is a skill worth developing.   At least, that is just my take on it all.
Xi Jin pig looks a lot like Winnie the pooh, or at least he thinks so. Winnie the pooh is banned in China.
If America votes Trump again over this they deserve what they have coming.
Basket of deplorables hurt Clinton because they dropped it, if they had leaned into it instead and made clear the structural problems of Donald Trump are that he's a goddamn fascist, and the David Dukes of the country know that and adore him for it, they might not have had such a problem getting their people to the polls. Instead they apologized, and instead ran on pearl clutching about how rude Donald Trump is to try and win over moderate Republicans.
But what they say is totally related to how they vote.   I agree that was a gaffe and it hurt her. This is not the same. This is excellent.
You certainly can read it that easy but that's not what was said. She'd likely have inserted that word if either she meant it or wanted to clarify.
>"Focus on the number of people and not the percentage because it sounds more significant".  a body of people which would constitute the *fifth largest state in america* if you separated them out isn't significant? news to me, and probably all the people here.  >If you could read, I did deny the gap. It's a statistical insignificant gap  ...no. in absolutely no universe is an 18 point net gender gap a "statistically insignificant" gap. pew's margin of error is about 2.4% in either direction (their sample size is n=1,503). the most you could say is *potentially* the numbers are as close as 64-59, but they could *also* 68-55 because margin of error goes both ways. either way, the gender gap observed by them here is absolutely statistically significant.
You can‚Äôt determine what‚Äôs statistically insignificant for us that way. Statistics isn‚Äôt opinions. Try that on some high school students or something. for anyone to say 9% is insignificant is stupid to begin with but then you keep going. Accept the reality than men are (statistically and observably) more likely to be bigots and do something about it instead of throwing a tantrum
She‚Äôs Electable If You F*cking Vote For Her
That is a great shirt and description.
Need that in a sticker.
2020 is just a master-class on self-fulfilling prophecy (for good or for ill)
People who are concerned about her electability are taking all the wrong lessons from the 2016 election.  Hillary Clinton did not lose the election because of her female-ness.
Yessss omg I‚Äôm so sick of this
This is the most amazing shirt
Can we put this in perspective?  The candidates that are considered "more electable" than Warren according to American voters: (no disrespect to Judaism or LGBT meant, but if gender is an issue, shouldn't any marginalization be?)  * An old white guy who can't finish sentences or accurately remember his own experiences * A really old Jewish white guy who is a democratic socialist, with more baggage than a commuter airline, and suffered a heart attack less than a year ago. * An old white Jewish guy who is a billionaire who is still basically a republican. * A young gay white guy who talks in platitudes, in a really slow monotone voice * Another billionaire white guy who is slightly less old  I mean, if she was running against someone amazingly dynamic like Obama, maybe I could see it, but this, folks, is her competition?  And let's not even get started on the God-emperor Cheese Puff on the other side of the aisle.  Given these facts, am supposed to think that white male privilege is a myth?  LOL.

I am! Next Tuesday as a matter of fact
Just bought one! I feel this so deeply...
And please buy from her official site, not the 1,600 rip offs that have sprung up <\_<
If I may be completely honest I think tons of Democrats love Warren but really don't want to give Trump another woman to run against in 2020. It's not fair or right but I think it's part of the story unfortunately. Many people see him as the worst most dangerous President ever and aren't sure how they feel about allowing him to be the first candidate in history to be opposed by a woman both times.
That could be said of any candidate literally ever. Lmao
You‚Äôre in luck, they‚Äôre available.
I've been thinking about this recently and I really disagree. Hillary was not a perfect candidate, and wasn't immune from valid criticism. But the way we reacted to her downsides as utterly unacceptable, when those same issues in other (read male) candidates would have been understood, justified, critiqued in a reasonable way, or outright ignored (like, ahem rape essays), absolutely was due to her femaleness. The fact that she is now persona non grata in the party she worked for decades to help build (including fundraising for many many down ballot dems) because she dared to run for president is just abborant.
To be honest, theres something to be said about a mature campaign. It's an uphill battle for first time presidential candidates.
A lot of people I talked to, prior to the New Hampshire primary, ultimately chose between her and Amy Klobuchar ...  No insult intended to Senator Klobuchar, but if you're torn between two people who share only title and gender, clearly you weren't paying attention to the debates.
You forgot the binder-throwing, salad-eating-with-a-comb lady.
This is a wrong way to look at things. It doesn't matter that she's a woman running against old white guys. What matters is that she has great policy proposals, in my opinion second best, which can generate turn out.  People should stop viewing politics through a identity lens, and politicians should stop talking about their personal journey, and start talking about fucking plans and policies.  I don't give a fuck that you're gay and served in the army Pete, what are you planning to do for the country, you talking point generator?
Yeah man, i know you said no disrespect to jews but i'm still feeling it. Don't get me wrong, i've come for Sanders for playing up his stereotypical old brooklyn jew shtick, but this is just signalling that Jewishness is a problem and saying "it's okay because Warren deals with sexism". Maybe there are some other Jews here that disagree, but i think it's anti-semitic.   And Pete has been attacked A LOT for being gay, lets not pretend that he's just been given a pass on that completely, but overall i agree that white male privilege is the only reason his campaign has had a chance.

I think warren is electable but to play the devils advocate (a position I think is semi-reasonable here), everyone is completely aware ‚Äúwhite male privilege‚Äù is a thing but people making that statement aren‚Äôt particularly useful or interesting.  Electability is 100% a statement about who we think our country will vote for, and evidence suggests that they might not be willing to vote for a woman and a white male might be a better choice electorally.  You seem to be missing the entire discussion over electability which is, ‚Äúdid Clinton lose, at least in part, because of her sex?‚Äù Moreover, while personally I again agree with you about the issue as a whole, the idea that anyone has a ‚Äúright‚Äù to be president is absurd.  The failure of a candidate can kick off a reasonable discussion on racism or sexism but the idea that ‚Äúwhite male privilege‚Äùis the same between presidential candidates and random white dudes is very unnuanced and misses the very large subtleties (which is not to say white male privilege doesn‚Äôt exist, just that applying it as a moral force in a presidential race is poor politics and not great ethics).     I sometimes hear pro-warren people (mostly my family) complain about things like both women apologizing at the democratic debate when asked for a gift or apology to the other candidates and claim that they were driven by social pressure and male privilege but they miss that those are things which should legitimately make us think twice before electing a female president (though frankly, I think it was just somewhat questionable political instincts which happens to every candidate).
Since we are talking about electability in terms of demographics, I just want to point out that we have a Female vs. Jewish Socialist vs. homosexual. The truth is that none of those demographics are going to lend an advantage against Trump, and for prejudice Christians that exist on both sides of the aisle, a female is by far the least offensive of the three.
That‚Äôs. The. Point.
Where is the sticker link? I want one!
> if you're torn between two people who share only title and gender, clearly you weren't paying attention to the debates.  Honestly it means they like worker bees that get shit done. I'd argue that Warren will work for progressive programs that will make America better, while Klobuchar reinforces the status quo pre-Trump, but in either candidate you have someone that is looking past Jan 2021 into actually being president vs just beating Trump.
I'm all-in for Warren and have been since May.  Amy is my second choice.  I'm not going to promote her here and go into detail on why, but suffice to say it's not because of her title and gender.  It's very presumptive, and problematic, for you to assume anyone who supports two women is doing so just because they are women.

LOL.  Makes sense that those were their two choices and they fell on the side of the person who was being talked about as being electable on TV. MSNBC/CNN/NPR stopped talking about Warren post iowa.
On purpose, because she isn't considered electable either.
Yes, but personal experience helps voters understand how candidates will make decisions that may not be outlined in policy proposals (eg handling natural disasters). For example, one of the reasons I dig Liz is I know she's an academic who will study the problem, seek expert advice, and choose the smartest course of action.
Bernie supporters are always blind to sexism and male privilege.  Because it doesn't directly benefit Bernie; it doesn't exist.  Another casualty of blind loyalty to a man rather than an ideal.
My point is pretty clear.  You can be from any group, including traditionally marginalized groups, as long as you are a man.  Then you are electable.  Go build your strawman elsewhere.
Yeah, I realize that a lot of people don't notice sexism.  Or care.
Reported for obvious sexism.
* democratic socialist. Bernie isn‚Äôt an actual socialist is my understanding.
I think this guy means it's more about demographics for Trump, who has preyed upon and victimized women all his life. He has a way of dismissing women that brainwashed those watching.
Yeah but my whole point is a woman would be the same opponent demographic twice in a row. Trump didn't run against a Jewish man last time or a homosexual last time he ran against a woman and my point is less about Warren being a woman and more about people being afraid to have him run against a woman TWICE.
 [https://teespring.com/stores/jackie-ann-ruiz-draws](https://teespring.com/stores/jackie-ann-ruiz-draws) There's an explicit and bleeped version of both the shirt and sticker. :)
Just click on the image and it will take you to a site.
That is a good analysis ...  I hope that was what was actually meant.
I wish it was just me being presumptive ...  I was literally told that that was the case by 3 or 4 people.
It is pretty presumptive. Though, it is what happens all the time. People go to this assumption too easily and early.
Not about ideology, I can understand ...  But at some point you need to dig into the policy, otherwise you might as well be voting on who's wearing the best tie, for all it has to do, with actually being an elected official.
I strongly disagree. You are making a huge generalization about academics, and ascribing characteristics to her, which she might not have. Liz might posses all the attributes you think an academic should posses, but I would argue that there are *a lot* of academics who think they are the smartest person in the world, and won't listen to any advice. Again, the story shouldn't matter, what should matter is what the candidate stands for.
Let me give you a pro-Warren and rule 8 friendly translation of what i want to say.   Dealing with your words having unintended consequences and taking responsibility is part of why I love Warren. It's so refreshing to see a candidate acknowledge these things without getting defensive or angry. She is such a warm person with an overabundance of empathy that I can't believe it doesn't touch anyone who hears her speak. It's why the *vast majority* of people with a different kind of attitude support a different progressive on social media instead of Warren.   No strawman, i'm directly calling out your words and what they mean. Nobody needed to bring up the Jews in relation to Warrens electability at all. We have nothing to do with it, and if Jewish people get to be electable, fuck yeah! Women should be too and the world would be a better, more loving place for it. I live for hating Sanders and Bloomberg, but they have enough baggage that being Jewish shouldn't have even popped into your head for electability concerns enough to specifically preempt my concerns before you said it. I don't know you well enough to say if you are an anti-semite, but this is disrespectful to *me*.
What? I‚Äôm behind warren.  The entire point of the electability argument is the concern that people are sexist and won‚Äôt vote for a woman‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt think I am being unreasonable for pointing out that women in politics have to be very careful about what they say because they are held to a higher standard
Well at least on the electability point, people like my dad, a Democrat, don‚Äôt understand the difference
I don't know what they said to you. I'm responding to what you said here:  > if you're torn between two people who share only title and gender, clearly you weren't paying attention to the debates.  I've watched every single debate. I like both candidates. Not everyone chooses candidates for the same reasons as you.
[deleted]
That makes sense. I didn't mean to make assumptions about all academics. Mostly I wanted to explain why personal candidate details can help us "fill in the gaps" so to speak where there may not be policy proposals. And the qualities I mentioned pertaining to Liz fit better when understood vis-a-vis the other candidates instead of as qualities belonging to all scholars. Sorry if that wasn't clear!
You are choosing it to be disrespectful.  Just bringing up whether or not voters will use it against them is not anymore anti-semite than the people who bring up gender.  Have you met America?  Tens of millions of us are awful and hateful.    My point is and always will be that every single category of marginalized people will be more acceptable and considered electable in this country over a woman.  Hell, the left won't even admit that sexism exists.  Usually when they are launching a diatribe about how the only possible reason that anyone would support Warren is because of "identity politics".   They are just as bad as the racists and sexists on the right who see women and POC and assume:  they only go hired because of their gender and race.  I am sick and tired of sexism being effing ignored.  And I say this as a woman of color who knows full well what racism feels like too.  Go build your strawman elsewhere.
It‚Äôs definitely an optics problem. He should just rebrand himself as a FDR new deal politician instead.
Absolutely ...  As another redditor said, both Senators are looking past the election towards actually governing, which is a laudable goal.
Yeah, Elizabeth Warren is different ...  But that's why we're all here, isn't it?
I don't think leave jews alone or strawman mean what you think they do.
Yeah, I think Sanders (and to a lesser extent Warren) miss the point when they say that progressive policies are popular policies. They are, but the Democrats have such an image problem that when those policies are couched in the name of progressivism or democratic socialism, people will vote against them.
Continue to purposely ignore my actual words so that you can feel aggrieved.  The good news is that you've successfully distracted from the sexist argument.  Mission Accomplished!  Let's talk about men.  And only men.  And how aggrieved they are.  Never ever speak about sexism; it makes men uncomfortable.  And random men's comfort takes precedence at all times.
I don‚Äôt see the problem with the progressive label. That‚Äôs what they are. It‚Äôs the socialist word that has the negative connotations  that make my parents think of communism.
You can play suffering olympics elsewhere, just stop being an anti-semite.
Sexism is "suffering olympics"; simply pointing out that a candidate is "Jewish" is "anti semitism"  Up is down, down is up.  The irony.
In Shift, Warren Says She‚Äôll Forgo Big Money Events if Nominated
As a Bernie supporter (Warren is my #2), I kind of feel this is a pretty blatant move to say:  >"Hey, if your guy drops out, you've got a home here. I hear your concerns about corruption and big money influence, and I take them seriously. You've had Bernie's back because he's unequivocally had yours. So will I. Also hey if you wanna switch sides that's cool too!"   Warren was already a lock for my #2, but this genuinely excites me. I'm not a fan of some moves that she's made, but this tells me she's listening. It also wouldn't surprise me if there's been some calls between her and Sanders in the last week. I'm behind Sanders for as long as he thinks he's up for it, but anything that closes the (admittedly tiny given the rest of the Democratic field) gap between Sanders and Warren is an absolute win in my book.   This doesn't feel like a half-hearted or hollow gesture to me. Not given Warren's history.
This is a play for Bernie voters. Her fundraising stance going into the general has been one of the more common criticisms of Warren that Bernie voters have leveled against her thus far. By stating this publicly - one day after Bernie says his campaign is going to change after his heart attack - clearly means she is going for his voters.   I seriously doubt she is going to do anything to financially cut herself (or the rest of the party) off at the knees, but she is making a play for voters that are more in line with her positions on a wide swath of policy. They are also the group that gave Bernie the largest 3Q fundraising totals. Combining Bernie's and her fundraising efforts would be huge in the primary. His voters would be nice to have in her camp as well.     Her campaign continues to impress the hell out of me.
Fantastic news! Corporations and wealthy individuals have no business influencing politicians through donations, so it's good to see Warren stand up for her beliefs here. The people of this country are more than capable of funding a Democratic candidate through grassroots donations, so begging the corporate elite is not something we should ever be doing. A ban on corporate donations to the DNC should be the next step - let's get this toxic influence out of our party once and for all
I think this was her goal all along. She just needed to build out her donor list in order to know that it was a viable option.
Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this.  I guess a "grassroots fundraiser" (a la Bernie) model *might* work, but we're looking at a billion-dollar campaign. It's a big risk. But so was her current fundraising model, so who knows!  Edit: [She's now saying no PAC money, either.](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1181988861595078659?s=19) That *does* seem to me like a clear mistake. It's going to cause endless nitpicking anytime she's working with a union or ideological group.
Yes! This is exactly what I was hoping would happen
One of her best decisions. Hope she follows thru w this.
Can someone clarify if I understand this correctly? This means she won't actively seek out big contributions from rich individuals at the $2k limit? So they can still donate but she's just not pandering to them?
Guarantee this doesn't appease her critics.
Can't help but remember how the person with the most money lost last go-round. I think as long as the campaign has enough to field an infrastructure on the ground, racking up wads of cash is less important even than selfie lines that make you look like the people's candidate. Yay free media!  Plus big money events are bad news. 47%? Deplorable? Both at big donor events. The pressure to say something off-script to "insiders" makes it more likely to put one's foot in one's mouth. Probably why Trump doesn't allow cell phones at his big money bashes...
Matthew Yglesias tweeted [this:](https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1181945731235663877)  > The other problem is that now every time Warren has a second- or third-degree interaction with a donor it will be reported as a hypocrisy story while Trump continues to collect bribes through his hotels on a daily basis with no reaction.  And frankly, I'm concerned. On the one hand, this choice strengthens and sharpens her anti-corruption campaign, which is exactly the right sort of story to run against Trump. On the other, it sets the standard so high, and if Trump has taught us anything it's that public feeling sours faster on someone who appears to fall short of their own standards than someone who proudly drops their standards to the ground.  High risk, high reward.
She and Sanders are already out raising Biden without the big fundraisers in the primary. If one of them takes the nom then we just need to have small donors keep up that momentum   And Clinton out raised Trump and still lost. Money helps but we need to get people out to vote  (I did just give her another $20 though to show my continued support)
As a Bernie and Warren supporter, I do not feel comfortable supporting any candidate who takes big dollar donations. This is a step in the right direction without a doubt.  The next dem nominee needs to be one of 100% grassroots power or we lose the moral high ground, which is a risk I'd rather not take.
This is ballsy. Good, but ballsy. This just means we‚Äôre all going to have to contribute to win this thing.
Let's be clear: the DNC will gladly take that money, but Warren herself won't be attending the events.
YES. This was one of my big concerns. I'm glad to hear it
Look- I feel that Warren backing up what she says, and completely avoiding any notion of "she's a puppet for ______" is absolutely a valid decision. If you're rising because you are who you say you are, why take a turn that would cast doubt on that?
Given the grassroots funding both she and Bernie have been able to clear so far in this campaign, maybe whomever needed to be convinced in the Warren campaign that forgoing big money can actually work, has now been convinced.  Maybe the corruption news over the last few weeks has also made it more of an imperative to run a campaign that‚Äôs the least beholden to it.
Sorry, but I think this is a terrible idea. Large donations don't automatically represent a corporate agenda like most PAC contributions. Warren can exercise discretion over who attends those events while setting ambitious small-donation total goals. I worry now that if she gets the nomination, she'll be at a fundraising disadvantage.
Is it a shift? I'm pretty sure she's been pretty consistent that she wouldn't host Big Money fundraisers, but that she wouldn't refuse Big Money donations if they were freely given.
Is it a shift if she's never actually stated her position one way or the other? That's just 'taking a position.'
Nothing on r/politics about this and both of my attempts to post there have been denied for some reason
People will downvote me for this but it's a huge mistake.  It's not only about raising money for the presidential race, but also for congressional races who will elect democrats who are going to enact Warren's agenda. This is why democrats get wiped out during congressional elections (sans 2018) they are obsessed with the presidential race and then wonder why some states like wisconsin, Michigan and north carolina are so gerrymandered in favour of the republicans.  This is incredibly shortsighted and naive and it feels like pandering to voters she doesn't need to reach out to (very liberal activists).
Good. Doing otherwise would massively undercut her arguments against lobbying, big money politics, etc. I know this will make many people nervous but shit has to change at some point. And that is why I am voting for her - she‚Äôs gonna change this shit.
Warren supporter. Not worried at all about her taking the money from Corps and jumping ship on the middle class. I trust Warren. This is a non issue for me. I'd feel the same way about Sanders.
I know this was a sticking point  amongst some (not all) Bernie fans who wished she'd change her mind,  claiming it made her "fundamentally corrupt" or whatever.  The  optimist in me thinks "Well, she did what they wanted; logically, they  should like her now, right?" But the realist in me thinks, "Nope.  The Busters will find something new to smear her with, as always."
Ugh.  The reality of it is that a viable general election campaign is *fucking expensive.*  You fix the problem of undue influence of money in politics by getting elected and passing legislation, not by unilaterally disarming so you don't get elected in the first place.  You have to win the fight that you're already in before you can create the fight you want.
This is fine. She's going to have plenty of money. Creepy dark money groups and somewhat less shady Super PACs will do what they want still. She can't work to stop that kind of money over the next four years if she took that money to get elected.
right now it is a means to an end.
On the one hand I‚Äôm glad to hear it, but on the other, not unilaterally disarming made sense considering what we‚Äôre up against. This is going to be TOUGH, no doubt.
Another thing someone pointed out is that looking back at the past few cycles some of the gaffes that stuck with candidates the longest- Obama's "bitterly clinging to guns and religion" comment in '08, Romney's "the lower 47% of earners are worthless mooches" comment in '12, and Hillary's "basket of deplorables" comment in '16- were all said at private fundraisers with rich donors. While I don't see Warren making that sort of mistake even if she did do those, that's still a risk being mitigated.
I feel like I need a little help here, because this isn't as simple as just saying "corporate money."   This means the Warren campaign itself won't hold closed-door fundraisers, won't accept PAC money or lobbyist donations, and won't accept corporate donations (distinct from individual donations from people who work for a company) right?   However, this still includes fundraising for the DNC (which she's been doing this week) as long as the fundraisers are open door and don't have fossil fuel donors on the guest list, by my understanding.   My point is the money comes from all over, and it makes it really frustrating when people knock a candidate for "corporate money," when that could mean one of like 10 things. It just makes it easier to move goalposts around and claim that a candidate is being "corrupted." Hell, even Warren's last Senate campaign where she took some non-individual donations were mostly from organizations like Emily's List. Pretty sure she only got 15k from actual corporate donors.   Am I off base on any of this? I think Warren's pledge is great and all, but I feel like this issue has gotten so twisted in the past few months that it's pretty meaningless.
Good now maybe this get the Bots to shaddap about their dumb argument of why warren.
I‚Äôm torn. I echo the sentiment that this could prove unwise in the general, but then again, Liz is just so often *right* about things that I ought to trust her.   I don‚Äôt want any more billion dollar elections that last for 3 years. Maybe she needs to show us that it‚Äôs possible to do it another way - and that principles can be worth more than any amount of money.
Good. I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious at this point that money doesn‚Äôt win elections and that people are sick and tired of corporate influence over our elections.   If money is the factor that will decide the election, Trump is going to win. But I don‚Äôt think that how it works.
I think her previous position didn't make any sense. Glad she's all in. The "fuck big bankers" candidate cannot be cozying up to billionaires at any point.
Can't say I think this is a good idea, honestly.
Honestly think this is a misstep. I want to win more than I want absolute purity.
I need to hear a strategy behind this. I want to believe it'll work but we need to see a plan.
Does anyone have data on what % of a campaign's fundraising comes from these "big money events"? I'd love to know for Obama's '08 campaign especially, since he thrived on the sort of grassroots donations Warren can grab but also held the big money events.  The money is going to go somewhere, whether she holds these events or not. More than likely it'll go to her. If not, it'll go down-ballot. Either way, I think she's fine with this move and it's a smart one.
So if she's not taking big money when she's the nominee.....What are the threshold amount going forward?  Can she make money at DNC events and what is the cap? Individual donors is it maxed at 2800 or is it more for the General? Can organizations like NNU,  Moveon.org,  New Democrat Coalition Super PACs contribute at all or is that not allowed? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.    I have mixed feelings but I think everyone eventually will be on board and work twice has hard to make her President Warren.
Yay? I guess.   &#x200B;  Honestly, this is one of the least important things on my list. I don't care who she gets money from as long as she does what she's going to say and makes it to where we stop putting children in concentration camps.
I disagree with this choice and agree with Matt Yglesias here   https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1181943960891219973

Can I ask a general question to everyone in the sub, if you read plz answer sincerely; I love this lady, she's what America needs right and side by side she's lockstep with Bernie in some policies and others she's better about them because she takes the better approach of incorporating capitalism with the kind of soft socialism we all know and would appreciate in our society. Its early to say but should she take on Sanders as a vp choice or someone else similar like Hakeem Jefferies or Abrams?
This is a really idiotic move. You need to raise a lot more money to beat the republicans. I wish dems did not act so foolish when it comes to raising cash.
If it's bad optics for politicians and rich donors to meet in private away from the public, does this mean that Warren is no longer going to the DNC fundraiser?
My concern is that she legitimately doesn‚Äôt understand *why* people are upset about her taking corporate money in the general, and is just responding to pressure.  Edit: typo
The key word is events. She will still take big money just not do the events. It's a step in the right direction, but come on just believe in your message and grassroots and swear off the corrupting influence of big money. I am so tired of having to push and push and push politicians to do the right thing because their big donors want them to do the wrong thing. Just cut the cord, put down the opioid that is big money it is killing the party.
Okay, so at first I was all for her getting on board with no big money. Bernie and Yang do that and are doing well. But then I was corrected, this is actually just big money events, so not really a change in policy, but a PR spin on not taking donations. I don't care for that.
So this doesn‚Äôt seem like pandering to anyone here?
No big money ‚Äúevents,‚Äù but what about big money checks? Is there any real difference?
I wonder if both of their appearances on Colbert will have anything to do with this announcement.
[removed]
> This is a play for Bernie voters.   Yes and no. I'd say it's much more likely her campaign simply didn't expect quite the volume of grassroots support she is getting. They made a safe assumption that it would be non-viable in the general which is completely reasonable. They've since done the math and realized "lolfuckit".
I think she knows that any big money donor who wants to help her can donate to a PAC and her hands are clean, and she can raise enough on small/mid dollar to run a solid ground game and more pointed ad spending
I'm a Bernie supporter, but I'm finding myself torn between him and Liz lately. So let me say, this announcement from her really does a lot to quell some of the doubts I've had about her. She's an easy second choice for any Bernie person, and I'm starting to realize that if the more mainstream liberal types don't hate her like they hate him, and the PPP people love her obviously, she might be like...a compromise candidate between our two sides. I don't want to do the 2016 fight again. I want us all strongly behind someone. It sure isn't Biden, and after this move by Liz, I'm fairly sure it's her.
What was the change the Bernie campaign announced?
> They are also the group that gave Bernie the largest 3Q fundraising totals. Combining Bernie's and her fundraising efforts would be huge in the primary. His voters would be nice to have in her camp as well.  Does anyone have any figures on how many people are donating to both Warren and Bernie?  My wife and I both like them both but are slightly split between who we like as our main candidate and who we like as our backup candidate but we contribute to both campaigns almost equally. My gut says we‚Äôre not that unusual in that regard but I‚Äôd be curious to see exactly how that breaks down.
Yup, that‚Äôs exactly how I see it. It also makes me look at the timing of recent events and go hmmmm. Could be way off in left field, but just a gut feeling.
It's smart because maybe Bernie will drop out based on health and that Liz is surging. Also Bernie is friends with Liz so that definitely means he'll be pushing them to her if she's the nomination or likely one (depending upon timing).
Sure is.
Her play for Bernie voters here is too transparent. People know that big money is big money, and is corrupting, whether it comes at an event, or in your mailbox. I‚Äôm a sanders voter who has been warming to Warren but this attempt to trick people is disheartening, why should I trust someone who clearly is trying to fool me?
>Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this.   >   >I guess a "grassroots fundraiser" (a la Bernie) model might work, but we're looking at a billion-dollar campaign. It's a big risk. But so was her current fundraising model, so who knows!  I thought the same thing at first, but there is going to be some serious big $$ behind whatever DNC candidate is nominated whether they want it or not.  Warren's campaign can say no to big fund raisers, but blunders, super pacs etc can do their own thing.
I was/am a big bernie supporter and donated to him in the last primary several times. This year I‚Äôve been holding my donations for whoever comes out of the primary (I hope Sanders or Warren, but literally **anyone** running is getting my donations). I like this move by Warren. It will resonate with a lot of people.
Conversely, as a Sanders' supporter, it makes me much more comfortable with her candidacy.
I don't think this is a mistake. Context: I'm a Bernie supporter.   I'm going to throw my support behind the democratic nominee regardless. This just makes me support Warren if she gets the nomination more enthusiastically.  Also I think there are many other donors currently supporting other candidates... And many non-donors that will ALL become donors to the nominee during the election.   Also while she may not take PAC money directly, I'm betting liberal and progressive PACs will be running anti-Trump (or Pence) ads in the general to support the democratic nominee regardless.
I was thinking the same thing but that thread convinced me it was the right move:  https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1181954574715949056?s=20

If the people who would have donated the max to her campaign at a standard fundraiser are only willing to do that if they are provided intimate, closed door access, then they are not patriots. They are the problem.   No quid pro quo. Get in a selfie line like everyone else!  But if those people believe in her and want to do what they can to help Warren, they can still donate the max. No one is stopping them with this change. They just don‚Äôt get the promise of access like they do with other candidates. Many won‚Äôt like it, but the ones that won‚Äôt and expect their money to give them increased access and influence are the problem with our politics and country, so f‚Äôem! The entitlement and superiority that people with larger assets feel they are owed is a cancer.   Just look at Zuckerberg‚Äôs comments and actions... especially lately... it‚Äôs disgusting.  Edit: this isn‚Äôt really directed at your comment... I went off on a bit of a rant once I started typing, so please don‚Äôt take it personally üòò
That means she's heavily dependent on getting people enthused and amped up enough to donate. Bernie and Warren are pretty much the only two I can imagine pulling this off because some people don‚Äôt find Biden as charismatic as other candidates.  That's pretty risky, but could pay off big if she can keep in control of the media cycles. I could really see her using that as a boost in the general, give a lot of credence to the idea of fighting for the middle class.
Money in presidential campaigns really doesn't matter (as long as you have enough to run a real campaign of course), and Warren will have no trouble fundraising.   I think this is a move to start taking some of Bernie's support as well.
I don‚Äôt have any mixed feelings at all. Her having more moral clarity makes it easier for her to win the general.
> That does seem to me like a clear mistake.  I think it demonstrates shes going for votes and not money, and treating all votes the same, which is really admirable. It's going to do well shutting down Clinton comparisons. Also a pretty innocuous way to potentially siphon off Sanders supporters.
Maybe it's time to end the "billion dollar campaign"
[deleted]
This was probably based on solid data the campaign has, that tells them that Democrats who want to give her $2800 will do so whether they get to meet her at a fundraiser or not.  Also, her statement doesn't rule out headlining fundraisers for the DNC that could bring in $10M per event which would effectively be available for her campaign.
While you are correct, Bernie still managed to raise the most money. It can work
I‚Äôm not that worried about the PAC money. The Democratic PACs are going to do what they do regardless of what she says.
agree
Yeah I get the messaging this needs for people but I feel like she's going to have to go back on it. I don't want to lose just because the Bernie crowd insists any money is evil. And if you look at how S4P is framing it, its that they don't believe her and Sanders didn't need to change. So I don't think this wins those people over. That's the positive aspect gone.   This feels like a tactical error that will just give people more room to criticize. Hopefully they have a good plan for how money is going to be spent. I guess if everything that would go directly to her goes to the DNC instead for down ballot spending the net result is still good. That is hopefully the plan.  I still want the money out of it, but I want to win and *then* make it the last election won where money means speech.
I believe so. They can still donate if they want, just like anybody else, but won‚Äôt be actively sought out or catered to.
That's okay, because ultimately this is about doing the right thing.
It tackles the #1 criticism Bernie supporters have said about her. If her instinct is Bernie will drop in the polls or even drop out for health reasons, this overcomes that one objection.   Sure, a percentage won‚Äôt be swayed by it. But that‚Äôs probably a group that‚Äôs never going to support her anyway. If it works for 60-70% of people on the fence coming over from Bernie to Liz, that could be very significant.
It does make me a lot more comfortable with supporting her enthusiastically if she gets the nom.  I'm still planning on voting Bernie no matter what, but I'm voting Dem for the general, and I think she's making the right move here
Nope.  Next up. She's not supporting Medicare for all hard enough because I can read minds and she took dirty corporate money (even though it's mostly retirees and universities) from the Senate race and  transferred it.  Edit: Guess I needed the /s
she's a woman, so the second tweet:  >The other problem is that now every time Warren has a second- or third-degree interaction with a donor it will be reported as a hypocrisy story  will most likely happen b/c sexism.
[deleted]
Let me preface this by saying I ultimately love Obama, but:  Obama followed a similar model to the one you are describing. He only did small donations during the primary, then went fairly hog-wild during the general. He took a ton of money from Wall St. Then he passed TARP, bailed out the banks, and let thousands of people lose their homes. Warren fought for direct assistance to homeowners and Obama's economic team (Wall St folks) wouldn't let her into the fold.  It was precisely because he took so much money from Wall St that he was beholden to them. Warren will avoid this.
I'm also scared. But anti-corruption is her brand. So this will set up a very clear contrast. And I'm betting they are raising way more money than they anticipated ‚Äî so they are confident they'll have enough to compete. (Also, doesn't mean DNC can't hold big fundraisers.)
I think she would struggle to sell an anti-corruption message while doing the same things that corrupt politicians do though. Even if she‚Äôs careful about who is coming to these fundraisers, it‚Äôs still a bad look if the entire point of her campaign is to eliminate corruption and make government work for actual people rather than just the rich and powerful. She has to walk the walk, which is something she‚Äôs been criticized for not doing.   This also is going to get a lot of Bernie supporters on her side if she were to get the nomination, and we‚Äôre going to need that big time during the general. It‚Äôs definitely possible to have a grassroots movement as long as the people involved are energized, and will help to bring energy to her campaign
She isn't refusing large donations - she is refusing to do events where she meets with these donors behind closed doors.  If executives donate to her campaign she won't say no to their money, she just isn't giving them special access to her campaign.
Clinton outraised Trump by a huge amount last time around and still lost. Besides, Warren is much better at raising money from the grassroots, so we can easily make up for this by raising money from the real people of this country, instead of the wealthy elite.
Bernie has shown that fundraising isn‚Äôt everything. I‚Äôd rather have a candidate who isn‚Äôt a corporate shill than one that can win while being a sellout.
It was "in the primary" previously, now she's stated she won't do them in the general either.
I agree....I think we're over estimating how much people are willing to donate. And underestimating the type of organization Trump's team is putting together this time. It's not going to be slapped together w/ RNC proping it up...it legit has ground game and strategy.
It's already up. There's a post with this article and over 100 comments.
From the article.  > The campaign said that she would ensure state and national parties ‚Äúhave the resources they need,‚Äù if nominated. Ms. Warren headlined a Democratic National Committee event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another upcoming D.N.C. event.  She's still willing to help raise money for the DNC and down-ballot candidates. She's just not going to hold large donor fundraisers for herself.
Big money donors can still donate to the DCCC, etc.
The Electoral College needs to go, Warren wants to abolish it.
Honestly the Senate is even worse than the EC in this regard. Why does Wyoming or Rhode Island get the same number of Senate votes as California or Texas? Like the EC the aggregate effect is that the smallest, whitest states in the country have an outsized influence on the process, and they make the Senate lean more to the right than what Americans would actually elect if they were represented proportionally.
I doubt we'll ever get rid of the EC (not without an army of progressives we don't have) but we can start by changing at the state level how Electoral Votes are allocated. But I'm glad Warren is talking about it.
Good!   My vote should count the same as yours, regardless of whether I live in Florida or California or Iowa or Montana.
Also, Hillary Clinton actually won by 3 million votes, a fact that pundits sometimes want you just to forget about.
For everyone that may not be aware, the 538 electors is arrives at based on # of Representatives (435) + # of US Senators (100) + DC electors (3).  What's frustrating about the electoral college is the number of electors is complete bullshit.  Yes, the house is largely representative of the US population, but for one, I don't agree with the capping of representatives. There should be more US representatives which would increase the electoral votes for each state and may be even more representative of the population.  The addition of 100 more electoral votes based on the number of US senators is absurd. This is where it really throws our of whack the electors by state. Each state gets two, whether they deserve them or not, plus one for a representative. This is why Wyoming gets 3. DC gets 3 because of some arbitrary law allowing them electors, but never more than that of the lowest state.
The Electoral College is completely indefensible. Almost every American institution is hell-bent on contorting democracy.
God this topic is so frustrating to me. Let's dispel some myths:  &#x200B;  1. The electoral college is not about rural vs. urban. Equally important to the electoral college is how big your borders are. This benefits small New England states while disadvantaging states like Texas. In addition to this, low population density doesn't mean that you're more rural. For example Nevada has the 10th lowest population density, but 94% of them live in cities, which is 3rd highest in the country. Because of these two factors the percentage of urban citizens has essentially no correlation with the voting power that each citizen gets in the electoral college. 2. California and New York will not "determine" the election results. First of all, Texas and Florida have larger populations than New York. Second of all California and New York are only 18.44% of the US population. The rest of the country has far more say than those two states. 3. Majority politics isn't bad. When the end choice cannot be split, as is the case with president, letting the majority choose is better than letting the minority choose. You really have to do some mental gymnastics to come to the conclusion that the minority should be telling the majority what to do. Having said that, I wouldn't be opposed to considering making the executive be controlled by a board rather than a single person. Most of this is just Republicans trying to gain advantage at the cost of democracy. Some of it is people with a minority opinion getting upset that their opinions aren't more popular.
She's really tuned in to what the people in my sort of circles want to see in U.S. politics - no electoral college, term limits, education reform, healthcare reform, banking regulations, gun control...  I don't know what my demographic would be, but the worldview of the people I tend to run with are left-leaning in most ways but are getting a little bit exhausted by the PC culture war stuff - and I like that she's not hammering that side of things too much.   Also, I haven't been seeing much about her foreign policy. Is she weak in that area or am I just missing it?
I'm glad she's running on this.  This is the only way all other reforms become permanent.
Shut up and take my vote!
Are there any states that use a mini-electoral college to vote for governor? Like award electors per county or something?
Changing over from first past the post voting to a rank order or single transferable voting system will have WAY more impact on ALL aspects of the electorate and party system than changing the EC ever will.

How is this - certainly valuable and educational - discussion related to the campaign? Does the president have a role in abolishing the EC? Is a discussion about abolishing the EC motivating progressives more than triggering older more conservative voters?
How is she proposing to do it?
[deleted]
There truly is something called the 'tyranny of the majority.'  But in modern times with our interconnected technology and hyper public perfect profiles, I think that anyone with a public profile might be more likely to compete to be as good as they can.  So although historically I have been against pure democracy, I think maybe we could have a truly democratic election with out the electoral college.    What kind of bothers me is the obvious political talking points Elizabeth Warren is using.  She seems to be hyper aware of what she says to pander to the public.  She is truly an academic, so I don't think she is saying what she truly believes the way she would truly want to say it.  But I truly hope that she uses these political talking points to gather a more secure political base, she would be amazing with political power.  (She already has been.)
Funny thing... as a political point, it might make sense, but it's not going to happen before this election, and opening up a constitutional convention to change it, down the road, is a recipe for all kind of disaster (have you not been getting all the emails about how we're 6 states away from a right-wing-driven move to hold a constitutional convention?).  Meanwhile, last time I looked, Bernie Sanders does very well on the electoral math, compared to pretty much every other Democratic Candidate.
Frankly, I think it's a horrible idea.  Getting rid of the Electoral College essentially disenfranchises all but high-density urban areas.    It sure would be better if the Democrats actually ran candidates who address lower-density, rural areas, rather than treating them as flyover country.  (Of course it would also be a good thing if we got gerrymandering under control.)
We've been having this argument since the drafting of the Constitution, which never would have been ratified without the Connecticut Compromise.  Let's not go through that again.  Our country is polarized enough already.  We're never going to get enough states to adopt the NPVIC for it to go into effect.  Never mind the issue of more populous states vs less populous states...it benefits Democrats over Republicans.  Even if *did* go into effect, it wouldn't stay in effect for long, because Republicans would nullify it as soon as they could.  This is an unwinnable fight and a waste of time.  I wish people would put their effort toward an *achievable* goal instead, like an interstate compact to get rid of winner takes all.
The problem with the Senate is that it's power has increased to far more than it was every supposed to have and it no longer serves it's original purpose.  Senator don't really represent their state's interests anymore.
Taking a basic US history class would give you that answer.   >The Connecticut Compromise (also known as the Great Compromise of 1787 or Sherman Compromise) was an agreement that large and small states reached during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 that in part defined the legislative structure and representation that each state would have under the United States Constitution. It retained the bicameral legislature as proposed by Roger Sherman, along with proportional representation of the states in the lower house, but required the upper house to be weighted equally among the states. Each state would have two representatives in the upper house.
I agree. Warren wants to abolish the filibuster, this is stupid. Abolish the Senate instead then we won't have to worry about the filibuster.
Um... because we're a Republic comprised of States.  And that's how the Constitution was negotiated and written.
I think we can easily see it repurposed so that it votes the way of the popular vote. That Interstate Voter Compact has been gaining ground for years and there are plenty of states left that would join it if their legislatures get recaptured by Democrats and if said Democrats don‚Äôt chicken out like in NV and ME.
Another option is to overturn the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 and expand the House beyond 435 members. This would serve two purposes:   1.) Make the House more representative of the people*  2.) Increase the number of electoral votes in more populous states   *The Constitution originally called for 1 representative for every 30,000 people. Today we are closer to 1 for every 750,000 people.
we will call a constitutional convention at some point. Unless America completely collapses before then. If it does --- it's going to be because we stopped amending our constitution. But anyway. It's absolutely possible and "WE CAN DO THIS!"
I think getting rid of the EC is a lot more likely than some of the other shit people want to do, tbh.
Also, it'd be nice for liberals in Alabama and conservatives in California to have an impact on presidential elections. That alone would probably significantly drive up voter turnout, which would have positive ripple effects up and down our political system.
She didn‚Äôt win the election though.
GOP wanting to preserve it are implicitly admitting most people hate them.
Doesn‚Äôt really matter how you slice it or what points youre making, the bottomline is, the presidency should be determined by whoever gets the most votes.  There are no disadvantages and advantages for either party if that were the case.
[deleted]
One citizen = One vote.    That's all that should matter. Borders, city size, party lines, it's all irrelevant. One citizen, one vote. Anything else is political chicanery.
a redistribution of powers during a constitutional convention would be ideal. Right now people only pay attention to the presidential elections and therefore the presidency has become more and more powerful. More than it was supposed to be. I would be keen to see us move to a parliamentary system or something similar.
I think she seems to have solid stances on foreign policy. The reason you don't hear about them much is that they are complicated nuanced issues that are really challenging to distill down a cable news type format. Also headlines like "Warren supports tactful nuanced leveraging of broad diplomatic tools" doesn't exactly generate a lot of buzz.  She does get a bit into it during her appearance on Pod Save America which you might enjoy. [Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUvqJ6VpXf0)
Pretty sure it would be unconstitutional, for the same argument as [Reynolds v. Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims).
Bc it's a 2 party system?
I saw a tweet and posted it dude.  It's literally her tweet. She tweeted it. She wants to abolish it.
The only way to abolish it is not solely up to executive power. She is only saying that she would support its abolition should a convention be opened to expunge it. I believe the president is able to call an event like that, and it would probably only work with a democratic majority in the house and the senate.
There are vastly more rural voters in California than there are in Wyoming. The electoral college has nothing to do with representing rural interests. That's just a modern red herring that people come up with to try and justify its continued existence.
Hell thats what they do now. Ohio, Florida a couple of others. If your state isn‚Äôt a swing state why waste time campaigning in it. At least popular vote means the person with the most support actually wins. How the heck is having the loser be the winner a good idea?
I don't think anyone is interested in pursuing its abolition before the next election. That makes 0 sense.
This is an old Republican talking point, but the electoral college isn't doing shit for low-density rural areas.  It's not like the EC is getting a farmer in rural California any attention or that campaigns target sparsely populated portions of Florida when ten times as many voters live in the metro areas.  All the EC does is focus attention on a handful of battleground states while minority party populations across the country get effectively disenfranchised.
Geography doesn‚Äôt vote. Areas cannot be disenfranchised, voters can. Democrats *do* run candidates who address lower density rural area *voters* who have Democratic values, and always have. We shouldn‚Äôt want Democrats candidates trying to appeal to voters whose values don‚Äôt align with the party base or the party platform, regardless of where they live. Democrats also don‚Äôt address high density, urban area voters who don‚Äôt have Democratic values, and they shouldn‚Äôt be chasing their votes either.   I have friends and family in the South and Midwest whose votes for Democratic presidential have never counted, or only counted one time (Clinton‚Äôs re-election whomping of Dole.) The votes of Republicans in California, Illinois and New York have not counted in nearly 40 years. There is no sensible defense of that. One person, one vote is the central organizing hallmark principle of democracy. States and regions do not have voting rights. Individuals have the franchise. It‚Äôs time we start to act like it.
> We're never going to get enough states to adopt the NPVIC for it to go into effect.  I agree it's a tall order, but I don't think it's impossible.  Wisconsin, Minnesota and Pennsylvania gets us to 236.  Michigan, Arizona and Virgina pushes it past 270.  Win the state houses and governor in those six states, and we can do it.  And it doesn't have to be all at the same time.  Several of those states are trending blue.
That, plus the House and President are no longer functioning as the voice of the people they were supposed to thanks to Gerrymandering, the cap on the number of Representatives, and the EC.  If the Senate had less power and the House and Presidency were more democratic, the situation would be fine IMO. The problem is, it doesn't and they don't.
I didn't mean literally why is it that way, I'm saying there's no good reason we should keep it that way.
Unfortunately its very hard to abolish a legislative body without looking like a tyrant. Caesar, Hitler, and Emperor Palpatine have pretty much ruined that move for everyone.
one requires a constitutional amendment, the other requires a rules change
Lmao you say that like abolishing the senate would be easier than abolishing the filibuster.
Better yet, \*reform\* the filibuster. Make it so you need the support of Senators representing at least 60% of the population to call a vote.
That doesn't really respond to the issue. When the Senate was made the largest state had about 10X the population of the smallest. Today the largest has 70X the population of the smallest.  Half of the Senate represents less than 20% of the population. DC doesn't even get Senators and there are more people there than in Vermont or Wyoming.  If the Senate just oversaw issues related to balancing state vs. federal powers you could make the argument that representing each state equally made sense. But since it legislates in exactly the same way as the House (and can constrain the House), it's wildly anti-democratic.  But anyway, "that's how the Constitution was negotiated and written" is a terrible argument. It's not 1787. Originally Senators weren't even elected, they were appointed. So... there's some room for improvement on the original idea!
The two main options that I've seen for expanding the House are  1.  [The Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule), where every single district would have the same number of people per representative as Wyoming (which has the smallest number of people per representative in their at-large district). This would increase the size of the House from 435 to 547. 2. [The Cube Root Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_root_rule), where the number of representatives in the House will be the cube root of the U.S. population. This would increase the size of the House from 345 to 676.  I'm sure there are others, but those are the two main ones that I've heard of, and I think implementing either would be great.
People are deathly afraid of Article V for some reason. I worked with Wolf PAC for years in my state but people are really reluctant to open that can of worms. I think it's a really good idea but not enough people understand or trust it.
That's the whole point...
If it was not for the EC, she would have won.
> There are no disadvantages and advantages for either party if that were the case.  There is a clear disadvantage for the GOP in allowing majority rule, since a majority of Americans favor liberal policies on most issues. This is why Mitch McConnell said recently that improving election security would give an advantage to Democrats. And it's why Republicans are aggressively purging voter rolls based on demographics, rather than  automatically registering everyone.   Republicans know their ideas are doomed in a free society, so they're doing everything they can to avoid that.
I mean that just ensures that the balance between votes allocated per state and per population remains the same. That in of itself doesn't tilt the balance away from big states.  &#x200B;  The bigger issue I see with what you're talking about is that it has made politicians more distant from citizens than they used to be. For example in 1913 when the law came into effect each house member represented about 220,000 people, which is about the size of a medium city. Today each house member represents about 750,000 people, which is about the size of a small metropolis. I would like to actually see our congress expand to see many many more politicians. A good number might be 1 politician per 50,000 people, which is a pretty standard sized city. This would do a lot of things:  1. It would make it harder for corporations to coordinate influence campaigns since they would have to interact with many more people 2. It would make party politics weaker since it would be harder to control a larger body of politicians 3. It would open up more opportunities for citizens to interact with their representatives since the ratio of representative time to citizens would be higher  It's a radical idea because many people would balk at having 6500 congressmen. However, I don't think it's a big deal. Budget wise legislators are very insignificant. For example Massachusetts, in its state government, has 1 house member per 43,000 people, and it manages fine. As far as being harder to whip up a consensus, I think that's a good thing. A bill should pass based on legislators liking the bill, not based on party politics and back room deals. Finally, in terms of making it hard to come up with legislation, that would simply require another process. Even in the current legislature bills are typically written by smaller committees. Something similar would have to happen with an expanded congress. The important part though would be that a bill wouldn't pass unless it would be approved by a majority of the full congress, meaning the committees have to take into consideration broad appeal.
Got it. That makes sense, thank you.

Well, there are various state-level efforts to tie electoral votes to popular votes.  Also the battle over whether electoral votes all go to the winner, are allocated proportionately, or, one might presume they could be awarded by district.  That's a matter of party policies & state election laws - not the Constitution.
To protect the rights of less populated states?
"Madam President, you have a plan for everything. What's your plan in dealing with the Senate?"  "I AM THE SENATE."
I should rephrase. I definitely do not think Warren, or any other President should just send in the troops and just shut the body down. It definitely should be done through Constitutional Amendment.
Then let's get an Amendment going.
Abolishing the Senate would be much more difficult, but I don't see why that is relevant. It is the correct opinion to have so I am going to stick with it.
That sounds like the status quo to me.
**Wyoming Rule**  The Wyoming Rule is a proposal to increase the size of the United States House of Representatives so that the standard representative-to-population ratio would be that of the smallest entitled unit, which is currently Wyoming. Under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, each U.S. state is guaranteed at least one representative. If the disparity between the population of the most and least populous states continues to grow, the disproportionality of the House will continue to increase unless the House (which size has been fixed at 435 since 1913, except for a brief period from 1959 to 1963) is expanded.  A total of 569 House seats would have been required to implement the Wyoming Rule based on the 2000 Census results.  ***  **Cube root rule**  The Cube Root Rule is a proposal to increase the size of the United States House of Representatives so that the standard representative-to-population ratio would be the cube root of the U.S. population as calculated in the most recent census. Under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, each U.S. state is guaranteed at least one representative. If the disparity between the population of the most and least populous states continues to grow, the disproportionality of the House will continue to increase unless the House (which size has been fixed at 435 since 1913, except for a brief period from 1959 to 1963) is expanded.  The Cube Root Rule has been applied to many national legislatures and parliaments since it was first devised by Rein Taagepera, an Estonian political scientist.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
It's because a Constitutional Convention could easily be hijacked by right-wing groups and oligarchs to remove our fundamental rights -- and they're [already mobilizing to do exactly that](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a14841457/convention-of-states-campaign-secession/).
If there was not the EC both candidates would have campaigned completely different.   Hillary tried to win the EC and was unsuccessful.
There‚Äôs been doomed political parties all throughout history.  We shouldn‚Äôt be propping up an unfair system to help one party.  I mean it when I said there no advantages or disadvantages in the popular vote.  Making things equals means taking away advantages, (which the current repubs would lose) and putting them both on equal ground.  But they could do what all creatures on earth do.  Adapt or die. Appeal to larger voter base.
Wait, why would eliminating the electoral college impact federal spending? All appropriations bills originate in the House of Representatives which is the most direct and locally relevant form of representation we‚Äôve got on the federal level. Who wins the presidency has very little impact on how funds are allocated for projects in the various states and districts.
That's not what the Senate does. It's a legislative body. Giving less populated states more control over legislation doesn't "protect their rights" it "advances their interests over the will of the majority." I don't think you can justify unequal representation, and right now the Senate gives a resident of Wyoming 70X the political power of a resident of California. I have the wild idea that every American's vote should count equally regardless of which state they live in.
Abolishing the filibuster in the meantime isn't stupid though! There's no way in hell we're going to have the chance to abolish the senate in the near future, or ever really, so the filibuster should go in the meantime.  Bernie also had a cool idea that involved having the VP tell the senate to fuck off because there's some kinda rule where they can do that but I can't remember if they can only do it when they are in a tiebreak position or exactly what it is called, I'd have to google that again.
Yes, but what comes out of it would have to be ratified by the states so what's the danger? I guess the fear is that there's already too many red states so you might just need a few more to ban abortion nation wide somehow but it's unrealistic in the sense that you organize enough to start a convention but you're somehow not organized enough to prevent something radical and unrelated from coming out of there and being ratified by states?
How would they have campaign different?
3 million votes is not just a simple matter of "campaigning differently".  He was an unpopular candidate and became an unpopular president because of an undemocratic system implemented when the states were much more independent.  Whether or not Clinton lost under the rules at the time is irrelevant to whether a system that promotes minority rule is a good one.
Welcome to America! We don't live in a democracy, this is a Constitutional Republic where the rights of the minority are protected.
>Abolishing the filibuster in the meantime isn't stupid though! There's no way in hell we're going to have the chance to abolish the senate in the near future, or ever really, so the filibuster should go in the meantime.  Fair enough.  >Bernie also had a cool idea that involved having the VP tell the senate to fuck off because there's some kinda rule where they can do that but I can't remember if they can only do it when they are in a tiebreak position or exactly what it is called, I'd have to google that again.  If I remember right, the VP breaks a tie vote in the Senate, but that doesn't matter unless you overcome the filibuster.
Just a few quick things. No more battle ground states to focus on. Trump for instance would have campaigned tons more in Illinois and California.  Tons more nationally aired TV, radio ads. Iowa, Maine, other small states would hardly see the candidates.  I‚Äôm for the EC but really don‚Äôt mind either way. If we do away with the EC it should delayed to give everyone plenty of time to prepare.
Okay, kid.
I know that the democratic governor of Nevada was against the doing away of the EC college, because he was worried that his small state would lose power and influence, when it came to presidental candidates.
Yeah, it's not just the prior election that campaigning would be done differently. No presidential candidate would campaign in a lot of the lower population states for the next 100 years. I think the EC needs to be slightly tweaked so it's more balanced, but it shouldn't be abolished. Otherwise, more rural peoples will be forgotten about on the national level completely.
I know, high school civics can be hard, here is a quote from Benjamin Franklin to hopefully clear it up for you:  >Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.
This argument suggests that the only way a person in Wyoming can learn about a candidate's positions is to have that candidate visit their state.  This is ludicrous.
Well said
Nah, it's more that some kind of weighted system is the only way a candidate would ever care about Wyoming or North Dakota or Montana or a lot of those lower population states.
But the EC wasn't supposed to be about weighting.  It's about the founders not trusting the average person to make an informed choice.
‚ÄúIt's no secret that I'm not a fan of Medicare for All. That's why I'm impressed that Senator Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs‚Å© campaign reached out...Her numbers add up and her plan fully finances the program without imposing any new taxes on middle-class families.‚Äù -- Zandi chief economist, Moody's Analytic
Conversation on this is going on at https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/dvwn9v/economist_warren_is_right_her_medicare_for_all/
Yep, in a lot of ways the corporate pundits and some opponents dared her to tax  the rich more than she had planned because they gave away their dishonest game of "it will raise middle class taxes."   So she went ahead and said, well in that case, I'll keep all the payroll taxes on the employer-side, replacing the amount they already spend on premiums and I'll soak the billionaires while effectively giving most workers who pay some portion of their employer-sponsored insurance a de facto raise.   There was nothing economically or morally wrong with having people pay similar amounts for M4A to what they pay now for employer-sponsored insurance, but Warren used the political attacks as a way to divide and conquer.  **Warren has brilliantly driven a wedge between affluent white-collar workers, like me, and the super-wealthy, by not replacing our small employee share of insurance premiums with a significant payroll tax hike.**  As an example I was expecting that my minimal $25/month portion of my insurance premium (my employer pays 90%+ of the cost on their side) would be replaced with a 4-6% employee payroll tax. It was definitely going to be a big ask from Warren to one of her core constituencies. She found a way not to do it.
It's so disappointing how many economists never actually test their assertions. This one finally does, and what do you know, every other industrialized nation actually is saving money! Who would have thought?
BOOM. Skeptical of her policies? Warren has a plan for THAT too.  While other candidates struggle to create detailed plans and deny they're needed, Warren puts hers out and defends it well. While the armchair professors flail about trying to call her funding plan unviable without raising middle class taxes, she gets the Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics to say its funding does just that.  No yelling. No rabid media attacks. No tweetbook mobs mobilized to harass critics. No shitty nicknames and labels for opponents. Just a quiet campaign to show the numbers and prove the worth of her policies.  THIS is why I'm on the Warren train. She is a legislator who builds coalitions and GETS SHIT DONE.
Do you know what this means? I do! I could tell you... But you'd die!
Math. Can't. Lie.
Medicare for all only seems expensive when you look at paying for everyone with the price gouging rates we pay now. If the gov was the only payer we could set rates so that Pharma companies made just a reasonable profit. And government funded projects would be sold at cost.    Issue is your government has become so corrupt over the past few decades that I see senators changing the rules so that Pharmaceutical companies could still gouge us. We really need to try and revert the corporate hold on our lawmakers or else no real change will ever come about.
Economics is not a science so many economists view policy their ‚Äúworld view‚Äù. Problem is economists rarely admit they‚Äôre wrong and always double down no matter how much real world data disproves their pet theory. Too much ego involved, it‚Äôs why economists keep hoping tariffs will collapse our economy when in reality it hasn‚Äôt come to fruition. They don‚Äôt want to be proven wrong, even though other economies like Japan, and Europe also have protectionist policies that work out pretty well for them.
I saw Warren in person last night and, I swear, SNL nailed it.
Statistics definitely can and does heavily mislead people on a daily basis. However, an endorsement of the soundness of Warren's plan from a economist against M4A is still a great achievement.
To quote my high school algebra teacher:     >Figures don't lie, but liars figure.
Warren pledges to overturn military transgender ban on Day 1
Kind of a no brainer for any dem candidate, but day 1 is also probably going to be the busiest day of the next president's term
My bi heart is warmed by Warren's outspokenness on LGBT issues
Add Day 1 presidency agenda would be a phenomenal debate question.
Tonight. Joy. Virginia and Kentucky. Onward to President Warren
This is great news!
A competent president has all of this stuff ready to go and just needs to sign it.  Chris Christie actually prepared binders of this kind of shit for Trump and it was too much to read so he literally just threw the binders out
At this point, the best way to seperate yourself from the pack is taking the initiative. A month ago Biden had to be asked if he plans to pardon Trump. That's because he never gave the inclination that he would properly handle him when he's out of office. Complacency can't get you anywhere anymore
As a trans woman, same. Like she has no personal stake in LGBT issues but she is very outspoken about them anyway. It really warms my heart.
Have you seen her in the rainbow feather boa?
Yes! No personal stake, and manages to carry it off in a very nonchalant, oh of course this is my stance, of course I'm wearing a rainbow boa, kind of way. She reminds me of coming out stories where grandmas knit their queer grandkid a rainbow sweater, you know? Just wholesome.

66% of ALL Americans approve of Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax ----including 55% of Republicans.
If 55% of Republicans are for it, that means Independents will be wildly in favor of it. Elizabeth is extremely effective at messaging and could easily sell this on a national debate stage.
[It literally does not matter what the people think at all. The rich are buying policy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig)
It‚Äôs not described as *her* plan though. If it was, you‚Äôd expect a significant drop-off in support among Republicans simply because it‚Äôs easy for Fox News/right wing media to mobilize against it. We‚Äôve seen this time and time again on a number of issues.  Then, you have to consider the fact that the uber rich who would be affected by this plan would flood the airwaves/political discourse to try and stop it, which may sow doubt amongst the general public. (It does help, however, that public opinion has overall shifted in favor of taxing the rich.)  This isn‚Äôt to at all downplay the idea of the wealth tax ... it‚Äôs just to show how polling doesn‚Äôt always tell the whole story. It will be a challenge to implement it ... **but this is something that‚Äôs absolutely worth fighting for.**
[deleted]
What amazes me is that 43% of Republicans are not worth 50 million +. In fact, I would wager a good chunk of that 43% are below the poverty line. Yet they are against this. What sort of brain damage do they have? How have the right-wing and 1% convinced so many poor people to help shield the billionaires who literally made their fortune on the backs of those same working class people and do everything they can to keep them poor.
I've found this so many times in my West Texas oil town. If you engage with them on most issues, as long as you avoid the sound-bites and one-liners they've already heard Hannity or Carlson take down on Fox, you find out that *most Republicans* agree with the Democrats on *most issues*. I'm a very well-paid Petroleum Engineer, and my coworkers (ALL of whom are Republican or libertarian except me) even with our top-dollar insurance plan, hate their insurance company. They think the banks pilfered billions in bailouts after leaving millions on the hook for shitty loans. They want to legalize weed and decriminalize hard drugs. Hell, most of them are fine with gay marriage and the Dreamers staying here and having some doors to citizenship (although most of them also want new immigration massively reduced).  Then guns or abortion come up, or they spout some absolutely childish conspiracy theory, and I lose them.

I've seen some people saying the wealth tax would require a constitutional amendment because it's a direct tax - has she explained how she plans to avoid constitutional challenges?
So, if a person has 60 million and decides to keep it sitting in their checking. Every year, the government would take 2% of 10 million. That 10 million will be taxed year after year for just existing.  That does not sit well with me. We already know rich pay virtually zero taxes. If we made rich actually pay taxes for wealth earned we would have plenty of money. And I am not talking reported income because they only report a fraction of they actually make.  When a person makes a huge some of money they made that because their companies used the roads we built and have employees schooled by our education system and so on. So let‚Äôs the country is entitled to a cut of all the profits.  After the country gets their fair cut, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable taxing the same money over and over. The focus should be taxing profits made for the year.
Not under an Elizabeth Warren administration!
Lol true
The truth is *much* more complicated than this 6 minute video lets on.    I highly recommend reading [*Lobbying and Policy Change* by Baumgartner Et al.](https://www.amazon.com/Lobbying-Policy-Change-Wins-Loses/dp/0226039455)  The short and thick of it is that lobbying isn't just a money game.  Entrenched interests beat all but the most massive sums of money backed by the most organized lobbying groups. Even when you can array the money, intellectual capital, and manhours towards an issue you want to change the issue is only *partially reframed* around 5% of the time.  You can ban the money tomorrow and it is unlikely to solve our problems.
A group of foxes is called a "skulk" or "leash".
That's not true, many billionaires are for it too.  Everyone does better when everyone does better.   "20 individuals purporting to be among the top 0.1% in the U.S. in terms of financial net worth called on all candidates for president to support a wealth tax -- even though they'd be among those who'd have to pay it."    https://www.fool.com/taxes/2019/06/29/why-would-billionaires-ever-want-a-wealth-tax.aspx
Taxes = socialism
In fairness, as a former Libertarian Party member, a lot of the ideology of laissez-faire is built on the Randian ideal that rich people get rich because they're the most productive, and by building massive enterprises, they create opportunities for others and deserve the wealth that comes along with the ride. They aren't all just "temporarily embarrassed millionaires" like smug redditors like to say (sure, some are). Most people who support the free market *don't* think they'll be worth hundreds of millions some day, but *do* think it's important to leave that open as an incentive for the people they see as driving the economy forward.  I myself used to firmly believe that after reading Ayn Rand, until I learned a lot more about the dissolute nature of innovation and until I worked at major companies and saw how much of the progress comes from people at the lower levels of income coming up with clever workarounds or new strategies, while the resulting profits are squeezed out by shareholding hedge funds.

Elizabeth Warren is one of few people who know and can explain such things but according to this article, a wealth tax does not violate the constitution.  https://verdict.justia.com/2019/02/07/can-we-tax-wealth-yes-and-even-if-not-still-yes
>So, if a person has 60 million and decides to keep it sitting in their checking. Every year, the government would take 2% of this.  2% of the amount in excess of $50 million, so $200,000 would be paid on that $10 million.
I'm taxed every year on my home and no one is crying for me.
It's a bit of a stretch to think a wealth tax benefits the wealthy.   They probably support it because they're altruistic just like many rich people support higher taxes. Doesn't mean they expect to be better off with the higher taxes, but they have enough money they don't care.
Thanks for pointing that out. I‚Äôll correct the OP. My main point still stands.
$200,000/$60 million is 0.33%. My yearly property taxes currently amount to 1.8% of my net worth.
Your property goes up in value every year while cash loses every year (inflation). Now, if the person invests that money we should tax the profit they make from it.  But I philosophically disagree with taxing money itself. Tax investments, profits, or any increased wealth. That profit was only possible because of the infrastructure built by the blood and sweat of the working class.  And I am a staunch liberal (who has not made up my mind on who I am voting for). Currently posting on the subreddits of many candidates. Slowly warming up to Warren.
For those subject to the wealth tax, very little of their wealth is cash...very little. It would be wasteful to just let cash sit.
>That profit was only possible because of the infrastructure built by the blood and sweat of the working class.  So why not put some of it back into the hands of the working class via taxes?  Edit: Misunderstood what you were getting at here. Although I don't understand the arbitrary line you are drawing between the money itself and the profits made from it.
I agree which is why we should tax the profit they create from that money. Today they pay virtually zero in taxes from the profit they earned (not to be confused with reported income).   If we closed the loopholes then the rich would pay their fair share. No need to tax money itself. Tax investments/profits.
I have repeated many times over I still want to tax the rich. Just that we tax the profits the make (which we don‚Äôt do now due to all the loopholes) instead of taxing the money itself as you end up taxing that same money year after year. Instead of 2%, we do 40% one time on profits. We will end up taking the same back.  If I make 100 bucks, taxed 35 bucks then I will never agree with you taxing that same money (remaining 65 bucks) next year. However, if I make 100 bucks profit (by investing that 65 bucks) then tax me on that 100 bucks. The rich are making huge profits every year.   It is a philosophical thing for me. I don‚Äôt want something being taxed more then once. That goes for someones property tax. Tax the profit, not the original cost used with money already taxed. It is unfair for a retired couple to be taxed every year on the same thing.
>Tax investments/profits.  Is it *investments* or *profits on investments* that you would have us tax? If it's the former, property taxes continue as they are AND we can tax the value of investments above $50 million regardless of profits. If it's the latter, we would have to change the basis of property taxes to current value minus purchase price.
It's because some of the obscenely wealthy are so wealthy they have hundreds of millions of dollars just stashed around that they gift to their kids, and their kids, and so on. It creates a dynasty of generational wealth, people who are born into money and horde it their whole lives. It creates the Trumps of the world. People should not be allowed to simply remove money from our economy and horde it. If they have so much that it is literally just SITTING there, then I am all for the government taking a small amount and putting it to use year after year. Considering all the other loopholes and tax evasion schemes, 2% on values over 50 million is a drop in the bucket, yet could change the lives of our fellow citizens with universal healthcare, debt free college, student loan forgiveness, etc.  Also, no one that wealthy is letting their money just sit. Most have it invested earning 5% or more a year, so this 2% wealth tax still means they will likely continue to grow their generational wealth, just not quite as obscenely.
It should be current value minus purchase price. I never liked that a retired couple is taxed on something they already paid taxes for. And this should be expanded to all investments. Today the wealthy pay virtually zero on their investments (even long after they retire thanks to the many loopholes that exist)  So, instead of taxing money itself we should tax the profits. Profits they were only able to make because of the infrastructure that was built by the working class (roads/schools/police/hospitals/etc)
Fine with me. Adjust the tax rates to effect the same outcome that Warren's plan would achieve and we're good to go.
Canvassed For Warren Today In Ferndale, MI
Thanks for getting out there and making contact with potential voters!
Hell yeah. Also please make sure John James is dealt a stunning defeat next year!
I will be canvassing in Iowa tomorrow :)
Thank you!! Wonderful work!
My repects from Royal Oak, neighbor!
Thanks for volunteering! Volunteers get a special flair too!
Hi. I‚Äôm a political reporter for my radio station. Can you tell me your experience when canvassing for warren, what people reacted to your canvassing, what your thoughts were when doing this as well?
Thank you! Michigan is super super super important in 2020
Thanks for doing your part! I've been considering doing some canvassing, and what always makes me nervous is if I run into someone that disagrees or is rude. Do they give you vocabulary for situations like this? I'm not usually good at dealing with people, but I want to help haha
Thank you!
A fellow Ferndalian!
SO CUTE
The person on the left looks pretty similar to the picture on the left wall. Good genes!
Wow good for you guys! That's awesome!
As a Wolverine fan I support this!
Michigan represent!!!
Doing Gods work.. keep it up
Go green!
Hear hear!
Post a pic!
We‚Äôd love to have you next time!
It was wonderful, I haven't ever canvassed for a candidate and it felt so great to be out and doing something for someone I believe in. I had previously lived in a state where my vote was taken for granted and honestly I took our system for granted a bit myself. These last few years have gotten me moved to the Detroit metro and I have also vowed to get more involved in the process. I went to the barnstorm training yesterday, so I went out today to cement my commitment.
Yeah and we each had a buddy. At this point it‚Äôs not really about pushing anyone to Warren, it‚Äôs about getting good data for future use. So we had a simple script that introduced ourselves, and then asked what issues were important to them. Then asked their top three candidates. If they were excited for EW, we asked if they want to volunteer or whatnot. We also didn‚Äôt stop at every door. Go for it, it‚Äôs really important  but labor-intensive work. It‚Äôs an amazing way to help EW.
How did people in the Michigan area react to warren? She clearly needs this state to win the primary and general.  What drew you to warren and what drew your canvassers to warren
Were people receptive? I canvassed for Abdul in Ferndale in 2018. Such a wonderful progressive city, but I was surprised at the mix of political perspectives from residents farther from the downtown area.
For me, I like her plan and how she‚Äôs organically built to this point, this is the first time she‚Äôs been a frontrunner in the race and she‚Äôs worked to get to this point. She was warmly received in the field, but the biggest thing for everyone was to beat Trump.
Generally yes they were, but like I said we weren‚Äôt really pushing anyone. It was more about info gathering.
Awesome
Ady Barkan: Elizabeth Warren is Right. Time to Admit Medicare for All Saves Americans Money, Tax Hike or Not
Can we just drop that mention of a tax hike? Those comments and conversations are falling into the conservative trap. It's irrelevant to the conversation. Is it a better deal? Can it be stable? Can it be reliable? Let's get to the important questions and the benefits of single payer systems.
the only consistent message the right wing in America has is "lower taxes good, higher taxes bad".  They're like fucking economic cave-men.  So of course they want her to go on national television and say "i will raise your taxes" so they can beat their war drums and summons their people to the Thunder Dome.  She's right to not fall for it.  We pivoted from "global warming" to "climate change" because it made more sense of the conversation.  We have to pivot from "health care tax" to "Health care cost" in the same way.
I'm just glad Elizabeth can admit she didn't have the best answer at the debate for the question about funding Medicaid (or not giving them the soundbite) and she the  worked right after to fix the issue, You're never gonna see that out of Donald Trump! It's one of the biggest things I love about Liz, she can admit fault, fix the issue and work on the problem! People aren't perfect, imagining politicians are perfect isn't realistic.
Now is the time we must hammer away at this. It's annual enrollment time! This is when we find out our "great" insurance, which we love soooo much, the price is going up or to keep the cost low we have to pick a plan with higher deductible and or higher copay. Or move to the plan your doctor is not on or pay more to keep the doctor we love ...   It's that wonderful time of year when your company, who provides you such great insurance that we love so much decides to switch to a different provider.   And my fellow retirees, on medicare maybe with reimbursement for part A, B, C etc. And they think this does not matter to them. Those go up now too.   This is when we have that conversation with people who think they have great insurance, think they always will and show them "plans change, prices go up, coverage goes down. MCFA stabilizes that."   We'll never get a better chance.
M4A. It saves lives of Americans.  I‚Äôm on CHAMPVA. It is the VA dependent Insurance that runs like Medicare. I‚Äôm going in, because they found abnormal cells from my colon.  But,  4 years ago, I couldn‚Äôt have even went to a check up. Maybe this could save my life. Not for me, but my kids and grandkids. They might not need to see me leave their world. We need to take care of Americans. Our tax dollars can change worlds for families and their loved ones.
It is asinine to criticize Warren for not laying out a plan at a debate for what is arguably one of the most complex policy topics to tackle. (Which is what I see her getting a lot of flak for).  What I think is a major concern is that most MFA policies lack a private option. Even my more progressive friends in professional jobs highly doubt that a MFA realignment is the end all and be all of the healthcare debate. I could be wrong, I haven't seen the latest plan Warren has laid out (I think she just recently announced one coming or has put one out?) and maybe it doesn't exclude private coverage?
I know Liz likes the whole 2 cent tax... But c'mon Liz, why not 3 cents? Or even more?
Honest question, my conservative told me once a program switches from private to public, the quality drops since there is less incentive to stet competitive.  What‚Äôs a good response to this ?

i'm not going to going to argue m4a or not. i will point out ady is not necessarily accurate in the reason that single payer is why japanese long term healthcare is cheap (their structure is not really "single payer" as we think it). It's heavily regulated, that's why many of the medical care is cheaper in Japan than US. And japan has government provided insurance but also employer provided insurance and private insurnace.  (employer insurance is regulated and max at I think about 11% of your previous years income.)  https://www.realestate-tokyo.com/living-in-tokyo/japan-medical/health-insurance  https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.19.3.26

She was so awkward on the debate stage, trying to defend Medicare for All, probably because it isn‚Äôt her bill. Bernie answered the very same question moments later in a way that was honest and easy to understand.  She stumbled because, if we‚Äôre being honest, she‚Äôs trying to have it both ways. She wants to placate the left while also not scaring those on the right with the idea that ‚Äî gasp! ‚Äî taxes will go up.  She‚Äôs does Medicare for All a huge disservice when she does this. She needs to stop triangulating and start being brutally honest (in the manner of Sanders).
Yeah, there are plenty of real policy-based questions that can be asked about it and they focus on the one that's a completely worthless conservative talking point.
It's sad that everyone and their mother is intent on getting that soundbyte every time instead of focusing on these points. Props to Liz for not playing their game.
maybe im biased, but i'm getting annoyed with fellow democrats providing the gop with ammunition for the general
I think the other way around. Embrace the term tax hike. Take the word back. Being afraid to say it means you think something is bad about raising taxes for universal healthcare.  When a person says tax hike respond hell yah a tax hike so people don‚Äôt go bankrupt because of medical bills.
brilliant point.
I think it'd just be great to tell people, yes your taxes may go up, but you'll never pay a doctor's bill again! And you'll get everything (within reason) covered! I think people can understand a higher tax will mean more services. I'm really excited about getting costs down in America! How is it that the "cure" (a series of pills taken over a period of time) to Hepatitis C costs $4,000 in India, but costs $20,000 in America? It's the same pill! I think upfront costs will be high with M4A, but once costs like that are actually pushed down for once, it will become cheaper overall than ACA. We have to start getting these medical costs under control there is absolutely no reason besides greed.
Buttigieg really tried to nail her on it, and the rest will too. So it was definitely smart to jump on releasing her plan.
What she do to address the issue afterwards? One of my colleagues brought up the her debate response today and I didn‚Äôt have a good response for him except to point out what she was trying to say. Need help addressing the concern
I hope everything works out for you! But having care after not having it is like night and day! I'm glad I live in IL where they expanded Medicaid, I can't imagine a state leaving that ACA money on the table... How can those states tell their constituents that they had $$$ to help them but won't because of politics and still be re-elected?
What do you get from a private option that you wouldn't get from m4a? I have employer insurance and it's balls. It would still be a huge financial hit to get sick.
We allow a private option -> Insurance companies use manipulative marketing techniques to sell Americans an inferior option -> These Americans spend 40 years paying into private insurance and not M4A -> They get cancer or some other terminal illness -> Insurance company refuses to cover cost adequately or just drops them entirely -> M4A (which they have never paid into) foots the entire bill -> The insurance companies repeat this process hundreds of thousands of times causing M4A to run out of money needed to cover participants -> All the while the insurance companies you‚Äôve allowed to continue existing are lobbying and bribing government to weaken M4A -> M4A is declared a failure and forever paraded around as an example of why we should never try that again because private insurance is so much better.  Either we end the insurance companies entirely or M4A eventually is torn down by them.
The private option gives large hospital groups the opportunity to all "independently and without collusion" decide to refuse to take the expanded Medicare.  One of the problems we had in MA for a long while with Masshealth is that people on Masshealth couldn't go anywhere decent because doctors would refuse to take Masshealth's reasonable (lower) non-negotiable rates.  Enough doctors *would* take Masshealth that they didn't just raise their acceptable rates, but they were patient-factories, churning as fast as they could get away with, with much lower-quality care.  That insurers can still negotiate with doctors means doctors pick an absurd base rate, and insurers need only pay more than M4A is willing, and the doctors can be bought out of the public availability market.  As long as private insurers exist, there is no way to tell doctors they will *only* get $250 for an x-ray, if they can charge $350 to insurers or $1000 for cash-pay.  Public option is a band-aid, but it has all the negatives the ACA has, where it doesn't *stop* the growth of the medical-profit-cancer, or reduce the amount of money that goes into the industry that is spent on reasons other than direct healthcare.  Further, nobody is incentivized to make Medicare decent because the wealthy just get the private insurance anyway.
Her recent news is only about prepping more detail on financing single-payer.
On the subject of private insurance, I don't think there would be anything wrong with allowing *additional* insurance. But the key word is *aditional*. This is already the case for alternate or experimental procedures in Bernie's M4A bill but for other stuff it would have to be legislated in a way that ensures private insurance companies/customers pay more into the system/hospitals than they take out on average.  The problem is when you have medicare as merely an opt in system and allow private alternatives this essentially breaks how M4A works as you'll probably end up with the public option being filled with the poorest and sickest among us which would result in awful quality healthcare.   I think Warren could disarm the whole 'banning private insurance' thing if she just said that additional insurance is something we could easily work towards later down the line, but let's just fix the fundamental problems first. Or she could try and come up with a plan but it would be a lot of extra work for something that would have little effect and basically just exist to placate those who have ideological objections to getting rid of private insurance.
Cuba has world class doctors and services and it's a public system, it's all in how it's administrated.
Removed for trolling. There are a million other subs you can "but Bernie". Go to one of those.
Removed for trolling. You know full well both Ady and Warren are committed to M4A. People latching on to the "framework" talking point never actually listened to the question.
I don't think it's "providing them ammunition."  It's pointing out the ammunition that they're going to use regardless of whether we brush it off during the primary.
See also: ‚Äúdemocratic socialists‚Äù. Bernie Sanders and those who generally agree with him on domestic policy are not any kind of socialists; the term they‚Äôre looking for is social democrat.
It doesn't work that way unfortunately. The conservatives push its use because it's a complicated word that's contentious.
The sound byte won't be "it's worth more taxes to get you universal healthcare"... It will be (with epic commercial voice):  > NARRATOR: ELIZABETH WARREN WANTS TO TAX YOU TO DEATH   > Warren: "yes, there will be taxes ... it's going to be about $5000 a year per household"   > NARRATOR: DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER $5000 TO FEED TO THE SWAMP?   >Warren: "yes, there will be taxes .... yes, there will be taxes.  yes, there will be taxes"
She said she'll put out a funding plan. The response is, taxes will go up, but premiums will be reduced to 0, so that people save money overall because insurers are being killed so all the money they suck from people will no longer be sucked.  Effectively, you'll pay $0.00 to insurers and instead pay a income-based premium to government that's lower than your current premium.
I want to know too. Did she finally mention raising taxes?
I live in NY that has great coverage. Thank you for your well wishes. I think I‚Äôll be fine, from the tests that I couldn‚Äôt do before.  I get concerned on the red states that say healthcare is not covered. It‚Äôs just wrong. These are children,parents, and their loved ones. Everyone deserves the right to healthcare in the richest country. I‚Äôm so sick of the Gofundme. No. I will pay taxes to pay for it.
The private option, or medicare for all who want it (M4AWWI), is more of an in-between point between the current system and medicare for all. Either way you would be able to get medicare.  The thinking is that M4AWWI is easier and quicker to achieve, and can serve as a 'glide path' towards some form of universal health care, be that M4A or something else. So both really want to do the same thing, but just in different ways, and M4AWWI is seen as either less ambitious or more practical, depending on what camp you are in.  One thing to consider is that M4AWWI has broader support. For example, back in July 2019, [this poll](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1907190926.pdf) (page 15) showed that 70% of respondents thought M4AWWI was a good idea, versus only 41% for M4A. The majority of people interviewed, 54%, thought M4A was a bad idea. Maybe that has since changed, but I doubt the needle has moved a whole lot since then.  For a good write-up on M4A vs M4AWWI, see [here](https://medium.com/@polarea/a-deep-dive-into-health-the-buttigieg-plan-vs-the-sanders-warren-plan-ca073df68dc0).
Thanks for the clarification.
I was banned from the Bernie sub for posting pro warren stuff lol
>framework  Not only that, I strongly recommend reading [Dylan's pos](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/djidky/im_the_young_man_with_ms_elizabeth_talked_about/f48nk93?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)t on the "framework" comment. He was the MS patient at that townhall, and was frustrated that Warren's comment was taken so out of context and used to bash her, because he was concerned patients like him are left out of the current M4A bill's transition period. That's what the "framework" comment was really about. But outrage goes viral; facts do not.
The sound byte is more than "She intends to tax you for Medicare for All".  If she straight up says that the middle class will be taxes more, that will be used in conservative ads outside of any context.  They will spin it to make it look *more* expensive by thousands of dollars than what they currently have, and will use her voice to say it
Can you articulate to me exactly what the difference between those two things is? Seems to me like you're just changing which is the noun and which is the adjective. The difference seems entirely semantic to me and I don't understand what purpose it serves.
[DSA has apparently changed their mind about Bernie](https://www.dsausa.org/bernie-2020-dsa-endorsement-debate-process/).  They used to criticize him, but have since come to believe he's the best way they can wedge in.  If you're endorsed by our biggest "Democratic Socialist" organization, maybe you can get by starting to call yourself that.
>See also: ‚Äúdemocratic socialists‚Äù. Bernie Sanders and those who generally agree with him on domestic policy are not any kind of socialists; the term they‚Äôre looking for is social democrat.  I will point out that Bernie says he is not a capitalist, so you can try to play the whole "democratic socialists are actually capitalist social democrats" but I think he himself would reject that label.
They already do that, just follow conservative subreddit or Fox News. Anytime you have to explain why something is good you lose. Admit it as fact and move on. Keep on the offensive. By not saying it will increase taxes (which is the truth) people (even a moderate like CNN) will continue to challenge. Fox does not matter because they will do it regardless.
That sounds pretty similar to what the other candidates said at the debate.
She did. She laid out her plan for Medicaid for All and included a tax increase that would still save people money because they'd spend less on Premiums than they'd spend on higher Taxes. I think her refusal to lay it all out on the debate stage was due to the fact that she couldn't elaborate and that she didn't want to give them the soundbite that would be used against her next year during the election.
Yea it's ridiculous, we hosted a Thai student through AFS and he couldn't understand that about America. Even in Thailand they have a single payer system and it keeps costs down! He's even a doctor in Thailand, he had to work for 2 years in Bangkok General before he could practice, so he understands medicine quite well, but he doesn't understand how America can be so backwards. In all industrial countries besides the US it's covered how can we be a super power and not cover our people?
The thing is, the point of the Warren sub is to promote Warren and the point of the Bernie subs is to support Bernie.  I am all for defending Bernie, even here, when he has unwarranted attacks levied against him. But I don't try and push Bernie instead of Warren in this sub.  Similarly, I don't go to Bernie's subs and they and convert them to Warren. The point of these subs is not to be the battle ground for poaching.
I dunno--I think they're going to figure out a way to do that anyway.  This is what people mean when they say that the primary is for vetting the candidates and their arguments.  I love Warren to death and have since I was 16 and watched a video of her eviscerating a bunch of bankers on The Daily Show.  I think it's a good and fair thing to bring up these points about the societal perceptions of Medicare for All as a universal healthcare program run by the government and funded by taxes.  That's what it is.  If that idea isn't going to take off for a decently wide majority of the country, I'm of the opinion that we should do what we can on healthcare and spend the leftover political energy from not having to push through a relatively unpopular idea on some of the ten million other immediate problems we need to solve.
M4A is Welfare-state SocDem stuff.  So is more rent controls, expanded safety nets, and even requiring public companies to put worker-representatives on the board.    Socialism is the government (or community, as it were) seizing the means of production.  Traditionally the DSA criticized Bernie.  [Here's a long article from this January speaking out against his run from a Socialist perspective.](https://www.leftvoice.org/A-Socialist-Case-Against-Bernie-2020)  Per the Atlantic.  [Bernie is not technically Socialist, just like America isn't technically Capitalist.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism/471630/)  Words have meaning, and people are trying to use them to be more, or less, edgy in attempt to win the election.  That is all.  I support a lot of what Bernie is pushing, even though I no longer identify as a socialist myself... because it's not really socialism.
Yeah, but if that commercial ends with "This ad was paid for by Biden For President", that fact will make it much more effective if/when Warren wins the Primary and ends up in the general.
Not really. It's what Bernie said, but Buttigieg, Biden, and Klobchar are just being disingenuous about taxes, as if $1 in taxes is like doubly worse than $1 in premiums.  The fact is cost for people WILL BE HIGHER under a M4A If You Want It plan than under M4A. Their plans are more costly for people.
Maybe her competition would get the soundbite, but as someone who was hoping for her to get the nomination, it seemed disingenuous and weak, especially compared to Bernie, who was able to explain that concept briefly, clearly, and repeatedly.    Bernie‚Äôs now in my top spot because of that and because Warren downplayed concerns about automation effecting unemployment.
Insurance corporations own healthcare. Simple. I think it started in the late 60‚Äôs.
I‚Äôm not trying to convert anyone. In fact I‚Äôm trying to promote positivity between the two groups because while I‚Äôd like sanders to win, I believe warren is more electable.   I‚Äôm encouraging warren fans to be aware that sanders supports similar things and I‚Äôm encouraging sanders fans to consider that warren is adopting his policies.  Because I want a Democrat to win in 2020  What I said is factual and based on this explanation is 100% not trolling
The problem is this. EVERYONE already knows the answer to the questions she's being asked.  They just don't like HOW she's giving that answer.  Why is that?  Why is it such a big deal that she announce that the sky is blue in a way that's going to favor all of her opponents?  They're not *accusing* her of funding it by taxes in a way where she can respond that the taxes are less than the savings.  Instead, they're trying to get the sound bite out of her, to get her to admit to something obvious that should be harmless.    And somehow, it's not hurting her polling to reject that corrupt line of questioning.  So more power to her, IMO.  Single-Payer is awesome enough to resist bullshit attacks in the General, so I see no reason that bugging her about it is going to improve anything for anyone.  It's just the dirtier parts of our party playing dirty and (as far as I can tell) failing.
I do not understand why Warren would be better than Bernie if their plans are the same. Bernie was a total alpha and acknowledged that taxes would go up. It's harder for me to connect to a beta who avoids answering questions. I guess that's just me.
There is 0% chance that anyone on this sub doesn't know that Bernie has been an early major advocate for M4A and your comment had nothing to say beyond "but Bernie did it first".  You're absolutely not going to be engendering positivity by adding "but Bernie" to posts about Warren.  Whether you meant it or not, your comment was basically indistinguishable from trolling.  Edit: What ZerexTheCool said.
I love both Warren and Sanders, but we can't let this get contentious like the two dem bases got in 2016.   I cannot believe you're facing so much hostility over simply setting the record straight. It's misleading to pretend that *now* it's "time to admit..." since one candidate is doing the "admitting," while ignoring the fact that another candidate has been transparent about this all along.   "Admit" is also an odd way to say "being transparent about." Stop being afraid of a soundbite. Have courage and stand behind the policies you support!
I think it was too short. Your intent is totally fine, but when reading your comment by itself, it does not sound like what you are describing. It sounds like trolling.  I bet you could have gotten that message across you had just said more than the one sentence. And I would bet it would not have been removed had it been longer.
0% chance? I wish that were true
In this sub, I can pretty much guarantee we all know Bernie has advocated for Medicare for All. Many of us were Bernie voters last time.
I think pretty much 80 percent of Warren supporters also like Sanders and know his stance on the issues. I voted for him in the 2016 primary and I‚Äôm sure many others did here as well.
Why not vote for him this time then?
Because I prefer Warren, I actually wanted her to run in 2016, and I think she is more electable.
Video ‚Üí "Who is going to be your Mike Pence? Who is going to look at you with adoring eyes?"; Warren: "I already have a dog."
That right there is how you beat Trump.  He thrives on rage because anger legitimizes him, whereas humour takes away his power.  Which is also to say - Trump is a boggart.
Warren/Bailey 2020
She and Amy are so quick-witted. I think both of them would dismantle Trump on a debate stage
This is why I think the notion that Trump would drag her in the general is stupid. Trump couldn‚Äôt outwit a brick.
This is why I don't trust any president without a dog because then some other dirty politician steps in to play the dog.
Mike Pence has eyes?
She instantly starts sipping water because the burn is so hot. Absolutely world class.
Haha nice setup from the person asking the question and then Liz slammed it home
I just want to say that I love how much her dog is part of her campaigning.
I love these candid moments. She's so good.
Ok this is the kind of viral moment that we need right now!
ngl i donated to her today just because of this response
Everyone seems to have forgotten how savage she was to Trump during the 2016 election.  It made a lot of folks ask why didn't she run.
I got to enjoy this twice- once upon reading/watching it, and again, upon relaying it to my wife, and watching her practically fall off the couch laughing :D  \#alreadyhaveadog
How many feel like this was a plant?  lots of friends seem to think so.
Now he is wearing Neville‚Äôs Granny‚Äôs clothes in my mind.
I definitely would not mind an uptick in this sub's HP references.  On another thread I mentioned that Bernie is Harry, Warren is Hermione, and Yang is Ron.   Obviously, I'm Hermione over everyone.
Trump is [Ludo Bagman](https://harry-potter.fandom.com/wiki/Ludovic_Bagman).  Not the sharpest fellow, accused of feeding intel to Voldemort, but found to be too stupid to know he was doing it.  No longer the athlete he once was, poor history with creditors, etc.
Well Amy has the advantage of practicing on staff
Also, having been a special needs teacher, Warren is especially qualified to deal with Trump.
[removed]
He couldn't outwit Hillary either. It's not about intelligence. He just spews shit at you. Completely made up shit and some of it accidentily sounds catchy and it sticks. He is not hurt by being fact-checked. He has been proven to be factually incorrect literally tens of thousands of times. Fact-checks are not even being reported anymore. Truth is irrelevant. You need to win a narrative. *That* he cannot damage.
It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúoutwitting‚Äù. Trump rejects the norms and bounds of what we‚Äôve traditionally considered campaigning or debating.  Imagine a student who rips up the exam sheet and throws it in the teacher‚Äôs face to the cheers and applause of an audience. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúoutwit‚Äù or ‚Äúoutwork‚Äù that guy by quietly acing the test.
"WRONG!!! LIAR!!! FAKE NEWS!!! Trump is a STABLE GENIUS and now's the best words. Warren would get crushed biggly in a debate. #KAG2020 /s. Yeah Trump would get destroyed in a debate with Warren. She was a lawyer and law school professor.
He has eyes. Whether there's any emotion behind them is up for debate.
That pan‚Äôs labyrinth monster had eyes. Lol
*sockets
100% real human Tedcruz Forpresident has perfectly working visualization orbs in his face.  [Reference for anyone who hasn't seen this masterpiece yet.](https://www.tedcruzforhumanpresident.com/)
Bailey would be a more respected Veep than Pence.
Anyone who's ever actually been to a Warren town hall knows that plants are impossible. How they work is that anyone who wants to ask a question can get a ticket when they walk in. Then people pull a few numbers out of a bowl. It is random.     However, given the phrasing of the question, the joke writes itself. That, and Elizabeth really does have a good sense of humor- her memoir "A Fighting Chance" actually has a lot of parts that are pretty funny.
I like your choices but I feel like there has never been a more exact Hermione than Warren. It's pretty amazing.
Omg you're right, Bernie IS Harry. Lol
Hermione could have wrapped that whole story up in five books.
It's a miracle that people forgot about that article so quickly.
Savage
*violently whips stapler at your head while screaming klobmentum*
LOL
You say that like it is a bad thing.   Trump needs to have a stapler thrown at him for his BS.
Hahaha
Although her actions in those reports aren't a good look.  I'm always hesitant to latch onto them because if a man were described to being what she did, it could be easily spun and accepted by people as a sign of leadership because it's such a show of passion.  But with a woman, it goes straight to a lot of people's minds as "she's too emotional and can't keep herself together."
Removed. Please do not post conspiracies on this sub.
I still think one of the worst moves is that Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt really counter him everytime he lied in a debate. She would say to go to her website and there were people explaining all his lies in real time.   Which, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs extremely hard to be able to do that when he‚Äôs someone who lies about everything but it would‚Äôve helped shut him down if she engaged at all instead of repeatedly punting to the website that 99% of people didn‚Äôt check.   I really wish warren would pick up steam and be able to actually engage him directly when he starts lying at a debate. Cause people say it wouldn‚Äôt work to point out his lies on the spot but *no one* ever actually tried it!   Only a few journalists have countered him repeatedly and he turns into a huge baby. Imagine if Warren (or Clinton in 2016) would‚Äôve done that to him 5 minutes into a multi-hour debate!?
That's Mitch McConnell to you.
FYI, Hermione eventually becomes Minister of Magic, which is the equivalent of President in wizarding world.
Exactly. More people need to realize that she's who we need. If an issue arises, Warren will be the one talking/negotiating with everyone during the day and studying all night as everyone sleeps to cover every angle of the problem.  Which now makes me wonder. Should we start canvassing in the Harry Potter sub?
He charged in head first into the fight(rightfully so). But Warren was right there with him already having studied the strengths and weaknesses of what they are up against, including contingency plans!
It's usually best practice to not cross a woman who has the resolve to risk altering her own parents memories.
What article?
It's Klobbering time!
I mean I'll fight it either way, but what man is doing this? Let's spread the word when we find one
> if a man were described to being what she did, it could be easily spun and accepted by people as a sign of leadership because it's such a show of passion.  Throwing things at people and screaming at them will get men called assholes too. Steve Jobs, who lots of people like and admire, is widely regarded as an asshole even by Apple fanatics. Most people just don't say anything about it because he gets results and if you're not the one working for him it's no skin off your back. Which is also mostly how I'd feel about Klobuchar if not for the fact that she's going to be staffing the Department of Labor.
Seeing this distinguished makes me love this sub. Thank you.
Countering someone that excellent at bullshitting is extraordinarily tough. A great recent example of this is Bannon on Maher last weekend.  Maher‚Äôs a very smart dude who is pretty quick, but couldn‚Äôt really hold Bannon to task they way he clearly set out to do.
> I still think one of the worst moves is that Hillary Clinton didn‚Äôt really counter him everytime he lied in a debate.   When he lies dozens of times in a single debate, you can't possibly counter all of it. This is a known technique called [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) where you just overwhelm your opponent with so many arguments they can't possibly have time to respond to.
Oh do I. I'm not a big drinker, but if we are able to get Warren to where we all want her to be.. There isn't enough butterbeer in this world or the wizarding one that'll satiate my celebration.
Please be careful about introducing politics to other subs. Not only do we need to avoid brigading (for a great many reasons), we also need to respect where individuals and groups are explicitly trying to avoid certain topics.   If you do feel the spirit and believe it might be in-tune with any given sub, I'd still make sure to speak with a sub's moderation team about it first.
"We wouldn't last two days without her."

Klobuchar no!   #KLOBUCHAR YES!
I agree. If a man did the same thing that Amy is accused of, they'd receive the same label. My issue is that the label doesn't stick on men for as long as it does on women. Especially in media/politics, I believe.  &nbsp;  Like what you said, with Jobs it's accepted that he's an asshole, but a lot of people put it aside because of his contributions to tech/everyday life. However, with Klobuchar and seemingly women in general, the label is given without a follow up thought like, "well she did get this done in the Senate.." or another notable accomplishment.  &nbsp;  These are just my opinion, I'm not trying to say you or anyone is wrong. I just prefer not to add to an echo chamber that might magnify and validate a conversation that is set up to make women look bad by tapping into a conditioned bias that some may have.  &nbsp;  Berating and verbally abusing staff is bad, but in my opinion a distraction from actually talking about policy when it comes to Trump and his supporters/republican voters. It will just be red meat for them to spread and throw around the internet to clog up space/distract others without care for the hypocrisy regarding the president they are defending.
It's the bullshit asymmetry principle--The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.  It's a fundamental part of the Gish gallop technique. If you overwhelm with opposition with enough lies, it becomes impossible to address them all.
True it‚Äôs not easy but I‚Äôd study those times he gets mad and disengages from reporters and walks off or gets really mad. Trump isn‚Äôt as...well I don‚Äôt wanna say smart but he‚Äôs not as efficient as bannon. And he‚Äôs really prone to being gotten to.   Which would happen at every debate if the moderators would just do their jobs...
Ah that's true. Thanks for the reminder!
Yikes
I agree that women are subjected to an unfair double standard. I just wish we didn‚Äôt use this as an excuse to lower the bar for women instead of raising the bar for men. The real problem is that this behavior was always out of line and we‚Äôve been letting jerks get away with it.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with saying Bannon is smarter than Twitler; Bannon is far from a stupid man, even if how those wits are directed is abhorrent. Twitler is cunning, Bannon is clever; neither are wise.
Haha, twitler...
Is this happening? Is it really happening??
I suggest you focus your energy elsewhere.   But yes, it looks more and more like it‚Äôs happening. But shhhhh! ü§´
I was talking to my dad a few days ago, who doesn't necessarily like any of the candidates, and he made the offhand comment that Warren was the likely nominee. It's super uplifting to me that outsiders are starting to see her as such. Even though she may not be first in the polls right now, it's becoming clear that Biden does not have a strong hold over his lead and is not going to last as a frontrunner.
Happening level: it‚Äôs
Absolutely none of this will happen if you don't knock, call, donate, and VOTE
Yes..Yes it is
Happy for Warren but I'm really sad to see Bernie dipping truly. He doesn't usually get the coverage he deserves if you're excluding the politics subreddit which are usually all over him. I feel awful for him and his campaign that health issues had to come up right now of all times.
OMG!!!!!! This is the first political campaign that I have ever contributed to.  I am on FIRE üî• for Senator Warren!!!
Oh yeah. It's all coming together.
In three of the last four polls on RCP, she's leading (but the one where she isn't is the least close, so that's why the average still has Biden *slightly* up).  Still, wow.  Also, I really hope their are an odd number of people in the November debate, bc it's looking increasingly likely she could take center stage in that case.
She has a plan to win the election. Her plans tend to work.
As someone who has admired Liz since she created the CFPB and has had her in my top 3 for the entire campaign I'm in awe with her methodical rise. Nothing fancy. No big blips. Just a steady march upward. Bravo to her and her staff
And on the Economist's tracker she's within 2 points now, up from a 4-point gap last month.   https://projects.economist.com/democratic-primaries-2020/
It's like she has a plan or something
> Sanders, whose nomination prospects could suffer after his heart attack last week, saw support fall after registering 12% the prior two months. Sanders has said he expects to participate in the Oct. 15 debate.   While I am glad that at the prospect of either a Sanders or Warren nomination, I think its important to point out that one of the polls heavily weighing Bernie's dip here is IBD, which had him 4-8% lower than all other national polls in the same time period.  There's no question that Warren is the frontrunner when it comes to traditional polling but I think its premature to say that a large number of his supporters are shifting to Warren.
She's the only one who's rising!
Um... I'm color blind, so that is really, really hard for me to read. Can somebody put it into words (just the gist is good).
You better believe it!!!
Time to fight even harder to help Warren wo the nomination and beat Trump!!
See how much those curves wiggle? A crossover doesn't mean much, by itself. Keep fighting.
Never had a doubt.
finally I picked the right one. Ron Paul in 2012, Bernie in 2016, and this time I wizened up.
Looks like more than a few Bernie supporters jumping over to Warren camp. Warren definitely the most aligned to Bernie‚Äôs positions.
Remember how Hillary polled. All that matters is we get out and vote.
For some reason my mind immediately went to the [The Creation of Adam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/%27Adam%27s_Creation_Sistine_Chapel_ceiling%27_by_Michelangelo_JBU33cut.jpg/600px-%27Adam%27s_Creation_Sistine_Chapel_ceiling%27_by_Michelangelo_JBU33cut.jpg).
RCP really the polling aggregator you wanna cite?  Good news on the traction but a lot of ground still to cover - time to work on continuing to build the momentum and not celebrate an early lead
I guess this explains all the propoganda I've heard against her in the past week or so. Now they're saying she lied about being a teacher (because she was one only for a year, not including her being a professor), and that she lied about being fired for being pregnant (because she wasn't explicit about it in a previous interview).
As a die hard Sanders supporter this does break my heart , but Warren is my strong second pick so it‚Äôs still a win
I‚Äôm gonna predict Biden taking most of the South and Warren taking most of the North. She‚Äôll have the presidency easy if she gets AA‚Äôs in the South.
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   Caucus: February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
Warren has definitely been gaining momentum, but today's Morning Consult Poll on [RCP](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/democratic_nomination_polls/) shows biden +12.   Not to take the wind out of anyone's sails, but until some of the lower tier candidates/Bernie drop out don't expect her to break away from the pack. There's only 100% to the pie and Biden, Bernie, Harris, and Buttigieg have core supporters that aren't going to switch teams easily.    A lot can happen before the Iowa caucus on February 3rd. I'd expect the December/January qualifying criteria for the debates to peel off anyone polling bellow 5% nationally which will narrow the field. However, if Biden were to team up with Buttigieg or Harris and Bernie/Warren don't combine then it'll be hard to overcome on super Tuesday. Like I said a lot could happen.   I'd like to see Warren and Bernie team up and this whole contest would be moot, but we'll just have to wait it out.
Does anyone know what happens to the debate order now? I guess it was already locked in?
Yeah. I have absolutely no idea how to do that.  But thank you!! I‚Äôm perfectly happy with being an anonymous donor.  She‚Äôs  worth every penny!
nope lol

That's cool and all, but honestly polls mean jack squat anymore. I know you're crushing it in Iowa. You have been a super star!
Hiya! Small time youtuber who covers politics, what do y'all want me to play as the victory music after she passes him?
Indeed. The Morning Consult poll will be out later, where Biden consistently scores >30% and Warren barely breaks 20%.  The IBD poll was very promising, but that gap might open back up before the end of the day. Here's to hoping that she nails the MC poll, but let's not assume our work is done.
Focus your energy by volunteering for her campaign! Every little bit helps
For what it's worth, I think Warren's success owes an awful lot to Bernie. He fundamentally changed the conversation in the last election, and, for many people, now serves as a more leftward candidate to compare Biden and Warren to... this makes many centrists perceive Warren as a moderate choice which will appeal to them. That being said, I've seen several of my more moderate friends raise concerns about some of her positions, such as the wealth tax, so there's a lot of work to be done.
Better these issues come up now than once he's the nominee, right?  I love and respect Sen. Sanders. He will always be a strong voice for the 99%. He energized a lot of people and helped reduce apathy.  He has earned a place in history, and he has affected the consciousness of the nation.
What's interesting is that the news about Bernie's heart attack came out on October 2nd, and if you look at the dates of the polls being averaged here, only the very latest one even has any data from poll respondents on the 2nd and 3rd. It looks as if this drop in the polls was \*already\* happening prior to the heart attack.
I feel absolutely the same way.
1-2 months of Warren being higher than Biden and 1-2 dem candidates withdrawing will definitely change the landscape.    Biden is like when your mom told you to eat Brocolli.    Elizabeth Warren is when your mom put butter + cheese + crackers on your broccoli!
it's still early & if you just look at his line -- he's been in a consistent range the entirety of the polling average. I feel like his base is just staying consistent & warren is taking all of the on the fence/undecided voters.

[The Economist's version of her polling line](https://projects.economist.com/democratic-primaries-2020/) is a thing of beauty.
Her messaging is masterful.
That's certainly not what I'm trying to say in posting this. Just that she is almost ahead of Biden, which is exciting.
More of Warren‚Äôs support comes at Harris‚Äô expense.
It is certainly early to say that Bernie is losing supporters - he's still hovering around his average.  What is clear from the averages is that Warren is the only one gaining support since July.
Warren has risen up to near the exact level of Biden in terms of the average poll percentage and is seemingly about to surpass him becoming the front-runner.
Lol I feel you brother!
I saw that. The guy who authored the article has a pretty clear axe to grind. As much as I dislike the attacks, they will make her stronger in the end and will let us know how to argue against this kinda stuff.
On the bright side, for those who were worried that Warren and Sanders would split the progressive vote and Biden would win, it looks like she might just be able to overtake Biden anyway.
Please. She's worked her ass off for this. This isn't hype.

Just a quick browse for polls that start after September 20th (when Trump and the the Right-Wing Media-Industrial Complex made whataboutism pivots to Biden their main strategy) is are showing 4 & 6 point dips.      If this trend continues I imagine this will be why. This is why it's important to have a candidate with favorable that are already pretty high because once      The Right-Wing Media-Industrial Complex starts pumping nightmare fuel 24/7 the nominee is going to take a hit.
Fucking Morning Consult, I swear to God. HarrisX too.
It's so odd for me to understand Democrats who oppose tax increases on the top bracket.  Unions and the working class used to be the defining base of the party.  I mean, it's great that reasonable Republicans are fleeing their tent, but what voice would the middle & poor class have if they totally take over the DNC?
True. If Bernie does end up dropping out, there‚Äôs a possibility she becomes the new Bernie.
I hope Warren appoints him to the white house if she's elected
It really started back on Sept 16th. At that point, she passed him and has shot up since. However, he remained pretty steady until Oct 1st, and has dropped to pretty much his lowest support since then.
I'm also slightly worried that we're getting a Buttigieg effect on Warren's campaign where she's doing so great in polling solely because of the high amount of good media surrounding her and once it dies down she'll begin to drop steeply.
Oh I understand that.. I just see people making false assumptions based on this graph. Not trying to steal her thunder by any means :)
Thanks, and that's good to hear. I'll admit I'm in the tank for Bernie, but Warren is my #2 while Biden is my #... I don't even know. I just want him to drop out before he loses to Trump in the general...
We can‚Äôt assume things will necessarily fall that way of course - it will take work and persistent standing up against bad faith narratives to make it happen. Unfortunately we‚Äôve seen quite a few examples in politics of situations  where ‚Äòquestions‚Äô are invented from nothing, and especially if you made the mistake of being born a woman, just the existence of those questions will be enough for some people to decide you‚Äôre guilty.
Thanks haha
Good point. I didn't notice that the new MC poll will just replace the old one and not change much.   But, you get my point. One bad poll (HarrisX garbage or Fox News), and the gap will open back up. It's definitely not a done deal yet, and we have to keep working on spreading her message.  But, man, if she beats him in the next MC poll, it's going to feel good.

To be fair, the concern among my friends is not increase in taxation on income, but rather a taxation on wealth. I don't come to the same conclusion, so don't attack me on this, but here's a direct quote:  "Double taxation is a baaaaad idea. Just the hint of it will drive a mass exodus of capital out of the USA, which will be a double whammy. It‚Äôll cause a depression in the USA + will boost growth in other countries.  If you have liquid holdings over $50 million, at some point it becomes worth it to move said money out of the USA. If this actually passed, you won‚Äôt want your money in the stock market or real estate or bonds... it would be bad.  Fixing our ridiculous, loophole ridden tax codes & corporate structures where billionaires can pay less than millionaires? I‚Äôm all in favor!"
The "Watergate Babies" who entered congress because of the 1974 election wanted to move away from the new deal coalition because they saw the white working class as racist and sexist and incompatible with the direction the party was going from the Civil Rights era.  They instead wanted to replace it with a Peace Coalition which was educated whites who hated Vietnam and Nixon, and minorities who liked the civil rights act.  Democratic leadership at that time was still very much in a new deal coalition mindset, but very quickly took a major defeat to this new wave of democrats in 1975 with the take down of Wright Patman, who was kinda similar to warren in being a huge watchdog of the banks.  After Carter and Reagan further destroyed the old democratic party leadership, the Watergate Babies had complete control of the party, and was rebranded into "Third Way Democrats" who have more or less controlled the party to today.  I like to think of the squad as the watergate babies of today, building the new coalition of white working class and non-white working class that Jessie Jackson argued for.
Secretary of Labor Sanders! Or else Secretary of Health and Human Services Sanders, so he can get Medicare for All up and running, or Secretary of Education Sanders so he can work on making public college free, or wherever else Warren thinks he fits best.
No. Senate Majority Leader.
Truth.
[deleted]
But the US already taxes its citizens' income made in other countries (if it's over \~$100K for a two-person household). Warren's plan is modeled on that, so you could only avoid the wealth tax by hiding it in very shady and illegal places.
That's very informative.  I always thought the third way as Clinton's idea, but seems like the trend predates the 90s.
Sec of Education should be someone with a background as an educator. Sec of Labor would be a perfect fit IMO.
Unfortunately since he's not a Democrat that will never happen.
Yup. They're scared.  Not only is she beating Bernie, she's now on the verge of beating Biden. You know who is next...  So that's turned all three groups against her.  Stay strong, Liz!
I'm very excited about these poll numbers for her too. Would just like to point out that polls that have results that you don't like doesn't mean they're "skewed." And the ones that have results that you do like aren't more accurate. All pollsters have different methodologies, some better than others, but the ones that have results you dislike are not necessarily "skewed." Fox News, for instance, shockingly actually has an excellent polling record.  Just important to keep that in mind, I think, as thinking polls you don't like the results of are just skewed can be dangerous.
> We'd only be deceiving ourselves if we thought Warren was the aggregate polling leader.  While that would be nice, this does mean that she's essentially *tied* for frontrunner status, and still surging. "Momentum" isn't necessarily a huge thing in polling, and we want to draw best fit lines showing her taking the lead, but really it just means she's doing pretty well.   Still needs to make big inroads in supertuesday states though.
Or becoming a citizen of another country.
She also promised her Secretary of Education would be a former teacher, IIRC.
He's currently campaigning to be the Democrat's candidate for President. Pretty sure he'd be ok taking the Senate majority leader position.
[deleted]
There's a significant Exit Tax for citizens of high wealth who renounce their U.S. citizenship.  Warren's plan ups that even further.  It would take some time before leaving became a financially beneficial choice.
Sure, they can give up their American citizenship. Dual citizens still have to pay though.
Not up to him being ok with it or not, but rather the Dem caucus voting him in. He hasn‚Äôt played as nice with them relations wise as Warren has.  But I doubt Bernie even *wants* to be Senate Majority Leader. That role becomes very bogged down in a lot of politics. The man has been gunning for chair of two specific committees: the HELP committee and the Senate Finance Committee.
It's not about what he's okay with. He's not a member of the party, he's just agreed to run as a Democrat for president. He's an independent in the Senate and therefore will not be a part of the majority, regardless of whether the Democrats take it or not.  Technically he could probably be given a senior position, but he definitely wouldn't be the Senate Majority Leader of a party he doesn't want to be a member of.
Oh, gotcha. I misunderstood you. My bad! I just see it in a lot of other political communities, that polls not good for them are basically bad, fake polls. Just didn't want that to infiltrate the Warren club. But you're totally right about the HarrisX poll probably brining her back down a bit, unfortunately.
How would that help us? The net result would be billionaires taking their billions elsewhere.
Getting cleared to spend significant time in the US for non-citizens is a pain, even if they are from the "nice" (non-"shithole") countries, and have actual jobs here. Why would someone want to give up that kind of access?
Billions of dollars?
Since she already has a dog...
I wouldn't compare Pence to Bailey. That's just an insult to Bailey.
I want a dog that looks at me the same way Pence looks at Trump
>Sexually fluid  ‡≤†_‡≤†
I'd like to think Androids are smarter. And have a few basic moral rules.
Bailey is a good boy
I know these are divisive times but there is no reason to call VP Pence an android when he is clearly a cyborg.
Pence isn‚Äôt an Android. He‚Äôs just a piece of shit.
Bailey is sexually fluid? How do you know?!
Hell, I would elect Bailey for president if I wasn't worried that he would die in the middle of his second term due to old age. So Bailey better have a young adorable puppy for VP.
Quality content
I've never heard Pence refer to his wife as "mother."   Link?
Its genius, isn't it? The orange one will tweet something and it will be over the top.  We can under his skin.
In cowering fear?
I've never had a male dog that didn't try to hump anything and everything. Male, female, leg, table, tree...its all fair game.
Hey, I‚Äôm not here to judge how he identifies  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

My dog used to hump his bed when I took the cover out of the dryer.
who are we to judge him for humping anything
The dog won‚Äôt rise up and destroy us in a robocalypse.

[here‚Äôs an article from Politifact ](https://www.politifact.com/article/2018/mar/27/does-mike-pence-call-his-wife-mother/)
That's a sign of a dog who's owner beats him regularly.
At first, I was like wait . . . what, then I actually thought about it and felt stupid I didn't get it.
Hell, I‚Äôve seen plenty of female dogs that hump everything too.
You dropped this: \\
It's a dog lol
That's true, but wouldn't we want androids to at least have Asimov's Three Laws?
That took me a minute... LOL
Dogs deserve progress and autonomy too!

First on CNN: Democratic rising star Rep. Katie Porter plans to endorse Elizabeth Warren
It's not that surprising, considering Porter was Warren's student at Harvard, but it's still nice to hear.
Great get:  * Porter is one of the few Congressional freshmen who flipped a Republican district.  * Her district had never had a Democrat in Congress before.  * She ran while supporting Medicare for All.
> Porter said that she even she named her daughter, Elizabeth, after her mentor.  If I'd known that this would have seemed a lot more obvious.
For those who might not know who she is, she's the one who [schooled Ben Carson on the department he's supposed to run.](https://youtu.be/sVWy3q2kmNM)
HELL YEAH
Katie Porter is going to face a tough re-election bid. The RNCC has targeted her seat and money is pouring in from all over the country. Please take a look at her website and throw a few dollars her way. https://katieporter.com
She is the type of person we need in the government, not all these clowns looking for a sound bite that are more worried about their Instagram account, not the actual running of the country.
Not surprising but still cool! I hope Katie Porter becomes a senator someday.
Who would have seen this coming? No but seriously this is awesome to have. Similar to AOC's endorsement of Bernie: expected but appreciated nonetheless.
This would make for a good rally in Porter‚Äôs district. California will be huge on Super Tuesday and could be what defines Warren as the eventual nominee.
I would be shocked if she doesn't endorse Warren.  Porter is Warren's prodigy in bankruptcy law.
Damn.
Hell yeah
Next CFPB chair?
 Nice
California 2020 Election   [Primary Voter Pre-Registration Deadline](http://registertovote.ca.gov/): February 17, 2020    [Primary Election](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/#apply): March 3, 2020   [General Election](http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/vote-mail/#apply): November 3, 2020
I can actually imagine her becoming Speaker of the House one day.
Unsurprising given that she was Warren's student. However, does this help Warren? Since 1976 - the birth of the modern primary system - there have been 8 open primaries (i.e. no incumbent President running). The winner of Iowa has gone on to win the nominee in 6 of 8 of these elections. The two exceptions are 1988 and 1992. In '88, Dick Gephardt of Missouri won. In '92, Tom Harkin of Iowa won.
Huowridiculous calling public servants stars. Stupid CNN corporate media. They still don't get it after 2016.
ye
More surprising given her very swing district, but still not that surprising.
[deleted]
[removed]
She was appointed by Kamala Harris to oversee bank settlement money, and both Harris and Warren endorsed her in the primary, so it was a little awkward
She was awesome in that exchange.  Ben Carson looked like a complete idiot (mostly because he is a complete idiot).
Also Chase's Jamie Dimon
Didn‚Äôt Warren vote Carson into that cabinet position?
[deleted]
I think protege is the word you were looking for.
Fun fact: Katie Porter is from Iowa. Perhaps she can campaign there with Warren
Porter is excellent at explaining complex topics in common sense language. She has huge middle class, moderate appeal. Warren needs those voters for the midwest.
it's a good thing she polls well in iowa then, on top of a well built ground game?
Cool story bro.
Very interesting being down goed. American sensibility that anybody remotely famous are celebrities?
I mean I agree.
Porter is my rep.   This district swung 21 points from 2016 to 2018 in the Dems favor not despite the Medicare for All, anti-Wall Street and anti-corruption Progressive positions Porter took, but because of it.  CA-45 is why I'm so bullish on Warren winning Arizona. This shit can connect with educated suburban voters
Yeah and Porter actually named her daughter Elizabeth (might be middle name; can‚Äôt remember) because Warren meant so much to her.
Removed for trolling.  If you want to participate, do not do so with vague allusions that don't align with reality.  You're not American, so you have very little leeway, this is your first and only warning.
Harris pretty much has no chance, so it's a little less awkward now. i think that's partially why she waited.
Ben Carson is a perfect refutation of the idea that if you're a brain surgeon, you must be smart.
No.
You can always look it up   https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-cabinet-confirmation-votes.html
I should have been more specific, I‚Äôm talking about the latest Republican stunt of storming into a closed door hearing with their phones video taping it to post to their twitter and IG.   But if you want the truth, yeah I‚Äôm kinda over our political system entirely. As a millennial, I‚Äôm tired of seeing these people bicker and argue over everything. Now I‚Äôll say the Democrats are no where near as bad as republicans, and I‚Äôll never vote for anyone with an R next to their name, even as an independent, I‚Äôm basically a democratic voter at this point in my life.   I‚Äôll go even farther, we are in a technological revolution and the majority of our government is old and honestly have no idea what the fuck they‚Äôre doing. Anyone with any common sense can see our society is in an upheaval because of technology. We‚Äôre all connected now. Whether we like it or not, machines will end up taking most jobs and then what? No one has any solutions, we‚Äôre too busy talking about stupid shit.   When was the last time our education policy was overhauled? Our education system should be based on science and technology because that‚Äôs the way to the future. All we‚Äôre doing is wasting time watching our planet die while we talk about a whole bunch of insignificant bullshit.   So yeah party unity is great and all but as someone who lives in California, my vote goes to democrats whether I wanted to or not. My future depends on a few states and a few million voters who obviously lack any common sense because they got conned by a con man.
That‚Äôs way better news for her than a CA endorsement.
There are a surprising number of people who are really smart in one very specific area, and complete morons in literally every other aspect of their lives.
He baffles me
I mean, she literally did and then reversed it after pressure.
>  Our education system should be based on science and technology because that‚Äôs the way to the future.  I generally agree with everything you wrote except for this part.  Yes, science and technology will drive global economies and solve a lot of issues (hopefully) like environmental challenges.   Anyone in pursuit of $$$ should direct their educational paths in this direction.  However do you ever wonder how we get people like Zuckerberg or others who become beyond-government powerful with so little insight into the impact of what they‚Äôre doing?  It‚Äôs vitally important that arts, humanity, history, etc... are all part of a well rounded educational system.    Further, when it comes to jobs that won‚Äôt be taken away, that don‚Äôt require STEM aptitude, these fields are very well suited for many people.   I‚Äôm not saying they shouldn‚Äôt also receive a proper science education.  That‚Äôs still vitally important for everyone to understand and accept instead of reject out of ignorance and fall into false beliefs, but I think it‚Äôs important for a society to continue to pursue these other fields as well.
ah, my bad. i thought this was a dig at AOC especially since the article seems to be comparing ‚Äúrising stars‚Äù and endorsements.
We're all ready to get this party started, but it's still too early for a lot of the established names to throw weight around. Plus, this is good publicity. Warren always needs it.
Pretty much yeah. I have no doubt, If I was talking nuerosurgery and things around that with Carson he'd completely school me and really most people in the world even if he still sounded half asleep as he does. But on anything else? He comes off pretty damn clueless.
Ohhhh.  So your question wasn't actually a question and you knew the implication you were trying to make was a lie the whole time?  Well then, consider this a warning for trolling.
Nah I like AOC, we need more young people in the government. She was a regular person who got voted in for her ideas, not just because of her party affiliation. I just can‚Äôt stand how everything has to be party line votes. It‚Äôs like no one can think for themself and have an opinion anymore. I mean, we all have common interests but all we do is shout out the differences.
Sen. Warren to Wells Fargo CEO: "You should be fired." (C-SPAN)
If every state could contribute one Elizabeth Warren to the US Senate, we might be able to fix this nation.
Stuff like this is why I'm on board with Warren. Wow she goes hard here and drills that slimy POS. If she's not President, at the very least she needs to be Secretary of the Treasury.  He tries to make every answer a canned commercial for WF "I'm very proud of our credit card products at Wells Fargo..." and she cuts him off I love it. Also, and maybe this is just a pet peeve, but I really,  REALLY hate how banks call their crap "products". It's not a product, you can't "buy" a credit card or a loan or whatever... those are financial agreements between two parties that each in kind will hold up their end. A product is an item that has a set perceived value  BTW I work in finance and I've worked at a large bank (not WF) and while I believe I worked for one of the mostly good ones, there's still stuff that goes on behind closed doors that the account holders aren't aware of. For example, do you know that banks have their own unique credit scoring system that factors into whether or not you get approved for a credit card or loan? You could legit have a 750 credit score from TransUnion, but the bank's arbitrary system identifies you as a high risk person and assigns you a score of 620, which according to underwriting polices means you're an automatic turn down. I saw this happen many times over, and while it did seem to improve in the final months before I left, this still should 100% be illegal.   We need people like Elizabeth Warren to bring real, meaningful change, and she's the only candidate who is passionate about protecting consumers' rights and will see to it that you as an individual are protected from slimeball companies like Wells Fargo, who by the way are still engaging in gross, egregious violations of various kinds.
I think this is why a lot of people gravitate toward Warren. Powerful villains live among us, and she's one of the only people brave enough to name them and demand better, right to their faces.
This is the kind of planning that brought me on board. In questioning him she had EVERYTHING on him and knew how it would start and end.
How about imprisoned?
The younger generations lean left because democratic politicians seem to be the only ones who give a shit
This was one of the most powerful things to ever be uttered in the senate. 12/10 would watch again
This is one of my favorite E Warren videos.
How much you want to bet that crap on his arm was some "Better Call Saul"-level BS trying to evoke sympathy? Also, an excellent display of the "Never ask a question you don't already know the answer to" rule.
So we'd have fifty copies of our best selves? That could do it.
What distinguishes her from sanders?  The two might go at each other a bit as time goes on, but I see the two as very similar.
[deleted]
Policy wise they‚Äôre very similar. Bernie has more of a wrecking ball approach while Warren‚Äôs is more surgical and detailed.   Other than that I like Warren because:  She‚Äôs younger  More universally relatable (looks like your aunt, from Oklahoma, uses personal stories, was a special needs teacher and Sunday school teacher). I think Bernie‚Äôs age and Jewish heritage will work against him (sad but likely true). Warren doesn‚Äôt at all come off as a ‚Äúscary socialist‚Äù.   Better credentials (Harvard Law Professor, lawyer, created CFPB) while Bernie is more of a career politician.  Wasn‚Äôt previously defeated in a presidential election
They‚Äôre relatively similar policy wise. I like Warren, because I think she‚Äôll be easier to work with and more effective than Bernie at actually getting the policies implemented. I also think she‚Äôll be able to develop stronger relationships with foreign leaders.
For me personally, and I appreciate what Bernie has tried to do to protect consumers, but Warren has been very prominent in helping to create the CFPB, opposed BAPCPA, and has authored or co-contributed to countless financial regulation and commercial law textbooks. I really appreciate her steadfast campaign to improve what is boring to 99% of people. Bernie OTOH, goes for more of the sexy talking points in finance (minimum wage hikes, campaign finance reform, audit the Fed, etc). Don't get me wrong, all of that is great and again I'm really glad he's a bulldog on that stuff, but Warren is a bulldog for the parts of finance that are behind the scenes and things that are screwing you and I over on a regular basis and not even aware of it.  Finally, there's the personal aspect of Warren transforming from a Republican to a Democrat. That speaks to me, because I used to be a Republican until I got into finance and started reading books.
My general impression is that Sanders is more "this is the problem" and Warren is more "this is the solution"  They complement each other well that way.
As others have noted, I am also concerned with Bernie's age especially. He is in good health now but this is the most difficult job in the world, and stress is hell on your body. Assuming best case scenario: he would be almost 90 years old at the end of his presidency. The chances of him making it through the next 9 years with all of the vigor and vitality a president needs, is slim.   I like Bernie a lot, but age does not wait.
Sanders ultimately wants to push the US towards socialism, he doesn't see capitalism as viable.  Warren sees capitalism as the best system, but recognizes that as operated in the US it has serious issues, and wants to regulate the fuck out of it.
[removed]
The big difference between Bernie and warren for me is that warren is willing to take corporate donations in the general election
I think it's the optics...  With money you get the sense that YOU are the product in the end (which I think isn't too off base), and that feels really bad as an end user. But on the inside, absolutely agree it makes most sense to conceptualize them as products and manage them like you would any other product line.
Thanks!  You provided a bunch of info I didn‚Äôt know about her.  I agree that Bernie‚Äôs age could hurt him in he election, but I think warren is lumped into the ‚Äúcrazy socialist‚Äù talk with sanders.  If that‚Äôs not mainstream yet, you can bet it will be if she faces off against Biden and/or trump.  That being said, do you think she can take down trump?  Or, at least, has a better chance than sanders?
 Not that this should add that much weight to it, but I also like the idea of voting for a woman. My country has been voting dudes into the white house 45 times in a row, I wouldn't mind seeing that tradition shook up a little bit finally.
Don‚Äôt forget her work in consumer protection and bankruptcy law. I think that is something she really needs to play up to win the mid-West
Not saying I buy into this sort of logic but based on past results isn't being a woman worse than being Jewish for the general election? Also, I don't think Warren, Sanders, Biden, or Trump can use the age thing since they're all so old.
Thanks for the explanation.  I think I need to look up the definitions of capitalism and socialism.  I thought regulated capitalism was more or less socialism.
I agree these big banks should be broken up. I do not agree with cancelling all student debt. The lower income folks need to have a larger share of their debt canceled than the upper class. I don't support equality of outcome as a general principle, but I do support redistribution.
Why are you getting downvoted?  Do you have evidence to support your claim?  I don‚Äôt know how to look up which candidates accept donations from who and how much :(
If you posted a link and it was removed, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate a DM!
Pete Buttigieg, while I don't like him as a candidate, was correct when he said something to the effect of all Democrats being lumped into "crazy socialists." Don't pay any attention to that BS, focus on the candidate that you think will help America the most.
I think most pundits will have a hard time actually calling Warren a crazy socialist. Every indication points to her rejecting that title all together. She's a very experienced and faithful capitalist who knows what the system needs to keep the average American above water.   I think Bernie's open acceptance of the label of democratic socialist is (albeit unfairly) toxic. Uninformed older voters are terrified of the word socialism from cold war propaganda, and stop listening as soon as their hear that.   Because of this, and probably his age, I don't rate his chances against Trump as highly as Warren's. Voters in rural Arizona and Wisconsin and Michigan will happily listen to an Oklahoman Capitalist. They rejected Trump in 2018 and show signs of going Blue. Warren is the path of least resistance getting there in my opinion.
You should go to one of her rallies. She‚Äôs a great speaker, answers questions directly, no hesitation, has clearly thought deeply about the concerns of American citizens of all stripes (appears to have empathy). I‚Äôm sure she has anticipated how she would debate our criminal in chief, no doubt has several layers of ideas.
Absolutely. And I don‚Äôt think a whole lot of people know that she provided a lot of the policy knowledge for Occupy Wallstreet.
1. Yes and 2. Warren can only use in comparison to Bernie. Although they‚Äôre both old they‚Äôre at a critical point where I feel that Warren could do two terms but Bernie is significantly older than the already old Warren and I feel could only do one term most likely. Therefore that‚Äôs a big advantage Warren has over Bernie
That's how it's sold by the right in the US, but it's not correct.  Socialism is an economic system in which rather than one person controlling the means of production, a "capitalist" controlling the capital, in socialism the workers own the businesses and means of production.
A student debt plan without college for all is just kicking the can for another decade or so

Warren and Buttigieg are the two candidates that are philosophically and logically sound enough to essentially be their own communications directors.  Clearly an oversimplification, but it‚Äôs incredibly obvious that they‚Äôre savvy enough, and more importantly: rock solid in their beliefs that they‚Äôre competent and can be trusted to not completely shoot themselves at some unexpected time, in response to a random question that could come their way at any moment. They can converse on their own without a teleprompter and generally be just fine, if not stellar.  I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a huuuuge relief to their campaign staff, as opposed to other candidates who, simply put, are their own biggest liabilities and prone to making unforced errors by failing to stay on message‚Äîwhich is, itself, a symptom of their lack of true conviction.
Thanks for the suggestion.  I have not attended a political rally before.  I‚Äôd be interested in attending a town hall kind of setting, but almost all of that is available on YouTube these days.  I do agree with you - she‚Äôs as well thought out as she is passionate.
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre lying or wrong (I‚Äôm definitely still learning), but I haven‚Äôt heard Bernie say anything to that effect.  I‚Äôve heard him talk about the government intervening with healthcare, drugs, gun control, child care, taxes, etc.  But I haven‚Äôt heard him talking about flipping the private sector like you described.  That is a big difference between the two candidates, though!

Good read.  Thanks!
You're forgetting one. Bernie is the most logically consistent candidate in the race. He's had the same message for 30+ years.
That's because he's not really one either. He says he's a socialist, but in the way the GOP means it, but his policies make him really what's called a social democrat, which is what most European countries are (capitalist democracies with a robust safety net).
Cool, thanks. I didn't know that and appreciate the link.
Nah I considered including him in my earlier comment. But despite his impeccable philosophical consistency, I see a lot of sides of Sanders on the campaign trail. Times when he‚Äôs pretty clearly trying hard to adhere to messaging and tone his staffers likely determined prudent, yet on these same occasions, he‚Äôs voluntarily skirted out of it, and notably because he simply can‚Äôt avoid taking bait sometimes. Again, he‚Äôs turned this kind of impulsivity into a strength of sorts, but on the other hand, it hasn‚Äôt always worked out so well for him. He sticks his foot in his mouth from time to time, and beyond that is very often conspicuously one-note when he‚Äôs reservedly on-message. I just wouldn‚Äôt group him with Warren or Buttigieg as being on their level of rhetoric dexterity and discipline. But I love the guy and appreciate his genuineness all the same (:
The way GOP means socialism is authoritarianism. So completely the wrong definition.
That would make sense then. Lol!
No problem at all! Sorry if I came off as condescending.
Yea, I think Sanders was a great candidate in 2016 but I'm voting Warren 2020 for most of the reasons you laid out. I also get the sense that Bernie in person in a work context is a lot more abrasive and I expect him to have a harder time building the coalitions required to actually get his policy in place, compared to Warren.
Elizabeth Warren shines in first Democratic debate
I was talking to my dad about how I've been a big Bernie guy since he bursted onto the scene but I've really had my eye on Warren. She's certainly reinforced my intrigue.
Warren and Castro did great
I‚Äôm already very pro-Warren.  Two Warren impressions. 1) Warren did great with her answers: strong openers and closers. 2) She was keeping some of her powder dry, letting the other (weaker) candidates sort themselves out/fight amongst themselves. That approach doesn‚Äôt bother me considering she‚Äôs at the top of the lineup and this is the first debate. She‚Äôs very strategic. I think this is planned. Plus no one went after her either.   Of the others. I thought Castro helped himself a lot with very good presentation, but he‚Äôs coming from way back. Lots of substance, though. VP Potential.   Beto got rhetorically elbowed, kicked in the shins a few times. DiBlasio talked loud and interrupted frequently, to little effect.   I don‚Äôt recall so many non-Latino candidates trying to out-Spanish each other in previous elections. My snarky side says ‚Äòlet‚Äôs see where that leads.‚Äô  Gabbard and Delaney can go home now.   All the unmentioned can continue to ride the bus till the next debate. They weren‚Äôt bad, just didn‚Äôt stand out in my mind.

It also helps that she was pretty much the adult at the kiddie table at Thanksgiving. Not complaining though, her public speaking coach deserves a raise
Was it just me who sort of shriveled up when she danced around the gun question? I don't know if I read the situation right but I felt kinda bad. Otherwise I loved when the hosts would bring up a topic and she'd light up ready to answer about them or when she instantly raised her hand over private insurance companies. She is so ready to get all of her ideas and good will out there it, it makes me so happy for her.
She looked so upset that she didn't get to talk about immigration at all, but obviously it was the right move not to stoop to the level of the interrupters. The only answer she gave that I thought was a little weak was on gun control just because it wasn't as good of a soundbite. That being said, her approach of essentially - lets do the no brainer things and research the rest - is the right take. It was obviously a loaded question that fed into the conservative 'they're coming for our guns!' talking point.  &#x200B;  Other takes:  Castro was impressive in his delivery if a bit aggressive in his interrupting. This is what he needed to perk people's ears up though, and didn't take it as far as the guys at the very ends.  DeBlasio and Inslee did better than I expected, but I'm torn on DeBlasio given what I've heard from NYers.  Beto should drop, he got eviscerated on the immigration section 18 of U.S. Code wrt criminality of crossing the border. He didn't really have anything to offer but sad anecdotes and platitudes.  Ryan and Delaney, psh who cares get off the stage. Also, learn the difference between the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  Klobuchar, Booker and Gabbard were about what I expected to see from them. Gabbard needs to expand to some other issues or she will not gain much support
I was only able to catch a few minutes of the debate last night and I'm not normally  one who watches debates. Especially  about politics because I'm not big into politics. Like in 2016 when I voted I voted to basically throw my vote away. Voted for someone just as in shits n giggles because I figured  they would lose anyways. Turns out the fucker won. Anyways Warren stood out to me the most during  the debate. She sounds like shes extremely smart and we need someone smart as the next president. Total opposite of the shit bird we have now. Loved her speech on investing and creating green energy. She's right. It is going to be a trillion dollar industry and we need to start researching and creating. So far she  has my vote coming from someone who was raised republican. I still hold some conservative  views,  but also some progressive  views. I dont know what my political affiliation is honestly, but whatever it is I like Elizabeth's views the most so far.
"Shiny"  *Mal Reynolds*
Trump 2020 & beyond.
Be on the lookout for Andrew Yang tomorrow night too. All three are killer progressive candidates in my opinion.
He stood out the most tonight I think, with Warren doing about as well as I expected.  He has me thinking about a Warren/Castro ticket.
Team Harvard Law for the win!
After the debate lineups were announced I thought it would be to her disadvantage, but I think actually this played to her strengths. She was easily the winner of this leg of the debate, I think tonight Sanders and Biden will tear each other apart and it will turn voters off to both of them. Liz, coming through without that fight, will be the winner of both nights.
I was really surprised by Castro. I thought he was a corporate loser, but he might not be.
You didn‚Äôt mention Tim Ryan. I think he ended his campaign last night in that tiff with Gabbard. He can go home now too.
Booker didn't stand out at all? I thought he was one of the better debaters.
Delaney did not hear that. Delaney heard applause that will be a ring in his nose
Don't we need someone to stand out to qualify though? I know one shot isn't fair but there are 20+x candidates. Sometimes it just ain't your year
I think she had a lot of time in the first hour (and used it well), and then sort of sat back in the second hour and let the other candidates fight it out
well who can blame them when you have such captivating orators like amy klobuchar up there?
Had a lot of time in the first hour, then they forgot she existed. Frustrating but I think she gave the performance she needed to pad her lead over those other 9, at least.
She may be her own coach since that is literally how she got her start way back when.
The questions wasn't gun control, but should guns that Americans already own be taken back.  I thought she stumbled at first but I really, really appreciated her demand for further research and her distinction between gun owners.  I like that she drew attention to the fact that there isn't enough data to prove what is an effective tactic for removing guns that are already in circulation.  I respect her honesty in essentially saying "I don't have an easy answer for this specific question because we lack the data" instead of just ignoring it - it's easy to talk gun control, not so easy to talk "Do we remove them from the homes of Americans who already own them" in 30 seconds or less.  "Take 'em back!" or "Leave 'em" makes for a great sound bite, but doesn't address responsible gun owners or how such a plan would be implemented.  Given that Warren has been all about releasing plans, I feel that it's reasonable to extend her the time to research and develop an appropriate plan that addresses the very intricate nature of this very charged questions.
I disagree, I love her ability to be pragmatic with sticky subjects that don‚Äôt play with her core concerns of wealth gap and environment. She has a populist message and you don‚Äôt win there if you say you‚Äôre going to take everyone‚Äôs guns away.
The question itself was completely idiotic, which didn't help.  "Should we have the government take all the guns back!? :D"
No not just you.  I feel like Booker won that point.  Gun license, gun registration.
I think it stood out that for being the candidate that has the bold ideas, her answer on guns was... less bold.  Not wrong, but not terribly aggressive.  I think her approach is correct, but I think that‚Äôs why it seemed ‚Äúweak‚Äù to some.
The only other option was to call out Todd for his stupid fucking question.  Ignoring it was the right choice, for her and the other candidates who spoke on that topic.
I thought it was a good answer to gun laws. She is from Oklahoma, i doubt she shrieks when she sees a gun, she is probably competent and realized the most realistic solution that Joe Manchin would agree to would be to see it as a public health crisis.
That was definitely her worst moment. I cringed at that answer. That being said, she had a great first hour, and she had a standout moment on healthcare that will probably be widely circulated.  Also, we shouldn't forget the shallower aspects of debate. I thought she had the best tone and inflection of anyone. She came across as intelligent, confident, passionate, relatable, and authentic. It wasn't flawless, but it was definitely a performance I am happy with.
She didn't look really content with her answer either. It was a fucking trap question though. Booker had the better response by not answering the question and instead talking about license and registration, which is a far cry from "Hey, how are you going to confiscate guns?"
>Turns out the fucker won.  Does the administration feel like you can joke about voting?
Whatever you say, Captain Tightpants.

A billionare buying his way to the Presidency isn't progressive. If he wants to do good he should be trying for a lower office rather than saying his money gives him permission to just be President on a whim.
I‚Äôm also skeptical on a personal level about his reluctance to criticize Trump.
Yang has a couple of great ideas but he's a light weight
Warren and Yang are my top picks!! They are both deep thinkers with bold policy proposals and obviously earnest, compassionate demeanors. There are candidates in this pool of Democratic candidates the likes of which haven‚Äôt been seen in decades! Ladies and gentlemen, this could be the beginning of a new golden era in American history if we elect one of these charactered leaders
Hmm. Foreign policy and immigration are her weak spots, and he did very well on those issues tonight. There are definitely worse choices.  De Blasio also did way better than I thought he would.
My wife said the same thing. A Warren/Castro ticket would be a fantastic choice.
Why are people trying to push this? Castro is so far right of Warren's policy. He's another centrist.
that Tiff, while I would never in a million years cast my primary vote for Gabbard, was glorious. I am glad someone finally said "no military industrial complex, we cannot Beat the Taliban"
I liked him though. I thought it was really nice to hear a new voice from the "forgotten" communities. I'm from a small rural town myself, so I have a bit of a bias, but as badly as he explained it, I think I understood what he was trying to say. No-one wants us to be in Afghanistan forever, but we're still in South Korea now, and that country and the world is better for it. We might have to plan to stay engaged and maintain a permanent presence in Afghanistan.
His lips disappeared while she responded, lmao
Booker is pretty familiar. He didn't say anything I felt like I hadn't heard from him before.
It was weird to hear him talk about pharma money like he did...he's taken hundreds of thousands of big pharma donations over the years, more so than any of the other candidates in the first and second tiers.
"all foam, no beer"  "Hold on a sec, I'm just setting up my 4th burn of the night of Trump.  Did you catch that? I burned Trump!"
I honest to god couldn't remember a single response that Amy Klobuchar had. She was so unremarkable and I think she'd be eaten absolutely alive by Trump on the debates.  Also, Tulsi Gabbard had really. weird. pauses. and. slllooowwdooowwnnnss. in her speech that drove me a little nuts. Also, shoehorning her military service into every answer that doesn't call for it got old to me. Weirdly though, I left the debate with Gabbard being slightly more positive than before the debate, but not by much.
In that case she should give herself a raise
Plus, no matter the answer of confiscate or not, you're going to piss off people from both sides of the issue. Saying "hey we need to treat gun violence like the public health crisis it is and RESEARCH a solution that works for all Americans" is something that almost all people, gun owners or not, can realistically get behind.  It wasn't a soundbite answer, but I think it was the best answer on the issue. (And that's coming from somebody who if they had their personal way would repeal the 2nd amendment completely)
Agreed, it could've been delivered smoother, but I liked the acknowledgement for research on effective solutions. I think she should've borrowed the short-term and long-term distinction used by Delaney. She couldve easily said common sense gun control laws will have an immediate impact followed up by long-term research and investigation in the root cause of the gun violence pandemic to develop solutions that target the problem and not lawful gun owners.  Getting data to form a solution IS a legitimate plan, so there was no reason to be uncomfortable with it. Avoiding a hard yes or no on whether to take guns away was smart, it's a very inflammatory topic and we don't even know if it's a good idea yet.
"How does a gun buyback work?" - Chuck Todd  It's, uh, literally in the name, Chuck.
I agree with his point but the argument from the right is about constitutional validity. Driving a car isn't a right as owning a gun is. He's treading a slippery slope.
But that answer the question about should the government remove guns that are already in people's homes.
Nope and I've learned my lesson.
I‚Äôm really concerned that we‚Äôre so focused on $12k a year that we aren‚Äôt focusing on the true causes of income inequality.
He essentially wants to end welfare.  What a lot of the Yang Gang doesn‚Äôt bring up is that you have to opt out of all government assistance like SNAP, Medicaid, etc in order to get UBI.
It really grinds my gears when people and media call a VAT a "robot tax"....  Not to mention he is dishonest with his numbers. The only way a VAT could barely work is if it taxes daily goods too.
Yeah, I feel you there. I think his tactic is trying to bring people in from both sides and he doesn't want to alienate Trump supporters, but it's not how I would approach it either. Either way a lot of his ideals are far left and ones that actually aim to help people and I think he's worth serious consideration. And of course posting support for a different candidate than the sub you're in gets you horribly downvoted, but so it is.
Couldn't agree more :)
Castro also might put Texas in play. Beto should run for Senate there.
De Blasio was surprising and showed that he has executive progressive experience. Did you hear his allusion to Pete and the South Bend shooting? He's a tough mayor and although Warren won tonight's debate, he stood out for sure.
De Blasio is a solid speaker and debater who would lose to Trump as he is likely the only pol that New York hates more than Trump.
I agree; I was so prepared to hate De Blasio, but I was very impressed.
Most definitely! I imagine he could help solidify Florida and honestly he has the most comprehensive plan on immigration by far. Warren is very good at admitting when someone already has a good plan (saying 'I'm with Bernie' on M4A last night being a great example) and I think this is an area where she could really benefit from Castro's experience and expertise.
Because veep is to build a coalition not really to do a anything.
Castro isn‚Äôt a centrist...
In what way is he a centrist?
He really isn‚Äôt. His positions on immigration in particular are insanely progressive and groundbreaking, and centrists don‚Äôt exactly say things like ‚Äúreproductive justice.‚Äù The fit with him and Warren from a political courage perspective is very good so far.
Having a far left prez with a far left veep is how we lose the general. The veep needs to bring in demographics that might not feel as compelled to vote for Warren because of how far left she is. She polls pretty terrible with moderate and conservative dems (which surprisingly do exist).  Down vote if you want but it's just a fact that she polls poorly outside of the most liberal of Democrats
Buttigieg?
His take was maybe a little extreme even if it has more realism than any of the other candidates. Simply put he will not make it far with the current dem climate talking like that. Personally I feel that complete disengagement is possible but obviously not as simple as just 'pull errybody out'. Its a complex issue and imo it was poorly calculated trying to make that point in this format.
Booker completely changed his campaign into a progressive one last night
Ah, I see. I'm unfamiliar with a large number of the candidates, so he really stuck out for me. He wouldn't be a surprising choice for veep, imo.
But why do we have to argue on their terms? Part of winning public debates is  setting the terms of that debate. That was the strategy of the right from about the 1970s forward when they more or less developed novel legal theories to change how we interpret the 2nd Amendment - they didn't argue according to the terms of widely held understandings, but offered new terms altogether. Or think of something like M4A.     Besides, sure driving a car isn't a right in the Constitution, but it's arguably much more central to daily American life and an essential "right of citizenship" (in the community sense), especially given our history of segregated public transit and the freedom of mobility that driving provided lots of people. And I'm an urbanist who wants to massively expand public transport at the expense of driving cars!
Good on
The main cause of inequality is the disparity in inter generational wealth. I‚Äôm not a Yang supporter but a guaranteed $1000 a month provides a cushion that allows individuals to undertake a variety pursuits- educational, entrepreneurial, or otherwise.  It could replicate the safety net that wealthier people have their entire lives.
Yeah exactly. His UBI plan is basically paying poor people to fuck off while allowing things to get much worse.
I think UBI is worth discussing and putting on our radars. It will be the future, but we need to establish the future first. If we make UBI a priority before we tackle the issue of, y'know, making it another 40 years as a planet, then we've got our priorities mixed up.
The only feasible way ubi is happening is if we have Medicare for all or some other universal baseline of healthcare.
If somebody would get more benefit/value from staying with existing programs, wouldn't that option be a good thing
Beto going back to run for Senate and Castro in the VP slot could definitely put Texas in play.   Now I really want this to happen.
He will not be able to win it, but forcing the GOP to defend somewhere they would not normally have to defend, as well as the boost to down ticket races would be a victory in itself.
BDB did better than I thought, but he's still a POS. He's not a progressive, he just talks enough like one to get elected. We had a bunch of lousy choices for mayor since Weiner couldn't stop sexting teens, so BDB was the best of the rest, but he's a spineless tool.
I keep hearing bad things about BDB from New Yorkers, so I will reserve judgment.
He's a New Yorker, you don't rise to the top of that city without being something of a presence.
Nah, you're underestimating how much New Yorkers hate Trump. Trump wins by a mile on that score.
why do they hate him? I'm genuinely confused by it all. I'm in upstate and from where I am sitting it seems like he did pretty good with what he had available and accomplished some pretty tough tasks (universal pre K, $15 minimum, PAID sick leave) all without destroying the NYC economy.
I was really surprised to like him during the debate. He's now on my VP short list. It could bring out Hispanics who usually don't vote just like Obama did, especially as immigration continues to be a hot topic. There's nothing wrong with Obama 2.0 as VP.
Exactly.
his name isnt literally bernie sanders.
You lose the general by picking people that dont mobilize voters. Trying to "balance the ticket" will get you another Clinton. Pick the people that are attracting the biggest crowds of young voters.
Yes I was shocked with his aggressive shunning of pharma money. Its what he needs to do but it doesnt change his past of taking huge donations from the industry. Its an apology tour just as much as Gabbard walking back her anti-lgbtq views is.
Not to mention cars didn‚Äôt exist when the constitution was made, while guns were. That maybe has a tiny bit to do with that.
I agree UBI is important and will be necessary in the future.  I‚Äôd rather we implement it before it‚Äôs an emergency, I just don‚Äôt like Yangs version of UBI that replaces government assistance.  $1000 a month shouldn‚Äôt disqualify you from social security, SNAP, etc.
UBI is a necessary discussion, but no one wants to talk about how it would de facto create a sharp have/have not divide. I don‚Äôt see a way around this, and no one is discussing it.
It‚Äôd be better for UBI to actually be universal and not affect your other benefits.  It‚Äôs also kind of reverse means testing so that only wealthy people can take advantage of it.
This is a good point. I mean, having to last minute rush resources to defend the upper Midwest blue shield definitely took a hit on the HRC campaign.
MSNBC‚Äôs Chris Matthews defends Bloomberg against multiple sexual harassment claims, criticizes Liz for believing the women. That‚Äôs because Chris Matthews was also accused of sexual harassment claims in 1999.
Plus there's the fact that the woman's story has been corroborated by another coworker. A man, if that matters (it shouldn't).  Bloomberg told an employee to get an abortion to her face and then straight-up lied about it in the debate stage.
Chris Matthews is just a Fox News pundit who got lost on his way to his first day of work.
Chris Matthews is terrible. He talks over his guests. He is rude and has zero understanding of what is means to be a democrat.

Bloomberg lied in both of his debates about stop and frisk and his so-called opposition to it.

Although I agree with you on Bloomberg you really should have gone after sanders‚Äô fuzzy math and lackluster resume.
It was corroborated by coworkers, and substantiated by NBC, who said they had formally reprimanded Matthews for his behavior (citation: [https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/nbc-chris-matthews-sexual-harassment](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/nbc-chris-matthews-sexual-harassment) ). Just one sexual predator (Matthews) sticking up for another (Bloomberg), and all the victims are conveniently subject to NDAs.  We should collectively stop pretending Mr. Matthews has any ability to speak to the credibility of anyone else's accusations.
And brought a bunch of ~~paid~~ shills to viciously boo Warren every time she opened her mouth and cheer all of his lies.  He really, truly did get in this just to kill Liz's campaign. He doesn't care about Bernie because he knows nothing will get done. His presidential campaign is literally the physical manifestation of the Ann Coulter tweet.  Edit: they weren't paid to go, I shouldn't have said that, but there's no way his contingent wasn't directed to be extremely anti-Warren.
# #FireChrisMatthews  Let‚Äôs get this trending pls
Alternatively... #CancelChrisMatthews
I've said the entire time that if they'd do it to Sanders they'd happily do it to Warren. They've ignored her and hurt her repeatedly throughout the campaign, but that's 'normal' media bias. Chris Matthews has repeatedly crossed the line this cycle and he's got to go.
It better not
yes, but they still covered it up. Chris Matthews is also with MSNBC, not NBC
From what I've read, "The right-wing Daily Caller reported in 2017 that MSNBC had paid a $40,000 settlement in 1999 to an assistant producer on Matthews‚Äô show over inappropriate remarks he had allegedly made. USA Today then reported that ‚Äúthe network's investigation into the incident found that the remarks were inappropriate and sophomoric and in poor taste, but not meant as propositions,‚Äù and Matthews received a formal reprimand. But the network would not elaborate further on the employee‚Äôs departure and compensation package."  Daily Caller's not a credible source, but given Chris Matthews' behavior, I believe it.
I've found it just utterly bizarre when people say Bloomberg entered to stop Bernie.  Bernie was stagnant or fading when he got in the race, while Warren was at the height of her billionaire-tear fueled rise.
That tweet wasn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing for warren. If anything it was a compliment
He almost admitted to buying Congress people.  I think it is fair to assume his chorus was compensated too.
 Bloomberg sucks but he had the same number of debate tickets as every other campaign and there's no evidence whatsoever that "paid shills" made up any portion of the debate audience. I really wish this sub wouldn't propogate S4P-style conspiracy theories without any factual backing.
     **#FireChrisMatthews**    Love it.
What‚Äôs the difference?
Bloomberg taking votes that likely would otherwise go to Biden on ST might singlehandedly hand Sanders the nomination. He's running attack ads on Sanders but just being in the race is helping him more than anything he says or does.
[removed]
I doubt Bernie would still be in this if Warren hadn‚Äôt been forced off message with the ‚Äúelitism‚Äù and healthcare debacle.  Biden and Pete got away with murder by leaning into every sexist epithet you could throw at a woman politician at Warren. It‚Äôs probably the moment when I started really souring on Pete, looking back on it now.
Right but that's just a tweet, Bloomberg is running a billion dollar campaign to stop her.
Fair enough, but his contingent was quite clearly anti-Warren all night. No way that wasn't coordinated.
Yeah I guess the audience is all pro-discrimination, pro-hide your taxes and pro-illiteracy.  Yeah.  Sure.
To be fair though, non-campaign seats were apparently 2500 a pop and the typical Sanders or Warren supporters aren't going to spend that.
same owner, different network. Point is, NBC sucks for covering up Matt Lauer's history of creepy behavior, and MSNBC also sucks for letting Chris Matthews say crap like this (after just comparing Bernie fans to nazis) with no consequences
Bloomberg fully intends to run third party, spilt the Trump opposition, and do what he's always done, help a Republican golf buddy get re-elected.
Missing the point on purpose to plug a Rule 11. Please don't do that.
[removed]
The Bloomberg supporters that were given tickets cheered for Bloomberg. I'm not sure why we need to weave some bizzare conspiracy where they were paid shills or DNC plants.  Maybe they were coached, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were paid to be there. As someone who got called a paid shill dozens of times for having the audacity to support Hillary Clinton on reddit in 2016, I think that isn't an accusation that should be thrown around wildly when there is **no hard evidence whatsoever** that it occurred.  >pro-illiteracy  Sanders' constant caping up for socialist autocrats is awful, he 100% deserved to be booed for his terrible defense of it, and charactererizing opposition to that stance as "pro-illiteracy" is disingenous as hell, get out of here with that nonsense.
Exactly!
I mean, I like Sanders, but I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying. She got "forced off message" by having sexist labels thrown at her by moderate candidates, which caused her to back off the fighter mantra that gained her such a following and allow her opponents to define her. I'm saying that that, combined with Sanders' bounce back after his heart attack, is what caused her to drop in the fall.   We saw that in her getting her highest marks in these past two debates. People like her when she's ripping people's arms off strategically.
I don't think it's a wildly thrown accusation at all. The crowd almost unanimously booed when Warren called for Bloomberg to release his taxes. That's not a hard evidence but we all can use common sense here. There was a clear trend the entire debate of Bloomberg and Biden getting audience support and the progressive candidates getting booed. 'Maybe they were coached' is making light of that.
Exsqueeze me.  Have fun calling me disingenuous on the internet and for some reason pulling big H into this.... but I‚Äôm going to continue calling out disingenuous booing.
> The crowd almost unanimously booed when Warren called for Bloomberg to release his taxes.  While I agree it *sounded* that way, that doesn't mean that's the way it was.  The way they had the audience mic-ed could have just been the mic being closer or more centered over a group of Bloomberg or Biden supporters.  Or it could have been the audio mix not being balanced.  There was no way at all to say, with any evidence, that "the crowd almost unanimously booed", at that time or any time, same goes for cheering.  Point being, as Warren said her self in the last debate, she believes in science, and we shouldn't turn to accusations when there isn't actual evidence and as much as we may not like it, right now there is no evidence that Bloomberg or any other candidate paid for or had more supporters in the audience than another candidate.  Finally, arguing over this is just petty and takes us off message, which is that Bloomberg shouldn't be the nominee for a host of reasons, most of which Warren accurately pointed out during the debate.  Leave the conspiracy theories to the other candidates and lets focus on the fights that are worth fighting which are the ones that will convince voters to vote for Warren instead of any other candidate.
. @VanJones68 : ‚ÄúI think this party needs to give her a second look because Elizabeth Warren tonight did the whole thing, she did it well, she made no mistakes. I think she‚Äôs probably gonna get the least attention but she deserves the most.‚Äù
Can you imagine what this race would look like without her?  I was thinking about that yesterday, and it motivated me to turbocharge my donations.  We‚Äôre taking her for granted. I think people are getting distracted by the huge field and crazy news cycles.   Van Jones is right: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified we don‚Äôt have anyone else with the ceiling and the breadth.‚Äù  She‚Äôs put in the work - she‚Äôs prepared, she‚Äôs the best candidate my a mile. Persist!
Warren somewhat stalling is really puzzling to me. She has the most comprehensive platform yet so many people are willing to overlook her for reasons beyond me.   My parents, newly minted trumpublicans, despise her which is part of how I know she‚Äôs compelling - the establishment is afraid of her which also explains why she‚Äôs seemingly intentionally overlooked.   I appreciate Sanders bringing a progressive populist movement around in 2016 but I really wish he sat this one out.  If not Warren, Sanders is fine but I think Warren is the stronger and more capable candidate.
I'm confident that Liz Warren terrifies Trump.   She knows exactly how to handle an unruly child.
Why is she not getting the same level of attention? I truly think she's a good balance between Sanders and Biden/Buttigieg, is very personable, ton of experience. I mean even the "loser" of Iowa, Biden, is getting more attention for coming in fourth while Liz was third! It sucks to hear, "Oh Sanders has a lock on NH, Biden has a lock on SC." but nothing on Warren.
Just signed up to make calls and send texts for her. Can't believe how little coverage she's getting.
most major news channels are owned by the adversary.
I don't understand why Nate Silver's endorsement primary ignores Warren's endorsements. Every other candidate gets updated daily but not Warren:[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-endorsements/democratic-primary/)There were a whole bunch from Iowa, but I lost my link now...     Latest ignored endorsement is news from WMUR:-  "**KEY ENDORSEMENTS FOR WARREN.** Two high-profile and respected New Hampshire Democratic leaders are endorsing Elizabeth Warren on Friday, saying she is the candidate most capable of defeating President Donald Trump and working on behalf of all Americans.  State Sen. Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua and longtime party activist and former state Rep. Judy Reardon of Manchester are on board with the Massachusetts senator‚Äôs presidential bid.  The endorsements come hours before Warren and six other Democratic presidential candidates take the stage at Saint Anselm College for their eighth debate of the campaign.  Warren‚Äôs campaign said they join ‚Äúmore than 685 New Hampshire elected officials, party leaders, political activists, and community leaders" who have publicly endorsed her.  ‚ÄúElizabeth understands the challenges working families face because she has lived them,‚Äù said Rosenwald, a first-term senator and former seven-term New Hampshire House member who served as House Deputy Democratic Leader.  ‚ÄúShe has built comprehensive plans to tackle those problems and her time as a teacher shines through when she explains them to people.

I think the amount of attention the primaries (and politics) are getting this year has probably made it difficult to navigate. Like, there are constant scandals, jabs, and conspiracies that steal the limelight. The number of candidates is also distracting - it leads to an impression that no candidate is particularly strong, or that the less famous candidates don't have a shot.  Everyone anticipated those effects I'm sure - its politics - but Warren is hurt by needing strong numbers in later states right now. It's made worse because of how fast the news cycle is moving without much of her in it. I think it sucks that the media is hardly covering Warren right now, but that's not really something she can control.   So you have very engaged (and divided) voters from Day 1 who aren't seeing much of her. We need to keep up visibility through volunteering (and hopefully more canvassing).  On the other hand before Day 1, when Warren was surging, the primaries' news cycle was much slower. If only we could still be establishing platforms and discussing policy, I bet she'd be doing fine.  I hope that we get some strong numbers out of early states. Since Iowa was such a wreck, I think each race is going to get extra attention. That could bring the spotlight back to Warren at a critical moment.  I've always believed the polls are likely to underpredict her campaign due to it being grassroots (as they have in the past). We are still working with polls and very few final numbers so I'm hopeful!  Edit: And we have some great debate clips to use when she does get more notice! I lost it when she said "No." to Buttigieg's response, that would be good to keep on the backburner after he does well in NH but hopefully underperforms in the next three!
> Warren somewhat stalling is really puzzling to me. She has the most comprehensive platform yet so many people are willing to overlook her for reasons beyond me.  Misogyny sucks.
Personally? I think she tried to court Sanders supporters instead of Biden supporters, and she‚Äôs still seen as Bernie-lite, which couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. She needs to separate herself from him if she wants to win.
I totally agree.
The answer is simple: people don't. Are about policy. Warren almost certainly has the most detailed plans. However, the average viewer wants everything described in one sentence, and if there is any nuance it is too much.
I'd hardly say 'stalling' ! - she overtook the 'most electable' front runner Biden!   Yeah Sanders and the mayor are ahead of her in one tiny state, but she showed she's more electable than the one who's electability is his only ticket to POTUS.     The media is not reporting it, but that's the news of IA
The answer is simple: people don't. Are about policy. Warren almost certainly has the most detailed plans. However, the average viewer wants everything described in one sentence, and if there is any nuance it is too much.
For some reason the dip happened after she came out with her plan to pay for M4A.  And I don‚Äôt know why, her plan made sense, and was supported by Obama‚Äôs head of Medicare.

Why do you wish Sanders would have sat this one out? Sanders and Warren have very similar policies but Sanders is more popular. Why not Warren sitting it out?
Good teachers are experts at it.  Special Ed teachers also know how to put on a poker face and shield themselves from whatever is hurled at them.    Warren is ready to take on Trump.
[removed]
I try not to go conspiratorial, but in this day and age, it's hard.  I think MSM really doesn't want her getting the nomination.  It shocks me how little they talk about her and the only stories that they seem to grab onto with her are negative stories, e.g. the exodus of WOC from her NV campaign or where there is a confrontation, her and Sanders drama or most recently her response to Buttigieg's race question at the debate (this one is working towards her benefit though.)  I thought it was just me being paranoid, but them I saw certain commentators, like van Jones calling it out.  There seems to be a conscious act to keep her out of the narrative.
I am happy you like Warren but lets not call the rest of the candidates running names.  Lets keep discussion civil and policy based.
I agree but don't you think the moneyed interests that oppose her are behind her erasure?
Didn‚Äôt seem to pull Hillary down. I think it has more to do with identity politics than policy. Which sucks because Warren is so relatable to so many people.
I really oppose sanders more populist leanings and I am think that being a mayor of a small town doesn‚Äôt really prepare you to be president.  My ranking for president is warren 1 and Biden 2 (and frankly, much of the field over the Iowa frontrunners).  I think warren may have overestimated the ‚Äúideological left‚Äù vs the ‚Äúpopulist left‚Äù though in a way that sanders has been extremely deft at navigating
[removed]
Removed for Rule 4 for your nickname and comments on Pete.
Sanders is a lot older and that worries me. He‚Äôs 78 now. 79 come election. 83 come a second election. 87 at the end of a second term.   Dudes old. Very old. There‚Äôs no guarantee he makes it far into a first term, let alone a second and that worries me greatly.   Warren is similar, like you mentioned, and also a lot younger. I have faith Warren will be around longer.
> Why do you wish Sanders would have sat this one out? Sanders and Warren have very similar policies but Sanders is more popular.  Because even Sanders supporters seem to acknowledge Liz would be better at doing the work, they just want Sanders‚Äô rhetoric.
Bernie wanted Warren to run in 2016 so why not sit it out when she is actually running?
She would've had to do the test sometime - better to have it over with.    Trump's lies are endless and thoroughly documented. If Trump ever complains about Warren's lineage, she just has to point out that Trump's grandfather ran a whorehouse.
This is a Bernie troll folks
I think it was the right thing to do. She gain points in the polls months after doing it, cozying up to M4A hurt her more in the polls than that.   It was one of the things that nagged me about Hillary not releasing her speeches - the speeches were eventually released and it wasn't a blip in the news because they were boring generic speeches. But the left had the rallying cry of "but her speeches". Bernie is making the same dumb move with his medical records. He promised to release them and is now walking that back. It's going to be "he's sick!" if he's the nominee.
Removed per Rule 1.
Ok
That no doubt has something to do with it too but they don‚Äôt like Bernie any more and he gets plenty of coverage in these discussions.
Absolutely. She‚Äôs going after the structure that keeps the monopoly in place on day one. There‚Äôs a reason they never funded the CFPB. It scares the crap out of them that the Federal government would shine a light on corrupt, abusive corporate practices.
You don‚Äôt think Hillary Clinton was impacted by misogyny?
Warren's M4A plan does not leave out mental health.  Please do not spread misinformation.  [Under my plan, Medicare for All will cover the full list of benefits outlined in the Medicare for All Act, including long-term care, audio, vision, dental, and **mental health benefits**. My plan will cover every single person in the U.S., and includes common-sense payment reforms that make Medicare for All possible without spending any more money overall than we spend now.](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/ending-the-stranglehold-of-health-care-costs-on-american-families-bf8286b13086)
A candy bar hits her like Bane on  steroids. She's got ten times more energy in a day than I will ever have. As she says, "Can you imagine if I drank coffee?"
After his heart attack odds are against him living long enough to complete one term by a almost a year.  That is also based on a 75 year old retired person and not a 78 year old with an extremely stressful job.
And Sanders' online supporters and campaign surrogates are saying she's a corporatist neoliberal liar.
We definitely don't say that
Exactly. Warren put that scandal to rest before most people were even aware the election had started. I count that as a win, in my book.
It's not even a Bernie Troll given its post history.
Because Warren can get it done and the news cycle doesn't believe he can.
But the opposition want him to be the nom.
> but they don‚Äôt like Bernie any more and he gets plenty of coverage in these discussions.  That's because they are really scared of him and are trying to spread fear and attack him.
Hillary doesn't have the charm Warren has.
Pretty sure the comment is about her being able to win the primary.
Maybe in the general but not in the primary. I thought that‚Äôs what we were talking about since it‚Äôs primary season
Definitely not all Sanders' supporters. But a very vocal subset of his supporters, talking heads, and surrogates are.  And they seem to be very focused on Warren.  Whether it is fair or not to Sanders is debatable, but I really do think these folks are burning bridges for Sanders.  Edit:  Fixed one, of I am sure, many typos.
The news cycle sees good qualities in Pete Buttigieg which I cannot understand at all
Nobody who worked with him believes he can. Clinton was right about that.
[removed]
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I think Warren is a much better candidate for a number of reasons. That is definitely one of them.
Doesn't have charm and is filled to the brim with hubris  Edit: I'm talking about Hillary, not Elizabeth
Just because she won doesn‚Äôt mean she didn‚Äôt face misogyny. As a Bernie supporter in 2016, I saw a ton of misogyny against her. It was really gross.

>"...maybe, just maybe, when Bernie Sanders said, 'It is not good enough for someone to say "I'm a woman! Vote for me!"',[^(\[85\])](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/307014-sanders-dems-must-move-beyond-identity-politics) he was wrong. The problem isn't that anyone thinks that's good enough. The problem is that no one does. On the other hand plenty of people seem to think that a candidate being a woman is a good enough reason *not* to vote for her.

Indeed, so widespread is the trope it earned itself a piece in the *Onion* headlined, 'Hillary Clinton is too Ambitious to be the First Female President'.^(\[14\]) Being the first woman to occupy the most powerful role in the world does take an extraordinary level of ambition. But you could say also argue that it's fairly ambitious for a failed businessman and TV celebrity who has no prior political experience to run for the top political job in the world - **and yet ambition is not a dirty word when it comes to Trump.**\*"  From [Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men - Caroline Criado Perez](https://smile.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed/dp/1419729071)  \[**Bolded** emphasis mine/all sources are the sources used in the book, though the first source was cited in the introduction and not in this excerpt\]  \[11\] Link from The Washington Examiner removed [Alternate Link](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/colin-powell-endorses-hillary-clinton)  \[13\] Link from DailyMail removed (This was said in a Kremlin TV interview and it did not receive much coverage in the US, the only links I could find were the original, the Intercept, and a Russian site, though [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/julian-assange-a-man-without-a-country) touched on it without directly quoting)  \[14\] Link from The Onion removed, but here is an [alternate link](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/6/11378306/hillary-clinton-lol-ambition-attack) that talks about it and has the bonus of Hillary laughing at the absurdity of it all)
You're putting words in other people's mouths. Racism, sexism, bigotry, xenophobia and all these terrible things are part of the US elections. If Clinton was able to overcome it, that's likely not the reason Warren is failing.

Elizabeth Warren jumps 6 points after debate, favorability up 9 points to 72%
It was fascinating to see her jump in points and seeing where she is siphoning off post-debate. She is drawing from Biden, Bernie, Harris and Buttigieg and undecideds, people are switching which is key for her success going forward.
This was a tracking poll of people who watched the debate and knew they would be asked how it changed their mind. So, these numbers reflect that Liz was the biggest winner of the debate, but she almost definitely did not receive a 6 point bump nationally.  &#x200B;  edit: spelling
I think she‚Äôs going to pull a lot of Bernie supporters. I think she presents a more pragmatic way to achieve success through progressive policies than Bernie.   Bernie‚Äôs ultimate downfall is that he presents progressive ideas in such an abstract sense without also proposing sound policy options to accompany them. That‚Äôs why people think progressives are idiots. On the other hand, Warren presents methodical and precise plans to achieve these goals.
It's been funny seeing all the closeted Republicans in my family rapidly pivot to hating Warren over the past two days. It's like Bernie Sanders, the prior object of their obsession, never existed.     (I call them "closeted Republicans" because they're registered Democrats, but they're the kinds who say they "wish they could vote Republican" but they're smart enough to know that's a dumb move for a Brown person.)
Seeing both debates made me much more supportive of Warren. She's got ideas, she's on point, her background is inspiring. She did an excellent job and I hope she wails on Biden in the next debate.
can‚Äôt wait for D2 results to come in
Warren had a net 8.1% approval gain, which was only second among the first night to Juli√°n Castro (+14.5). He was certainly helped by people not knowing him, while Warren was already by far the most recognized candidate onstage in night one. O'Rourke and Delaney actually both lost net approval
How did they choose which candidates were part of which debate?  I would have expected her to be part of the night 2 debate.
Literally the only candidate whose unfavourable numbers went down after the debate. That‚Äôs impressive. She was poised and I think answered any doubters who worried that she would be too awkward or wonkish.
I thought it was pretty interesting that she was the only candidate (at least from night one where there is data) that had a drop in unfavorability. Everyone saw some sort of gain in favorability from some people with no opinion on them gaining a positive opinion, but only Warren had a net decrease in unfavorability. Everyone else saw a 2-9% increase in people that viewed them as unfavorable.
Damn‚Äîshe‚Äôs now 4th‚ÄîKamala leapfrogged her to third.
What's favorability? Looking for the question they asked people to come up with that number such as, "Do you approve of the job the president is doing?" (job approval question).
yes yes yes yes yes
Interesting graph, Warren is the only major candidate who did not loose many supporters (see thickness of the lines on the left side).
She flipped me. I love Bernie and voted him in 2016, but Warren is clearly the sharper, more energetic, and more electable candidate.
Shows it plays a lot into messaging and substance.   Most people aren't really locked on a candidate. Hell I have four that I really want, and I wouldn't consider myself locked at all on Warren. I don't see her falling out of my four choices, but Castro for example made a strong pitch for me as a fifth choice. Same with Buttigieg, I only began to consider them once I heard them. Coming in I was Booker, Harris, Warren as my preferred order.   I really don't think anyone should be 100% on any candidate right now  It is far too early for that. We should have favorites, we should be willing to listen to the entire field, and when our favorites fuck up we should tell them why they did. And if they are actually worth our vote they'll either listen and change their minds, or be able to explain to us why they believe what they believe.   Warren is drawing people because I believe she's effectively doing that.
Just anecdotally, my Facebook feed lately has basically been [this](https://i.imgflip.com/34icfu.jpg).
According to the charts, Warren and Sanders are the only two candidates who both *gained* favorable opinions, and *lost* unfavorable opinions.  Warren is not drawing anything away from Sanders, but this data suggests they are both the clear frontrunners, with Sanders slightly leading Warren.  **Sanders is the most popular candidate**, and is still gaining according to this data.
And this doesn't reflect night 2 yet we will have to wait until tomorrow to see what the effect of the combined events is.
Interesting note.  She was the only candidate from night 1 who‚Äôs unfavorable rating went down.  That‚Äôs really odd to me.  Her favorability went up notably, and her unfavorability went down a bit which is really interesting.
Thanks for pointing out the misleading headline. When will the first post-debate poll be? Is next months debate based on new numbers with less people or still 20?
Plus he did pretty badly in the debate. I think she pulls the vast majority of his support from now.
Their new talking points were just uploaded directly into their brains via Fox & Friends.
Same I've never been this excited for a poll lol
O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs face looks likes he is wondering why he is there..just like all of us
All candidates were first split into two categories: (I) people polling >2% and (II) people polling <2%.   Then there was a lottery-style drawing for the two debates, where each debate had to include half of the candidates from each category.  What unfortunately happened was that, out of the five candidates polling above 5% (Biden, Bernie, Warren, Pete, Kamala), 4/5 ended up in one debate while 1/5 (Warren) ended up in the other. Random luck put Warren with all of the folks polling 2-5% (Booker, Klobuchar, Beto).  I'm betting the DNC will fix this for the July debates (which will also feature two 10-candidate nights) so that it doesn't happen again.
Candidates were split into two groups of higher polling and lower polling. Each of those groups was randomly split across the two nights
Harris seems to have eaten her entire first night bump. Also Sanders gained... Somehow despite having a weak debate.
Scroll down and you'll see the positive and negative approvals of each candidate before and after the debates
Don't read into it too much yet. They haven't updated for the second debate, which featured most of the major candidates.
Same. A lot can happen between now and when I vote in my primary (CA) Warren & Bernie are my #1 & #2  but based on pure alignment of policies I‚Äôm more with Liz. She seems to be getting momentum now despite a rather slow start for her campaign
An issue Bernie has had for a long time is that he has the ideas, the passion, but he's not the best at explaining his thinking or his actual policy and how he will achieve it. Warren excels at that and people are responding.  I'll be forever grateful to Bernie for shifting the debate to the left, but Warren is the president we need to help the country.
Honestly what gets me is her repeated refrain that she will fight for you. That shit resonates with me better than anything Bernie says, even if I agree with him. When Warren says she will fight for me, I believe it. I hope other people see the same thing.
I‚Äôd settle for Bernie, but I‚Äôve been on the Ewar train for a bit now because she seems like a Bernie esque candidate with more specific policy positions, better presentation of her ideas, and a clear path to implementation of her whole plan.
Dito
Right now, most people say that Biden is their #1 choice and Bernie #2, or vice versa. That shows that nobody is ideologically driven right now, and people are deciding purely on name recognition. That‚Äôll likely change soon.
I LOVE this!
I am a Sanders supporter, but I am so glad to have Warren with us at the top of the polls. It shows that unequivocal progressivism is the way to go forward in America.
That is a sign that she won the debate.
He pivoted economic without good segues constantly. Warren pivots Econ less, but when she does her segues are better. She explains her ideas where he repeats his ideas.
It will be really scary to see what will be left of Bernie's support when he makes it to the single digits. I worry all that will be left are the worst of his supporters.
Damn ‚Äî Kamala leapfrogged her and she lost support ‚Äî from 2nd to 4th.
My honest reaction to Beto was basically that if I didn't know it was this year, he looked, spoke, and debated like this was any generic 20XX election and he was a generic democratic candidate.   Completely unremarkable, over-prepared with an anecdote for every single response to the point where it felt less than genuine, and he flubbed his opportunities to stand out from the pack.  The spanish moment too, stood out as odd to me. My fiancee's first language is spanish and I'm fairly conversational in my own spanish, and his speaking definitely sounded like he had memorized phrases to say rather than trying to learn it legit. Plus, he looked confused/panicked as soon as a moderator started speaking to him in spanish and barely answered the question even after switching to english.  Cory Booker's spanish was technically worse, but that is kind of expected for a mayor from NJ as opposed to an El Paso politician. I didn't really hear Castro's moment enough to be able to comment on it, tbh.
I don't think it was bad luck at all. Gave her a chance to own the stage for a night. There will be other debates where she'll mix it up with Joe and Bernie.
I wish theyd begin narrowing it down.  I can think of at least a small handful who would be addition by subtraction.
SIGH - still seven months till Iowa. Hopefully she‚Äôs able to keep some momentum.
Yes. It's what killed Hillary in the general. "I'm with her" makes it about her. "She's with you" would have been a far better slogan, even if she didn't mean it.
Specially after that first debate Biden and Bernie both didn't come off well. Elizabeth was lucky she was in the first debate because everyone talked over each other the second night.
I would disagree hard because there is definitely one shared ideology there: beat Trump. And they believe they're best to do it. I don't agree but that can definitely be true and again, should be respected.   That is also something that can completely be turned around with time just by listening.
This is good news. I'd be happy with either as POTUS, but do prefer Sanders.
It‚Äôs fine, she got the benefit of being the big dog on stage and being calm and collected, but Sen Harris had a battle plan for the much deeper field on day 2 with the benefit of also being the only black person on the stage, she is being rewarded for that daring.   It‚Äôs a long slog keep being enthusiastic about Warren and we can see her through.
Not that surprising. There's a consistent gain of a couple percent, she didn't have the super breakout moment Harris did, and if they flipped in between they can certainly flip back.  It's still positive interest.
Spot on. Beto can speak Spanish but he had rehearsed so much he sounded like he couldn‚Äôt. He doesn‚Äôt understand he was a moment, and it passed.  Also, I am part Mexican and I was rolling my eyes so hard I may have damaged them. I mean for shits sake, this is the U.S, go ahead and speak English. No Mexican I know is impressed by politicians busting out Spanish. We don‚Äôt care. My grandparents don‚Äôt care and they prefer Spanish to English. These knobs are trying to be relevant by playing their diverse cards. Thankfully, people seem unpersuaded by the antics; The ones polling best are the ones with the best plans. Substance over nonsense.
Haven't heard the take that Beto prepared too much, but I think you're spot on. I was wondering why someone who is so great in town halls looked so lost while in a debate, but over preparation makes the most sense.
The third debate, which happens in September, will have twice the qualifying thresholds as the first two debates.  Right now, 538 is predicting only ~9 candidates to qualify.
Regardless, someone who supports both Bernie and Biden has absolutely no ideological consistency when it comes to actual policy.
>  No Mexican I know is impressed by politicians busting out Spanish. We don‚Äôt care. My grandparents don‚Äôt care and they prefer Spanish to English  I think people were impressed last round when Tim Kaine did an entire interview in Spanish on Telemundo because it showed that he was truly fluent. But pulling out random phrases isn't the way to impress, especially when you butcher those phrases anyways.   I also remember Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz fighting in spanish last election, and that was funny to me.
There is absolutely no reason or value in you deciding for someone else they lack any kind of ideological values because you don't share their choices. I am tired of this attitude and it needs to stop.
Lol yeah the legit Spanish speaking, is legit. I still think its unnecessary but you can tell the difference for sure. We all know what country we live in and I am fine with English. One side of my family speaks Tsalagi and their politicians never speak Tsalagi, always English because its a country within a country.  Hahahaa I had forgotten Cruz and Rubio trying to out cred each other. I was so excited in 2016 to see the diverse candidates and then..we elected a guy fresh out of the sheet. Oi.
The commenter said "ideological consistency" and not "ideological values". It was not an insult directed towards Biden supporters, it was a simple observation that the ideology of these two candidates is quite different and therefore if an individual is willing to support either of them, their reason for doing so is likely due to different considerations.
No, what needs to stop is the relativistic nonsense where we should all hold hands and get along because aren't we all on the same side?  No. Some of us are not on the same side. Some of us voted against the Iraq war, some of us supported it. Some of us were for integration, others of us abdicated our responsibility in favor of states' right to be racist.    You can not look at two men who do opposite things and say "it's all the same who cares" just because there is a D next to their name. The time to shut up and fall in line is AFTER the nominee is chosen, the whole point of the primaries are to fight against people who you think will steer the party the wrong way.
Exactly. I‚Äôm not trying to shame anyone, I‚Äôm just saying that policy and ideology isn‚Äôt something that people responding to polls are considering, and that the polls are almost meaningless at this stage because of that
I don't agree that people cannot find those people ideologically similar. I think its people deeply in the bubble of some candidates that get offended that people who like the other also agree.   The ideological differences between the two can definitely appear overblown to people who simply want someone they think is qualified, will improve health care, raise minimum wage, and beat Trump for example. They are ideologically consistent in that.  People need to get out of their bubbles and stop thinking that people can't like both of those candidates. It will not help us.
Sorry not sorry Bloomberg
Man, they got the year wrong but lmaooo
What‚Äôs the kill count for Warren? Delaney‚Äôs ghost wants to know...
It was pretty clear that he hasn‚Äôt been spoken to like that in a long time. I thought he was going to burst a blood vessel. His face turned several colors all at once.
Nothing says progressive like murdering a billionaire on live television.
Mike choked so hard when Warren question how many NDAs did he issued. His expression is priceless.
His reaction immediately made me think of r/WatchPeopleDieInside
pete guy here but my god the fucking cojones on Liz were beautiful to see... she practically disemboweled him
[It's been updated. And locked.](https://i.imgur.com/AkbaYty.png)
savage.
Don't worry folks, somebody was kind enough to correct the record and get the year right. https://imgur.com/a/YFSXzUR
It was amazing, you could hear his testicles being crushed during that debate.
She ended his shit!
We all knew warren was gonna drop the hammer on bloomy tonight. She exceeded my expectations
That's the second rich she killed in a debate. She's got the touch.
WOW
Warren: Sorry not sorry bout what I said
Lol amazing
What happened a year ago????
Wouldn't be too funny if he actually turned up dead......
Pete Buttigieg fan here but I always love listening to Warren and tonight she not pulling any punches. The Pete supporter in me wants to point out that she made some false claims about Pete but she was great this debate.  Edit: downvoted for saying she was great to watch?? Or because she misrepresented Pete‚Äôs plan?? https://apnews.com/daf73c527dcaf0a3f28ecb8a0c8e56c2
nah she killed him so hard that its effectively balefire, killing him 1 year in the past. "Bloomberg? He never launched a presidential campaign"
For many of us it takes about 5 months to stop accidentally writing last years date, so I sympathize completely.
He was so rusty, I had my WD-40 ready just in case
"There is no answer to this question that does not make me look awful..."   Lets run down some possible answers  * "*Gives exact number*" that is NOT going to look good  * "I don't recall at the moment" Too many to remember?  * "That is a private question" Yes, that is the problem in the first place.  No good answers.
I believe he also brought up the concept of "consensual" with regards to NDAs. It was at that part where I went ahead and lost my mind.
Best part of the debate, imo. I hope they never let him live it down. That shit is dark.
I do not understand this.  What does him signing an NDA have to do with anything?
Except she still said she'd support him if he got the nomination.  Edit:  Not sure why I'm being downvoted.  She literally said this immediately after she attacked him.  Rewatch the tapes.
Awe shit even better
Well, i would imagine the record-keeping for local politicians isn't as robust as for experienced politicians or businessmen. Honest mistakes all, i'm sure.
WoT reference üëè
So Warren is confirmed an Aes Sedai...Blue Ajah?  Or is that too on the nose?  I‚Äôm thinking White, personally.
Unexpected Wheel of Time!
The arrogance of thinking you can just saunter in at debate 9.
His lips pursing and flapping there was a beautiful moment
‚ÄúThey agreed to the agreement...‚Äù   yes, someone whose job and income were at stake were intimidated by your money and felt that they had no choice but to sign if they wanted to protect themselves      ‚ÄúMaybe they didn‚Äôt like a joke I said...‚Äù   ok, so if they‚Äôre all tame, let‚Äôs release them and hear it? Let‚Äôs hear that ‚Äújoke‚Äù?         If something is so big that they planned out a NDA for them I guarantee you it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù. Workplace harassment and discrimination is a serious issue and I‚Äôm so glad Warren called him out
Well, technically an NDA is an agreement, which is consensual... But you're buying the person's consent. Makes it a little iffy.
Yeah when one of the parties involved in the process is a mutibillionaire with a global media empire who has been a significant donor to multiple campaigns I don‚Äôt think it really is consensual.
If he has a history of making sexually aggressive comments to the point where he has had to enter into multiple NDAs then he has some significant skeletons in his closet that will be pursued.  The democrats would be better suited to have someone with a cleaner record such as Warren who does not have a history of making sexually inappropriate comments.
Lets just help make sure that doesn't happen because Warren gets the nomination.
Literally everyone on that stage has said that they'll support the nominee no matter who it is at some point or another, Bloomberg included. It's about being united against Trump in the general, not conceeding to Bloomberg. He's still got a long way to go towards getting the nomination - even longer after Liz tore him up tonight.
Why is that a bad thing? The end goal is to get rid of trump. If that means supporting Bloomberg, then so be it. This is the way.
What is WoT?
LOLWOT
Obviously she is Grey Ajah, as a legal expert.
"Lemme jump in during fucking October"  Neither Yang nor Delaney were my candidates, but at least they recognized they needed to get in early to build up their campaigns. Both of them together put in more effort then Bloomberg did in a single afternoon.   As someone who lived in Iowa and caucused there in 2016, it's beyond insulting that Bloomberg thinks he can just blitz tv ads and jump in without any foresight or pushback.
What lips?
For me it was more of a matter with him saying the word consensual around the topic of sexual misconduct. I believe he also made light of casual sexism with "Maybe they didn't like a joke I said". That workplace does not sound like the 2nd best place to work in America.
Wait, so he was basically harassing woman then when they fought back he forced them to sign a NDA to not discuss the harassment?  Why would anyone agree to that.
Blue no matter who and if you see someone pushing any the narrative on this sub downvote and report them.
Wheel of Time, a fantasy series
Ugh...it‚Äôs been so long I confused the Whites and Greys!  Most definitely Grey!
>As someone who lived in Iowa  Unfortunately for them, but fortunately for the rest of the country, everyone is going to care a whole hell of a lot less about Iowa after the giant cock up this year.  Hopefully they get put at the end of the line
>Why would anyone agree to that.  They'll be paid, rather than harassed and slandered by the public, with their life ruined.
He almost certainly paid them off and then had them sign an NDA.
Essentially the idea is he allegedly (we don‚Äôt know for certain since the NDAs keep us from knowing) committed acts of sexual harassment and then the victims sued him for it.   In order to make the lawsuits (or threats of lawsuits) go away he offered some amount of compensation to the victims on the condition that they sign the NDA.
Ah the Robert Jordan books.  I've been slowly buying them as I find them in used book stores. There's a lot of them. Anxious to start reading the series.
An Ajah for every candidate:  Warren: Grey Ajah (duh)  Bernie: White Ajah (Never gets into emotional stories, just consistently raising facts about the 1%)  Biden: Green Ajah (given how often he apparently has gotten in so many fights where he has been beaten before getting back up)  Klob: Brown Ajah (given her apparent lack of social skills and apparent trivia knowledge about Minnesota, like being the birth place of post-it notes)  Buttigeg: Red Ajah (since even if he isn't the villain he does his best to make himself appear as one)  Steyer: Yellow Ajah (since in the debates he does his best to heal everyone else's campaigns)  Gabbard: Blue Ajah (given how often she has adventures to conservative land, putting herself in the heart of the conservative media)  Bloomberg: Black Ajah (duh)
Wouldn't the public support them?  You don't harass and slander the victim.
üëç Yeah, they're good, a little slow at parts but great as a whole. Sanderson did a great job finishing up the series after Jordan passed.
It‚Äôs a great time to start, as Amazon‚Äôs TV adaptation is currently filming.
I dunno, Bernie seems much more like a Blue to me.  And Gabbard is definitely a Black as well.
They historically haven't. Usually the woman is declared a liar, attempting to ruin the life of a great man. See Dr. Blasey Ford for a recent example.
Lol where did you spend the better part of 1998? It's easy to say that now, in light of the Me Too movement (and even then there are people all too willing to sling mud at the victims), but who knows when these NDAs were signed. Bloomberg has been around a long time. I'm sure there is a trail of them throughout his career.
Many victims get lambasted by sections of the public after being harassed.  Anita Hill was targeted by the GOP and media after going after Clarance Thomas for his sexually inappropriate actions towards her.
I wish that were the case, but victims tend to be harassed and slandered even when they're making accusations against a private citizen. Make an accusation against someone powerful, and odds are good you'll be humiliated on national television, and receive mountains of death threats from your assaulter's supporters.   In a world where only [0.7% of rapists end up convicted of their crimes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/06/less-than-percent-rapes-lead-felony-convictions-least-percent-victims-face-emotional-physical-consequences/), I can see how many women decide they don't want to prolong their trauma any further and take the buyout.
(I tried to place everyone uniquely into a single Ajah. I placed Bernie as blue originally, but couldn't justify placing Gabbard into white LOL).
Yeah, I know.  A for effort.
My dream president!
I just love the last line. People are the thing that matters, not companies or corporations.   This is something that I feel gets forgotten in the field of economics every once and a while. The equations and methodologies we use equate the transactions a business does as a positive in and of itself (which true to a certain degree).   But we can't just assume that a growing GDP means a growing standard of living. We need to pay attention to the real world and how decisions effect the real world. That means people. We need to look at the lives of everyone, but especially those who are worst off in our system. We need to focus on improving their standard of living.  Anything worth measuring can't be measured by one number.
I miss being able to listen to my president speak and not feel embarrassed.  Yes, I listen to all of Trump's rallies and press conferences because i'm a junkie like that, but it just reminds me of the drastic difference in how calm, safe, and inspired I felt after Obama spoke as opposed to how frustrated, embarrassed, and insulted I feel after almost every one of Trump's performances.  Obama had the audacity to wear a tan suit while speaking to the whole nation about our future, unity and greatness. Trump grabs people by the .... while peddling anger, division, hatred, and apathy.  I'm looking forward to the first few speeches by President Warren in the same way one looks forward to an ice cold glass of water after a day toiling in the heat of a Georgian summer.
I can't wait to have a president again who is going to give us and future generations, beautiful and inspiring quotes.  Trump's best contribution so far, "Covfefe."
Just finished canvassing in CA. We‚Äôre gonna do it
Amen sister!
She‚Äôs not my #1 pick but I‚Äôm still kind of sad that she‚Äôs dropped momentum. I‚Äôd rather have her than Pete that‚Äôs for sure.

 >Trump's best contribution so far, "Covfefe."  Im sorry but while I have no love for Trump that isn‚Äôt even close to his best quote.  I have to say I‚Äôm tired of the constant negativity directed against the guy on this sub.  He‚Äôs not an idiot.  Factually speaking his best quotes are  ‚ÄúYou know, it really doesn't matter what the media write, as long as you've got a young and beautiful piece of ass.‚Äù because it shows how classy he is which shouldn‚Äôt ever be questioned of a guy who covers everything in gold.    And ‚ÄúI have a great relationship with the blacks‚Äù because it demonstrates how not racist, progressive thinking he is and how he‚Äôs a unifier based on his use of a term that became uncomfortable to use sometime in the early 1970s.    Trump really has the best words which he uses all of the time.  They are so much better than the words of one of the most respected and competent senators alive, Elizabeth Warren, and in fact the prime minister of Chyna told him so the other day in a phone call that ended when Trump slammed the phone down on him.    /s except for those quotes as he actually said that.

Removed: Trolling.  Sure is a coincidence that you hold the same opinions for Warren as you do for Hillary Clinton. I wonder what it is they have in common...
She doesn't.
Removed: Rule 7.   Update with a source and we can talk about a specific event.
Pete's got big money behind him.  There are two ways dems beat trump.  They either convert some lost republicans to vote for them, or they bring in people who didn't vote last election.  The progressive approach focuses on the latter, maybe bringing in a few Trump voters from those northern states that went red in 2016. The centrist approach of Pete appeals to Republicans that fled the party after Trump.
Oh god, are the Russian trolls back out again?
Well, the trolls never left. But I don't see any reason to think this particular person was anything but what they seemed to be, a T_D poster.
I didn‚Äôt even see what was said before it got deleted, but your comment brought me back to 2016 and all that craziness. Not a good time and I hope we can deal with it better this time around.
Sen Warren: ‚ÄùIf you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'whiner.' And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?' I promise you this: I'll have a lot more to say on that subject later on."
I hope we get a book about her campaign
Holy fuck yes!!!!! Go off Warren!!!
Are we going to get a taste of NoFucksGiven Warren? Oh please oh please oh please let this be the case!!
Give. them. hell. :)
I watched her whole press conference. She's such an amazing person. I nearly teared up when she answered what it was like to see her name on the ballot.
She also showed enormous gratitude and class to her constituents despite her 3rd place finish.
Very happy to see this.
I will never forget how eye-opening the whole "Bernie doesn't think a woman can beat Trump" moment was. The amount of sexism was infuriating and the fact that it was coming from members of my own party was frustrating. She was viciously attacked by the same people who are asking for my support now in a very sexist manner and so was everyone who tried to defend her. They were out for blood without knowing anything about what actually went down between Bernie and Liz. They did everything in their power to bury her. And I blame Bernie too because he didn't even clarify anything about what he said and he didn't make any effort to condemn his rabid base. I can't wait to hear what she has to say about all that and I hope she doesn't spare anyone.  P.S: Spare me your "If you don't support Bernie now you never cared about progressive policies" BS. If you are incapable of waiting for more information before you start insulting women and calling them liars when they dared speak up against an old man, then you are not the kind of progressive I want to associate myself with. And learn how to treat your allies.
yessssssss I can‚Äôt wait for her to gives as few shits as Hillary does now.
It's far past time we had a woman in the White House :(
Spill the tea, Senator.  I hope she doesn‚Äôt endorse anyone. She owes no one!
Love this so much! And looking forward to her moving this issue forward!
I seriously don't get why Elizabeth Warren is always under a microscope while Biden & Bernie get the benefit of the doubt.
Can I love her any more?
Vote Nov!!! Keep the fight going, it‚Äôs not over. Warren is not throwing the towel, she is still trying anyway she can to keep fighting for the right thing.
That's our fighter. LFG.
I keep on finding articles which only have these short twitter length clips from her statement today instead of a complete video which I'd appreciate
Sing it, Liz. Democrats and progressives alike are not self-critical of their accidental bigotry.
I am so pissed I dont get to vote for her. My stupid state votes end of April.
She was judged by a different set of rules from the get-go and it was pretty damn clear why.
I've been recommending this lecture all day [https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6sguyx](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6sguyx)
Gurrrrrrrrrrrrl I so believe you!
I can't wait to hear her articulate it for us.    Followed by the entire sexist world denying and gaslighting.
It's amazing... I had an exchange very recently where my reply was  >Hillary having been the nominee, and winning the most votes, does not somehow mean that sexism magically doesn't exist; it's still affecting all of society at every level, so to claim it played no part in Warren's campaign (or Harris's, or Gillibrand's, or Williamson's, or Klobuchar's) is disingenuous.  >Sexism is an issue, period.
was there sexism against bloomberg? buttigieg? booker? at the end, there's only one winner and it's cutthroat. She made it to top 3, someone has to lose. She needs to stop whining.
Sexism from the voters. I don‚Äôt think any of the other candidates were sexist.

Most voters are women.... Most women did not vote for warren... Who are we angry at exactly? Why are women so loathe to vote for women is my question.
I want this too. And I cynically want it to have all the hot goss and everything she wanted to say about this shit primary that she couldn't say while campaigning.
I‚Äôve read all her books, they are great.
I would buy it in a heartbeat.
Oh my god yes. Get on this, Warren!
Yesss I need this.
Was Warren supporter, now Bernie. NoFucksGiven Warren is the one we needed the whole campaign. I think it came out too late.
I teared up as well. Her emotion was so sincere and she was so kind, without giving up her fighter attitude. She is wonderful and I will support whatever she does next.
Me too. She has inspired so many. I hope we see her again in 2024 or 2028.
I watched it too.  And cried.

The snake emojis were almost instantaneous. I believe her, because Bernie has said a lot of tone-deaf shit about gender and race, but my gut reaction wasn't to call him a liar and a *snake*. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and assumed there was some miscommunication. The sudden, intense negative reaction and sexist smears against Warren were maddening.  And, Bernie didn't bother demonstrably defending her until she dropped out, long past the point it would have meant anything.
That was a microcosm of the whole sexist environment we live in.  Down to the believing the man; condemning the woman; ruining her candidacy and her reputation over it; calling her a snake and a liar. How many women's words are not believed in this society?  Over everything from sexual discrimination, to sexual harassment?  How many women suffer the consequences if she dares to speak up?  And loses her career and sees her dreams crushed?  While men lose nothing?  Nothing, and I mean nothing, establishes without a doubt the toxic sexism in the Bernie camp than that moment.  Including their liberal use of the term "he said she said".  those are words used by men and the defenders of men to condone misconduct by claiming that women summarily lie, exaggerate and make things up for no reason.  I even had to explain this simple concept to my sister who purports to be a feminist, that it  isn't a woman's responsibility to explain a man's words; to put a man's words in context; to dig a man out of the hole his words put him in.  Women aren't responsible for men's words and men's behavior.  Bernie should have come clean and put it in context his own damn self.
The number of supposedly woke progressives who don't understand sexism is astonishing to me. I almost joined some of the Sanders subreddits after Super Tuesday just to get a feel for the support, and they're packed with so much blatantly sexist vitriol that now I'm questioning if it's even a campaign worth getting behind.
>"If you don't support Bernie now you never cared about progressive policies"  They never act like the bigger person even when they are winning.  They are always the victim in every situation because victims can never be in the wrong.   And if they're never wrong, then someone else must always take the blame.  And if someone has to take the blame, it might as well be the woman.  That's some cosmic-scale BS.
I saw nothing but hypocrisy and tribalism from Bernie supporters during that bout. I have a hard time believing the 180 taking place on that sub when nobody spoke out against their supporter's behavior then - especially S4P mods for taking no action to prevent brigading.  Looks like I'll be casting two lesser-of-two-evils votes this year.
That hurt me too. :( It made me realize that the "progressive" wing of the party was significantly less progressive than they claimed to be.   That and how eager a lot of northern white people are to speak for southern black folks.
My friends told me that it would be harder for a woman to win against Trump due to misogyny, so if Bernie did say that, he'd have been right. They were very offended when I suggested that they were ultimately enabling that same misogyny and sexism. "BuT It'S tRUe!!1!11!" Fuck them.
It's baffling to see but also perfectly reinforces the general environment that left leaning politics pretends isn't there.  She confronted him directly and his response was "I don't recall that."  And that was it. His supporters called her a liar and the general public acted like "well he said no so that's it I guess."
\^\^\^ This X 100!

Voting for the centrist isn't very progressive.
The shitty Bernie supporters suck. They do. But please keep in mind he has millions of supporters and can't police them all personally. He has denounced them over and over again. The internet is still a wild place and he appeals to young punks who both grew up online and have never engaged in politics before. Liz and Bernie have very similar goals, so I beg you not to write off his campaign, which aims to champion a lot of Liz's platform because some of his supporters are assholes. Even more of his supporters are hopeful, energized people looking to build a better world.

And I blame Bernie too because he didn't even clarify anything about what he said and he didn't make any effort to condemn his rabid base.  Honestly, both parties are to blame. They both refused to back down on their version of the conversation, which inevitably pit supporters against each other. It was a strategic mistake, that the two of them should have come to an agreement on.  The sexism that happened is inexcusable, but a lot of what was called sexism was just team politics. Believing one side over the other had more to do with who you supported than to do with your belief system.
Is it really sexist to think that other people are sexist? It's not saying a woman would lose through her own failings but the failing of others.

A snake emoji, while toxic, wasn't sexist in itself.  What's harmful to women is Biden supporting a federal ban on funding of abortions. Don't let toxic internet culture distract you from what's at stake here. The choice is clear to me.
My mom (61) was saying "I've lost hope that I'll see a woman president in my lifetime."  I (22) told her that I'm starting to wonder if *I* will. Feels like we've got another century to go at this point.  I am, though, encouraged that at least it seems like more women are *running* overall.
I'll give you a hint; it rhymes with "slexism"..
It's crazy how her "flaws" are fabricated and amplified, while Bernie shrugs off a heart attack, and Biden looks terrible every time he has a microphone at rallies and debates. And then every thread in here has some version of, "well her campaign wasn't flawless, so you can't say it was sexism".
RIP unity.  GG Trump, just had to sit back and watch us tear each other apart.
I will probably vote for her anyway if her name is printed on the ballot when my state votes in May. I'll vote for whoever it is in November, but I can't bring myself to vote for either of the remaining candidates in the primary.
My state votes 5 days from now. :/
Saving this, thanks for sharing!
Because in 275 years we‚Äôve never had a woman president and to some of us women, that really matters.
You'd be surprised to learn that multiple things can cause problems, and sexism is one of them.
No - she didn't say that.
Internalized misogyny.  If you grow up in a society with the media, the government, and even your own friends and family behaving as if you are lesser than your male counterparts, that will have a psychological effect.  It's not necessarily that they're looking at her and saying "She's a woman, she can't do it." It's more of just feeling like she can't do it without being able to explain why. Then other people give a reason and you justify it to yourself that that's your reasoning, even if you don't realize you're doing it.
I‚Äôm angry at a sexist and patriarchal society.   Sexism doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúew it‚Äôs a woman! I won‚Äôt vote for her!‚Äù  It can be ‚Äúhm will other people vote for her? I don‚Äôt want to waste my vote so I‚Äôll vote for a man‚Äù  And also just like..... media coverage and the way women have to be twice as good for half the recognition.   Also women can have internalized sexism.
Why would you expect women to vote for women because they're women?  Shouldn't you expect people to vote based on policy, character, etc., and not gender?

No fucks given Warren just tore down Bernie and his followers for their lies and bulleying against her and her supporters.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/06/elizabeth-warren-condemns-bullying-bernie-sanders-supporters/4972959002/  Hope you reconsider your support for him.
Rule 4 invalid now that Warren is out?
[removed]
It's hard to get onboard with people you agree with when you have to hold your nose at the things they have to say.   For all the progressiveness that camp boasts about, the followers of every single campaign that dropped out has a scarily similar story about getting harassed and abused that drove them away from someone they'd normally feel aligned with.
Warren specifically instructed the campaigners that she hired to treat others with respect and focus on the positivity of the Warren campaign, not on bringing down others.  Bernie meanwhile hired people who are confrontational and very unliked, like Briahna Joy Gray and David Sirota.  The vitriol is there because it starts at the top - if the guys he hired are like that, then of course it'll permeate through the ranks.  Warren would not stand for this, and neither should any of us.
If you accuse conservative men of sexist behavior, they'll usually brush it off.  They don't really care.  But when progressive men are called out for it, they can react in a much more hostile manner since they consider themselves one of the "good guys".   It's questioning their core identity, and when that happens, they can either introspect and examine their attitudes, or simply go the cognitive dissonance route and *dig in*.  And when the greater part of your so-called progressive online community is also digging in and reinforcing their own shared reality, it makes it that much easier.  And now, since you're one of the "good guys" and some woman is out their spreading lies, it's totally acceptable to post a bunch of snake emojis because you've convinced yourself that neither her nor her supporters are entitled to respect.  Cognitive dissonance is a hell of a drug.
It's so hard because we need them to advance the progressive agenda, but they're impossible to work with.
Hell, look at this same post on the politics sub. It‚Äôs all just claims that the results of her campaign had nothing to do with sexism.
Bernie is absolutely nothing like Trump, but his supporters and surrogates really seem to like using his playbook.
I just peaced out of a forum when I saw someone who was sad about Warren's departure being told to check their privilege.    You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means
All Bernie had to do was say "I did not intend to imply that, but if what I said was perceived that way I humbly apologize.  I will take this moment to reaffirm my commitment to gender equality in politics."    BAM!  Done!  Scandal over.  Bernie didn't say that because to just call her a liar was more politically beneficial.  **That** was the moment I knew I would never vote for Bernie in the Primary.  He will sacrifice anybody and everybody for the sake of his 'movement'.
Warren didnt leak it and repeatedly was like "yes this happened but we have more important things to focus on." My guess is that someone she knows leaked it thinking it would help her but Warren herself has only ever tried to distance herself from it while acknowledging the truth.
I understand that not all of his supporters are like that and I understand how you must feel right now, but I am not blaming only his supporters. He clearly knew he's benefitting from the whole thing so he kept quiet when he could have clarified what he said, what he meant, he and his campaign could have put a lot more effort into making it stop. He kept quiet. I can't describe to you how hurtful that was. I am used to dealing toxic people online, I argue with Trump supporters quiet often, but at the end of the day his silence was more hurtful than the vitriol of his base. I thought he'd be able to understand how damaging that is for women as a whole. I thought he's better than that.  I will support him if he is the one to win the primary but in this primary I am moving forward with the person who I think has the best character of those who are still left in the race.
Well, it looks like Biden has more supporters than Bernie and somehow I've never seen them behave like large swaths of Bernie's supporters do. Every candidate has shitty supporters, but no other democratic candidate has a base like Bernie's. Maybe it's worth asking why.
I mean where do you think their attitude comes from though? Bernie constantly rails about how everyone is against them and about how everything is some big conspiracy to defeat him. When that's what the candidate himself is saying, of course the supporters are going to be toxic. He can denounce it all he want, but he's the reason for the toxicity in the first place.
Love the Bernie people coming in to basically say #notallmen. It doesn't help.
As a woman it was very easy for me to believe that a man said something that he thought was a neutral observation but that I felt bad a whiff of sexism about it.
It's already been confirmed by the Intercept that Warren and her campaign did not leak the comment so you can strike "the timing was too calculated" from your comment.
1) If he was excited for her to run in 2016, why would he choose to run against her in 2020? Yes, obviously it's a different time, and that's the point--the conversation they had was whether a woman could beat Trump in 2020. To me, him choosing to run despite knowing she was shows he did actually believe that a woman wouldn't be able to beat Trump, or he would've just backed and endorsed her.      2) I have a hard time believing her campaign would release a story that seems very likely to backfire like it did; also, just having any sort of story like this raised automatically puts the idea in people's minds that a woman can't win, even if we're refuting it. That's how brains work.   &#x200B;  3) Her remarks about it before the debate were just confirming that the conversation had happened, not calling Bernie sexist. She actually tried not to talk about it. I believe the only reason she dug her heels in at the debate is BECAUSE he outright denied any such conversation had happened. It would have been easy for him to acknowledge he thought sexism would be at play in the election and use that moment to pivot to focusing on creating a society where less sexism exists; instead, he denied that he could have ever said anything wrong, and made it seem like she just outright lied.
You know he had every chance to clarify what he meant. He kept quiet. He let his base paint her as a liar and bury her so he could profit.
It is definitely sexist to be like, hmm i wonder what the worst parts of everyone else are gonna do so i can do it first.
We don't need people pontificating that other are sexist/racist, and then to use that excuse as to why we don't support those people. When that happens, you back them up and fight to make it happen regardless.   If you don't you're just enabling all the sexists/racists. Women and POC don't need us to be their saviors, they need us to be their partners.
Yeah *38 years* ago. When y'all point to stuff that he did decades ago, I don't think it's making the point you think it is. Just as the women at She the People who booed him for saying he marched with MLK
So before he called Planned Parenthood the establishment he was fighting against?  Good to see that even old guys can change their views!!
Here we go again. This is your evidence that Warren is a snake? Do you know that Harvey Weinstein considers himself a feminist?
So he marched around with a sign one day 38 years before he stood by while his supporters maligned her with the snake insults. That is the oldest, worst most fundamental symbol of misogyny against women and he cynically benefited from it. I will never ever forget it.
I mean..... calling a woman a snake definitely has some misogynistic undertones. It's ok to recognize that and still think that Bernie is a better candidate for women.
Pretty sure the democrats are united. Bernie just isn‚Äôt a Democrat and has never tried to help his natural allies if he can‚Äôt be in charge.
This is a super weird example, and I know there are better ones but just stay with me.  Consider the Arrowverse.  They're all hokey, poorly written, TV shows, but consistently Batwoman and Supergirl (and surprise surprise Black Lightning) get absolutely dog piled on.  If you point out that their RT scores are the result of misogyny people will say, "No, the show is hokey and poorly written stop blaming sexism for everything!" okay well so is The Flash, Arrow or Legends of Tomorrow.  But if you don't have a white dude as the lead, you get a disproportionate amount of hate for every perceived flaw.  Two things can be true.  It's possible that Warren didn't run a completely perfect-in-every-way-campaign, *AND* she needed to, but couldn't, overcome a mountain of misogyny from the left and the right because every misstep was a chance to pounce.  No one runs a perfect campaign.  Bernie had a heart attack, and Biden angrily yelled at voters in town halls and had one okay debate performance and a bunch of other goose eggs.  But at the end of the day, the most prepared candidate, the intellectual leader of the democratic party, the hardest working person in politics lost to two spectacularly flawed old white men because voters ran to their safe embrace.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: "Elijah Cummings is one of my dearest friends. He is a good man through and through, and he fights for what is just in this country. To be attacked by a President issuing racist tweets is beyond insulting, it is disgusting."
To be attacked by *this* president is rapidly becoming a badge of honor - gold star parents, war heroes, civil rights icons. I think people are clamoring to be lumped in with them by getting tweeted at.
Thank you Elizabeth.
Thank you for speaking up senator Warren!
I really hope she wins the democratic nomination and gets the chance to say these things to Trump's face in a debate.
The whole thing is a coverup for Jared Kushner "slumlord" properties in Baltimore.  Trump wants to bring attention to the area and get Cummings to start a "clean up" of the area so Kushner's properties will go up in value.

Maybe the president should stop punching down \*all the time\*.  Why does the most powerful man in the world feel the need to retaliate against every perceived slight? How small is he?
What does that have to do with the topic at hand?  If he said this to a white man he wouldn't be called racist because there's nothing racial about it.  Why do so many people inject racism into it just so they can "punch back" underhandedly?  You don't like him punching "down" on a senior congressman?  That's not a far punch down but whatever, call him out for punching down.  Call him out for what he's doing.  Crying racism just because the man is black is ridiculous and its part of why a lot of people voted for trump to begin with.  People like Bill Maher tried telling the left this and the left ignored those warnings and doubled down.  Lots of people tried to warn the left.  Like it or not anyone who engages in this helped get trump elected by pushing swing voters who were tired of these antics and the race baiting.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs racism because Cummings is black, it‚Äôs racism because of the way he talks about Baltimore. There‚Äôs unquestionably an implicit racism.  And the president can‚Äôt resist punching down against anyone, e.g. Khizr Khan (not sure if I‚Äôm spelling that correctly). He has no ability to stay above the fray that even the most modestly well adjusted adult has.  It should go to show you how unfit he is for this job.
Baltimore has *serious* problems with crime and poverty.  It's a fact.   "Ian Pannell reports from the city of Baltimore, where 25% of the population lives in poverty.  This report was first published in February 2017" -[From the BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCgqIN-6A20)  "What is your message to Donald Trump?"  "Come and help us.  Instead of critiquing us, come and help us. We need help, bad."  'Roaches, mice, epidemic of bed bugs, the neighborhoods are falling apart'  ---    > It should go to show you how unfit he is for this job.  I don't even think that most of his supporters think he's well tempered.  Again, that doesn't equate to racism.  All I'm saying is just call it what it is.
my home county is a place called Martin County and it's in Kentucky  the poverty rate there is a staggering 37%  above Martin County is Lawrence County, 30% poverty rate  below Martin County is Pike County, 23% poverty rate  to the west of Martin County is Johnson County, 27% poverty rate  other counties in the area:  Floyd County, 27% poverty  Clay County, 35% poverty  Letcher County, 27% poverty  Knott County, 31% poverty  Magoffin County, 37% poverty  Perry County, 29% poverty  Breathitt County, 33% poverty  Harlan County, 33% poverty  you know why Trump never goes after places like this where entire regions are ridiculously impoverished? it's white Republicans in those places, his base, he only attacks places he knows don't like him
> Republicans in those places, his base, he only attacks places he knows don't like him  Which isn't racist it's strategic politics.  I have no problem whatsoever with you pointing this out.  By all means, call trump out on this.  Call ALL politicians out on this stuff, I do.  So much of the left is so deep in it's bubble, and bubbles inside of bubbles, they can't look out or those bubbles will pop.  Being from Kentucky you have to know how shouting "RACIST" when there's no racism is only strengthening his base and pushing swing voters onto his side even if they don't love him.
strategic politics can, in fact, be racist  using racial animus to make strategic political moves is still racist  see also: Nixon's southern strategy
considering Democrats just racked up the largest midterm victory by percentage in the past hundred years I think telling racists they are racist hasn't had the effects you think it has  in 2016 independent voters swung towards Trump because he successfully painted himself as a moderate on things like LGBT issues and economic ones and now the independents are swinging the other way as it becomes clear he's a right-wing authoritarian  the suburban shift away from Republicans that begun in 2016 intensified in 2017 and 2018 and may well prove decisive in 2020
of course it can.  But we've gone back and forth about 5 or 6 times now and not only have you not shown the comment to be racist but you actually started with "i think the part that's racist is...".    If you're not even sure what's racist about the comment it's *probably* not racist.
Jeff Bezos called Bloomberg and asked him to run because he's scared of Elizabeth Warren.
I think ole Mike and Jeff could probably go in halfies on buying FoxNews if they wanted to do a good thing for the country.
What an ass.
Hey, can you do me a favor and become president real quick?
Maybe it‚Äôs just me but if I‚Äôm Warren I‚Äôm loving it. Takes votes away from Biden/Pete and provides the perfect punching bag. Defending M4A against Pete is one thing, defending it against Bloomberg will be a dunk contest.
I'm not convinced a real billionaire would be any better than the pretend billionaire we have right now. In fact, I think there shouldn't be ANY billionaires. When do we start eating them?
Maybe if Jeff Bezo's tried to run anything more than a giant scam that treats employees poorly and customers like idiots with a cloud service attached people would be more kind.   Companies like Amazon and Facebook are constructing their own demise by failing to look out for their workers, users and customers.
Good.
My MONEY MY MONEY OH MY GAWD MY MONEY!!!
Time to disable Amazon Prime.  I had been thinking about it anyway.    Fuck Bezos.
Why am I not surprised?
Even if she doesn‚Äôt win this thing...her getting the billionaires of this country to start pissing their pants and running scared has been a wonderfully entertaining development of this election cycle.
I ain't mad. The best Bloomberg can hope for is to play spoiler (to Biden and Mayor Pete).   Him winning would suck but I have no reason to think that will happen yet.
Yeah, that‚Äôs going to go over well with Democrats.  I‚Äôm fairly certain one of Seattle‚Äôs city council members just got re-elected on the basis of Bezos contributing an obscene sum of money against it.
I really don't think he's scared of her. If he was scared of her he'd just put unlimited $ into Joe Biden's new superpac. I think he just likes Mike Bloomberg.
... ug. Billionaires propping up billionaires.
And even more so Bernie Sanders.
Nobody's "scared" of Warren.
Said no republican ever. And I bet you bought something off Amazon at least once.
God and I thought I needed to get a life.  I can't wait to get off this playground
[deleted]
Why would they be afraid of Warren? She even tweeted out to Gates assuring him her plan was to work with them.   They are very much so more worried about Bernie. He‚Äôs explicitly stated there shouldn‚Äôt be billionaires.
Why? They already have Bloomberg News.
That would imply that either of them wants what is best for the country. Hah.
What on Earth makes you think they want to do a good thing for the country?!
If you get rid of Fox News another propaganda network will just pop up to replace it. It‚Äôs current viewers have a voracious appetite for bullshit
The problem with this idea is that it feeds into a narrative that billionaires will save us - they won't.  Ole Mike and Jeff aren't interested in advancing the working class progressive movement that has an opportunity to take the white house through Bernie or Warren, they only care about preserving their own wealth.  Besides, Fox News gives the Murdoch family incredible power - they would never be interested in surrendering that power.
Such a disingenuous presidential bid.

To be fair it is such a painfully slow death that it convinces a lot of people that it is actually growth. Welcome to the new normal.
lmao what? How is Amazon a "giant scam"?
Ok amazon has problems, but the worst jobs they have pay $15 an hour and provide full medical insurance  It‚Äôs not a giant scam
We dropped Amazon just after hearing about the warehouse death. I bought way too much content through them so I'm still stuck using their streaming for the content I have there. Content license portability should be more of a thing.
Just so you know, most of Amazon‚Äôs profit is from AWS (web services).
I cancelled mine after Amazon's shitty contractors  ruined my Halloween. Felt SO GOOD, especially because I was forced to wear just my normal clothes... I simply called my costume Amazon's Newest Hater.   I ordered a critical item 5 days early on one-day Prime, and it gets falsely marked 2 days in as Delivered when I'm *standing right there.* Don't lie to me! They make you wait 36 hours to report issues, and by then the re-order window was ruined, too.  It's surprisingly easy to order elsewhere, find items locally, and trade video accounts with friends if I want to watch Man in the High Castle.
Bernie Sanders is not the candidate billionaires have been going on TV to cry about. They're evidently more afraid of Elizabeth Warren.
[removed]
Bullshit.  Stop trying to pit Team Sanders against Team Warren.  The billionaires don‚Äôt like either candidate.   We may have different preferred candidates, but we‚Äôre ultimately on the same team.  The people united can never be defeated.
No, it's because she's leading in the polls. Bernie isn't.  If you think billionaires want Warren to win then you're delusional.
No, she told him not to worry, he'd still be rich.
Yeah, but Bloomberg News doesn't even close to make up for the damage that FOX does
And the Washington Post, kind of.
>Why? They already have Bloomberg News.  Buy and fix Fox News. Toss out the fux. Add lots of fax.
Are you nuts eliminating Fox would be a huge blow to the far right propaganda machine.  But it is also a first step.
It is the "In case of emergency, break glass" candidacy. If Joe Bidden falls off the cliff jump in and make sure Warren or Bernie don't win.  He already said he is not going to campaign  in the first 4 states and isn't going to debate...not exactly a full court press, just waiting to see if they need to break the glass.
It's also not the first we've seen of this. Howard Schultz jumped into the presidential race not because of Trump but because AOC and her politics was gaining a lot of popularity and thought Bernie might actually win if his message succeeds in the Midwest.

Exactly. It's cutthroat capitalism working as intended. Nobody is being scammed here.
How would that not be the shippers fault in that instance?
We should do a Warren Prime fundraiser.   Cancel your Prime account and donate your Prime budget to her campaign.
They prefer Warren to Sanders. They are giving more attention to Warren because they prefer people support her over Sanders.
Removed rule 4.
[removed]
Agreed, nothing pisses me off more than the people from boths camps who bash the other. Warren or Sanders is our best bet, support them both, many other candidates are much more deserving of criticism than either of them.
It's also because she has a deeper understanding of law and economics as a scholar by trade.
Yeah that‚Äôs the problem. They‚Äôd still be obscenely wealthy under her plan, so why would they be scared of her over Sanders?
Is Washington Post sort of pushing a moderate democratic leader who won't touch billionaires? I haven't got too much of a read on their opinions other than that they are anti trump.
Murdock could just use the money to start another propaganda network
I would love to see fox go away but I think you‚Äôre underestimating how easily it would be replaced. Trump and other republicans would just constantly tell everyone to watch a different channel.   Right now people on the right trust fox. If they stopped trusting in them they would find something else.  Also just to put it in perspective the most viewed show on Fox only gets about 3 millions viewers. That means the vast majority of republicans don‚Äôt watch it
I like Warren. She more to the left than I would prefer long term, but we need a hard swing to the left after 40 years of hard right and moderates.
Once Bidden, twice shy.
Completely agree. That might be the only way to collectively save our planet at this point. It sounds cheesy and unreal but that is the reality of the situation. We need massive structural change *now* so we can turn this ship around before the tide starts to creep in.
Depending on where you live, Amazon is the shipper.
This was an amazon direct contractor for delivery.  I get it; people love their Amazon prime, so I won't delete my comment. I just live in an area serviced by very poorly rated shippers, and Amazon doesn't really offer any choice in the matter. The tracking code was serviced by Amazon directly.
> They are giving more attention to Warren because they prefer people support her over Sanders.  Riiiiiight. That interpretation is completely logical and not the least bit loony.
Removed for Rule 3.
That's exactly what I'm doing now. Donating to both campaigns.
They will still be wealthy with Bernie too.
No kidding, read [this article from today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/11/09/americas-billionaires-take-center-stage-national-politics-colliding-with-populist-democrats/). They always refer to Warren and Bernie as "the liberal wing of the Democratic party," as if everything to the left of center is "liberal" and the further left you go, the liberaler it gets.   When they're not doing that, they're calling us "populists," which is just a demeaning term the establishment uses to refer to popular candidates that challenge the status quo. It's like a dog whistle for centrists.   But bigger than that, the whole article is written as if the billionaires are the victims. Just look at the tone of this paragraph:   > The populist onslaught has ensnared Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, led to billionaire hand-wringing on cable news, and sparked a panicked discussion among wealthy Americans and their financial advisers about how to prepare for a White House controlled by populist Democrats.  It's not even from the opinion section. This is a news article.
The Post op-ed section has become a daily screed against Warren. I have to stop at times and wonder if I've accidentally pulled up Breitbart.
WaPo is trash. It used to not be trash but then a greedy billionaire bought it and turned it into a click bait opinion dumpster fire.
Fox is carefully and skillfully crafted.  It's not so easy to create a new one.  It won't have the same reach or retention.
Exactly so clearly, they would be far more scared of a candidate that believes billionaires shouldn‚Äôt exist than one that believes in capitalism ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù one with billions, and that‚Äôs the point.
I never understood how "populist" became a derogatory term. I mean, wtf is wrong with holding popular positions? Doing what the people want is literally the job of politicians in a democracy.
Their best editors and journos jumped ship to create Vox in 2013, Ezra Klein and The Weeds podcasts' coverage has been excellent IMO.
The same employees could just go to the new one. If you have a restaurant and I buy it but then all the staff goes to a different restaurant what did I buy?
To me, populism is defined more by the style of messaging. Pitting groups against one another to rally supporters.
I love listening to Today Explained!
I assume they are all under contract.
It's also a necessary tool for unifying the lower and middle classes. The upper echelons of society have always been much more politically coherent relative to the working and middle classes.  They own the 3 media conglomerates, and they divide and conquer to preserve the status quo.
That‚Äôs true but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if selling the channel breaks their contract.
Elizabeth Warren reading the names of trans women of color killed in 2019 at the #LGBTQ forum made me tear up
God, the names just kept coming.
If there was any doubt she‚Äôs my candidate, it‚Äôs gone now. I‚Äôm a trans woman, and the policies put in place by the current administration have scared me out of pursuing transition.   I need Elizabeth to win. I‚Äôm tired of being frightened and feeling like an enemy in my own country.
One of my favorite local performers, a trans woman, was attacked this last weekend. Grateful it wasn't worse. Because listening to this list, it feels endless. :(
Wow. What the hell? I had no idea it was this bad.
God bless her for doing this. I pray that this finally starts bringing this problem the attention it needs to be solved.
I was floored when I heard her read out those names and declared that they deserve to be said. That shows some real initiative, doing that instead of listing off xyz like the other candidates.
My best friend is a trans woman. I am so often scared for her.
This was so powerful.

I am rooting for you. Let's get Warren into the Whitehouse and make up all the ground we lost under Trump, then forge even farther.  Nobody should feel like an enemy in their own country. Let's fix that together.
Yeah, just read about her and I'm glad she's okay.   The attack was so close to where I work and play.  I don't think of that shit when I'm downtown bar hopping, talking to randos without fear; then something like that happens and it's such a wake up call to me that I'm a target to so many deranged bigots out there.  Yet it doesn't change my behavior.  It can't.  I'd rather die than have to live through that filter again.  We just have to make it stop.
It‚Äôs also important to note that 18 of these women were Black.
We are at 19, maybe 20 now in the US this year. But this is an ongoing global problem and every November there is an international transgender day of remembrance where local communities come together to memorialize and, in some respects, protest the murders of the prior year.
Your comment has been removed.  Don't "All Lives Matter" a topic about trans women being murdered.
I don't see her as a co-sponsor https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1693/cosponsors?q=%7B%22party%22%3A%22Democratic%22%7D
She is no longer co-sponsoring it. I thought that legislation died a while back.
Comes across as concern trolling, tbh.
It's true.  It endangers countless women (mostly marginalized ones) without helping anybody.  In fact it took law enforcement's strongest ally (sex workers who witness trafficking) and made the lives of many much more dangerous and difficult instead of cooperating.  That bill was literally the opposite of what we needed to combat sex trafficking.
I love you. For this post and a million other reasons. Stay fierce, stay safe. üñ§!
That's because (according to his post history) he's an Andrew Yang supporter who says that Donald Trump is his second choice for president. He's definitely here to concern troll.
Awww, thanks for the love.  I probably love you too, lol. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Elizabeth Warren Is Winning Over Left-Wing Hearts In Iowa
I really hope Biden's pace will slow, or that he may change his mind on the presidency.  Give the spotlight to Eli instead
Can confirm. Am Iowan. I like a lot of candidates and still go out to see people when they come to town, but Warren has me won over already.
It's amazing to see Warren gaining such strong traction. I've always liked her, but felt even just a few months ago that there was no possible way for a progressive woman to ever sniff the nomination. It now seems quite possible, and that is promising. She's a genuine person with great ideas to move the country forward. She's already won my support.
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   Caucus: February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
Honk honk
I‚Äôm concerned with her relationship with the military industrial complex and willingness to take big money in the general.
I'm pretty sure it is slowing...and will continue to do so every time he opens his mouth.
A minute on [joebiden.info](https://joebiden.info/) should do it.
It's unlikely Warren will win in Iowa, but a second place finish ahead of Bernie would be a shocker. That's what I'm hoping for. It'll give her some early momentum.
goes back to 2016 - not sure who's being polled and consistently going to Biden or why.   a lot of these early numbers are inflated by PACs and lobbyists they put their money behind to influence donors
Can you please elaborate? I'm not sure what you're referring to.
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/  Eh. Warren's been creeping up, but it looks like even with Biden's bump settling he's still far a head.
That site is ludicrous.
I can't believe he's calling himself uncle Joe  the ultimate cringe  edit; too drunk to realize that was a parody ignore me
In her home state she‚Äôs pretty close with military contractors and has said she will be taking big money in the general election should she win the primary. Downvote all you want but it‚Äôs still facts. I like warren overall and she‚Äôs right behind sanders to me.
We're a year off, give it time.
It's an attack site not Joe Biden's campaign page.
Sources?
For real.  This time 2007 hardly anyone knew the name Obama.
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/  However I'm hopefully that given Warren's standing half a year from now she could be one of the four remaining candidates. Then I think she'd shine, but I'm worried with a field so big.
Exactly, so much can happen
Exactly. At this point 4 years ago, Jeb! was the leading candidate.
yes, i got that now lmao
Here is Warren's interview on TYT where she said she'd take big money in the general election: https://twitter.com/TheYoungTurks/status/1100190585330323457  She has voted twice to increase Trump's military budget. https://www.leftvoice.org/elizabeth-warren-votes-for-massive-increase-of-war-budget
I‚Äôm at work and can reply briefly in between stuff but the interview was on the young Turks when she said it and her history in mass can be googled real quick which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve already done since asking me.
Jeb was the leading republican candidate in 2015
The big field is going to begin dwindling soon enough, considering the threshold for qualifying for the debates will get higher each time. All the idiots on their ego runs will be forced to drop out sooner or later, they won't be able to sustain this for much longer.
Yeah because Trump hadn't declared. Trump declared June 16th 2015. Trump was in the lead pretty early on. Two weeks after declaring he was on top of about half the polls. One month after declaring he was on top non stop (minus a Carson blip in the fall).  Source: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/
How many times has Bernie Sanders voted to increase the military‚Äôs budget over the course of his career?
He never led the polls he was just an establishment favorite
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/national-primary-polls/republican/  Trump was in the lead pretty early on. Two weeks after declaring he was on top of about half the polls. One month after declaring he was on top non stop (minus a Carson blip in the fall).
I am not sure, but I would like to know. Bernie is definitely not as anti-imperialist as I would like. He did, however, vote "No" on all three of Trump's military budgets.
Not in June
I mean he didn't declare until half way through June. Within two weeks he was popping up at the top and by one month he was constantly on the top. By mid July he would never leave the top save for two polls favoring Carson in the fall.
Jeb was already losing in about half the polls in June. Even before Trump declared, Carson and Rubio were beating him at times. Even Walker I think.
I'm voting for any Democrat that wins the ticket, but Warren is slowly becoming my favorite. Her policy is on point.
Warren is right - we can't wait around for a year and half. We are losing the actual republic daily. Barr will order every Justice employee including Mueller (still on the payroll) not to testify to Congress.   We therefore have no rule of law. We know the Senate won't impeach but uh.... isn't there some value to forcing the Republicans to fight an impeachment battle?   Let's get in their faces. Let's sue the administration over subpoenas, double down on the emoluments lawsuits, and draft articles of impeachment - he's committed offenses that have nothing to do with Russia that should have him booted from office. Force them to fight on several fronts.
Same. Her corruption policies would go a long way in addressing the actual issues in this country (outside of the fundamental problems within the constitution).
i'm so sick of squishy middle-wayers.   rock on @ElizabethWarren!
I think the early support for Biden is less about Biden and more about how committed people are to beating Trump.   Advocating for your favorite and uniting behind the eventual winner shouldn't/can't be mutually exclusive.
I was a big Bernie supporter. But before that, I wanted Warren to run. I've been a fanboy since I watched her lecture "The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class." Well worth an hour if you have time.
This is where I'm at right now as well. Looking strictly at policy and leadership, Warren is way out front. There's other factors to think over and a long time before the primaries kick off, but Warren is the most consequential progressive in D.C. by a wide margin.   I'm still undecided, but back after the 2016 election, Warren 2020 was sort of the dream scenario, and it's kind of bonkers that she's not polling higher.
Even if it's Biden. Vote blue, no matter who.  Personally I'm the same, Warren and Bernie are my front-runners.
Honestly, if Jeb Bush ran as a Democrat, and somehow every Democratic voter got brain damage and he won the primary, he'd have my vote.  But I'm in the exact same boat as you.  I love Warren; she is an inspiration, and I think she has good ideas and great intentions.
Donte to her campaign please
My thoughts exactly.
I'm voting either Warren or bernie, whoever is leading when I vote cause I want one of them to win
Not sure I understand why you said "but" in your title, though I like your thinking!
If I was an optimist I would say Gravel, but since I'm not I would be equally happy with either Warren or Sanders
I am hoping warren stays as a senate where she can actually write the law, but if it is down to biden or sanders....i would much rather have liz as my president
This is how I feel -  If we don't impeach within the month of May (I want to say this week, but I'll be resonable) I have lost complete faith in the system.  *this* is why we voted in the blue wave. The democrats not doing anything and kinda sitting on their hands will result in the same thing that happened in 2016.   I don't care if nots popular atm, I don't care if the senate wont do jack shit. Impeach.
I think I'm still going to vote Sanders, but honestly I'd support a Warren/Sanders ticket over a Sanders/Warren ticket anymore.  Sanders has the superior long-term view for the country, but Warren is close and has the superior short-term view of the country.  It's a little disappointing how Sanders isn't concerned with the fact that we're losing this country to corruption, and equally so as refreshing that Warren is willing to come out so strongly on the issue.
I‚Äôm a legit, unironic centrist. Elizabeth Warren is my preferred candidate. We need someone pulling from a leftward position to bring this country back to the center.
Biden support is from middle age and older democrats. They can‚Äôt get on board with the ‚Äúcrazy youngins‚Äù. If you ask them questions without buzzwords, they tend to agree with the ‚Äúcrazy youngins‚Äù. Warren/Bernie are very polarizing. Warren‚Äôs policy‚Äôs can‚Äôt be beat. They‚Äôre well thought out and are possible, not just some pipe dream. Unfortunately a lot of people do not vote based on policy.
This early on the support viewed in polls is really off name recognition.
Even if it's Tulsi, I'd vote blue over Trump.
jeb!
I'm trying to think of someone worse than Trump, and I'm having a hard time. Roy Moore from Alabama? I guess a hardcore religious fundamentalist while be worse for our country.  It's scary to think about...
I rewrote my title a few times, it's left over!
Who do you want to win then?
So from a strategy perspective, I think of it this way:  Pelosi is somewhat slow rolling it for the point of maximum damage to Trump.  The goal of which is to either get enough evidence that Republicans either have no choice but to convict him in the senate or they have to go into 2020 with having gone on record of voting to acquit a criminal president.  The longer its drawn out, the more damage it does to the GOP who are propping him up.  That makes flipping the Senate next year all the more possible.  She probably will begin impeachment hearings eventually but it doesn't help the cause to have impeachment fail in the senate just yet.  Impeachment hearings starting in the fall is my prediction.
Sorry for the questions, you're the only centrist I've met in months who is not right wing in disguise.
Centrist according to what axis? Are you a socialist or a capitalist?
Neat!
Idk yet.  Prolly gonna make up mind by dnc debate...  Bu my preference is with either warren or buttigieg as of now
\^this! Pelosi has been in the ~~Senate~~ House too long not to be strategic with this. I'll be extremely disappointed if impeachment proceedings don't begin in 2019 though. It will screw the Republic over in 2020.  &#x200B;  edit: thanks stranger.
Hey. What happened the last time conviction failed? Oh... That's right. Republicans gained full control of the government.  Edit: changed impeachment to conviction
Yeah, I don't fault Pelosi for taking this route, as it makes a lot of sense. But Warren is right that it's an ethical issue, and ethics shouldn't wait because of strategy. As long as Trump is out at dinner point and is eventually heels responsible for some of his crimes, I'm fine with either outcome.
I think of the strategy this way: Trump supporters are blind to anything that doesn't support their point of view.  If the House impeaches and the Senate acquits, Trump now has a huge point that he was exonerated, that the system tested him and he came out on top.  To the people who don't follow politics closely, that is a huge win for MAGA, and Democrats don't want to give him that opportunity.
I encourage people to donate to Shahid Buttar. I just chipped in $25. He is running against Pelosi in the 2020 election. We need leaders with moral clarity and Pelosi has shown time and time again she doesn't have it. She, like most of the old guard Democrats, are stuck in the 90s era political theater while the world has changed around them. She needs to go.
It‚Äôs all good, no one uses political labels consistently anymore. I‚Äôm an economic centrist. I believe in free market capitalism combined with robust public institutions, social welfare, and regulations. All of the great welfare programs they have in Western Europe are financed by thriving capitalist markets. It creates a positive feedback loop where large tax revenues get reinvested in the public which in turn is highly productive.
It's worth remembering that "the center" in the US is much further to the right than it is in the rest of the developed world.  I also consider myself a centrist by international standards, but in American politics that means that I want to move to the left.  We're the only nation where universal healthcare is actually considered controversial, for example.  The notion that "freedom" includes families going broke because they can't pay their medical bills would be considered laughably extremist (not to mention immoral) in literally every single other advanced democracy in the world.
To be clear, Pelosi is in the House, not the senate.
Just to be clear, I'm not saying we shouldn't because it may fail. It should be done regardless and I love Liz for being at the vanguard of this.  I do however think people should expect it to not be instantaneous and not be frustrated by the slow burn. Pelosi wants it to be as clear cut a case as possible so that not only the less safe districts can be confident their vote to impeach won't hurt them, but it can be used against Republican house members that vote against it so we can get an even bigger wave in 2020.
Which actually, in the long term, creates even more revenue for all companies involved.  If America is so hell-bent on getting money to the rich guys, then why the hell not do it while also making the bottom layer a tad more richer, it's the lesser of all evils to me.  (Or we could just convince big companies that sitting on money, and only hoarding it, is bad. But I like to dream)
I didn't think you were. I do apologize for the snarkiness of the comment. I'm just getting fed up with this junk about the Democrats getting burned if an impeachment conviction fails. Plus, the process really shouldn't be like a 20 minute thing. The trial should go on for months and it isn't like these stories won't continue to come out.   I am starting to take notice of Warren. She isn't afraid to speak her mind and she made some pointed comments about her generation which took me by surprise.   You have more faith in the Speaker of the House than I. Pretty sure she was speaker when it came out about the lies over weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. She didn't go after a Bush for that. I seriously doubt she'll impeach now. Her recent comments are discouraging to say the least and not impeaching him will only encourage him to continue.
Warren defends wealth tax: 'I'm tired of freeloading billionaires'
This was my favorite line from the debate.
I just bought the "Billionaire Tears Mug", with my birthday money. We'll see how long it lasts in my parents republican household.
2 cents! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnNbJ6-fiR8
I haven't built out a Christmas list yet, but my mum always asks, even into adulthood, so heck-- billionaire tears mug.
#I'm so glad Warren has made our supporters class conscious; class consciousness is vital in defeating billionaires
[deleted]
Why did she say 50 billion? Isn't it 50 million? Has anyone corrected this?
I can hear your dad "Oh, I see it's empty".
I want that. But, since Florida did not accept the Medicaid expansion, I'm stuck paying out the ass for copays.
I like the energy. But I gotta say. Tad bit cringy lolol
The billionaires can wipe their tears with their billions. I'm not going to lose sleep over people insulting the concept of billionaires.
The top 1% control more wealth than the lower 90% in this country, and they‚Äôre using every dirty tactic available to keep it that way. That‚Äôs why it makes sense.
Industrialization and the technological revolution have created economies of scale the last century bringing substantial positive innovations to society and our individual lives. This automation has done wonders, but economically and policy wise we haven't caught up.   Human labor capital (intelligence, physicality, work ethic) are all finite. Nobody except god (or whoever your higher power is) deserves the equivalent resources that a billion dollars or more gets you. Some economic inequality is essential, but our current obscene economic inequality has roots in everything from poverty, education, politics/campaign contributions, and the fundamental pillars of democracy and individual voting power. This basic premise is more "capitalist" than our current state of affairs.
Most people don't like billionaires.  The billionaire tears mug was instantly one of the best selling items in her entire store and the stories about billionaires hating her are basically boosting her campaign.  Every time they go on TV to complain is free advertising.
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone correct it but It was just a slip, because right after she said ‚Äúand then once you make a billion, pitch in a few cents more.
I noticed this too - surprised you're the first one I see mentioning it.

No, you really don't.
New statements from Warren re: Soleimani
"We're not here by accident."  This is so important to remember.  If we can elect the right leader in 2020, then America won't have to be in another unnecessary war.  Of all the thousand reasons to get out the vote, this could be the biggest.  I'm trying to remember the quote from Iron Jawed Angels, "Nothing is as important as stopping a war."
Bad Bernie supporters are raking her over the coals for the statement from last night and she's already being labelled as a war-enabler for it. In what world? It always seems like the two candidates are fairly in-line with each other and the differences are just syntax.
Wag the Dog...  The Idiot's favorite movie.
Senator Warren touched on my first thought when I heard all this; how did we go from a nuclear deal that was working to where we are at now?  "The facts are clear: The Iran nuclear agreement is working as intended," Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the moderate pro-Israel group J Street, said in a statement on Oct. 6 (2017). "**The president is acting based on his own personal political agenda, distaste for diplomacy, and contempt for his predecessor**. Congress should see this decision for what it is: a reckless mistake that makes it harder, not easier, to confront Iran and prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons."  [https://www.npr.org/2017/10/13/556664338/trump-to-put-iran-nuclear-deal-in-limbo-by-refusing-to-certify](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/13/556664338/trump-to-put-iran-nuclear-deal-in-limbo-by-refusing-to-certify[/url])

That's it for me folks. Apparently the rule of thumb is to let embassies get overrun and allow people to be killed like Benghazi. Downvote away. Unsubbing anyway.
The whole point is a war to win an election. And if he loses he hands off a disaster to the dems. Glad she is speaking out.
What are they taking issue with?
I like Bernie and Warren.  Following the Republican narrative that this was a bad guy instead of pointing out that this guy fought ISIS was a mistake.
It's a partisan attack from the Chapo types. Read the statements the people from that podcast have made, they are openly and gleefully acting in bad faith and mock anyone with the idea of discussing things in good faith as "civility nerds."  &#x200B;  We need to push back on their narratives but talking directly to them is a waste of time.
They'll do anything to push their cult leader regardless of the intellectual dishonesty and harm to the party.   It will end up electing Biden because Bernie has been stagnant since the beginning and they've torn down everyone else, alienating their supporters in the process.
Uhhhh yes. At the very least they are friends. Maybe what your picking up is just the natural static tension of this whole debacle. People choose. Intentions, though, are not always kind.
Do yourself a favor and don't read Twitter comments. Or Politico comments. Or YouTube comments...
Lol
Were you tho? Because she's always been against war with Iran and warning of what Trump is trying to do  06/20/19  ["It's not enough to say that we don't want conflict‚Äîwe must make one less likely. Congress must make clear that war with Iran is not authorized. We should work with our allies to deescalate tensions and create space for diplomacy. We can't afford another forever war."](https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1142123488750264320)
Removed for Rule 1 (Trolling)

>instead, she should show that she understands the other side's position and emotions, even if she disagrees, since, as President, she'll be responsible for all Americans.  Show me *one time* Trump did that.  Go ahead.  One tweet.  One rally.  One loud, disjointed "interview" in front of his helicopter.  One instance where Trump "understands the other side's position and emotions, even if he disagrees since, as President, he's responsible for all Americans".
Trump needs admitted to a psychiatric hospital for the worlds own good. Not disappointed with Mrs Warren at all.
Totally disagree. Drawing contrasts, especially on this terrible decision, is what our politics is about.

There‚Äôs a big difference between protecting embassies and assassinating another country‚Äôs military leaders. I hope you can see that
>  Apparently the rule of thumb is to let embassies get overrun and allow people to be killed like Benghazi.  Where does she suggest they get overrun? Do you think the only options are pre-emptive strikes that could start another war or letting embassies get overrun?   And do you know *Why* Benghazi happened? Because the *Republican-controlled congress at the time refused to provide more security*.  Why do you think Clinton withstood 11 straight hours of testimony and walked away?   **Because that blood was on GOP hands.**  You previously stated you've left the Republican party and maybe it'll take awhile to re-adjust your views but, to be clear, Democrats are *nuanced*. You aren't going to get black-and-white decisions or statements b/c issues are complicated and we tend not to talk in absolutes.  No-one is suggesting we let embassies get attacked; **no-one**.  I'm not gonna downvote you but if you want to really engage in a political discussion there need to be established facts; suggesting Warren--or any Dem--is saying "let our embassies get overrun" is patently not true.
 It is a sad day indeed, for one of our own has decided to leave us. Let's honor BrokeButNotDefeated with a stroll down memory lane. The following links will lead you to /u/BrokeButNotDefeated's MVP moments in /r/ElizabethWarren.     __Top Submissions__  + [You had me at extending the solvency of social security for two decades.](http://np.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/d3pdwo/you_had_me_at_extending_the_solvency_of_social/)     If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads
Try to not let the downvotes and criticism persuade you to another candidate. People here care very passionately about Warren, to a bit of a fault at times.  Take this as a Warren supporter who regularly gets downvoted here. It's ok to not agree with everything she does, and still think she is the best candidate on the field. It's also very ok to not agree with the supporters, they aren't representatives of the candidate, anymore than you are.
The first part of her first statement, where she mentioned that Soleimani was a murderer. They say that her mentioning that is justifying Trump‚Äôs actions. Which is completely stupid in my opinion.
No, it's saying both can be true, and one does not follow from another. There are a lot of bad people in this world, many in positions of power. Doesn't mean we should lob a missile at them.
It isn't a narrative man, he was unquestionably a bad person. He may have been a useful ally against daesh but that doesn't suddenly absolve him of the things the Quds force did under his command.   *Americans* died because of actions he took. Muslims across the ME died because of decision he made. At some point it becomes calling a spade a spade and it is absolutely not a Republican talking point he was a bad person.  The actual Republican talking point is that killing him is going to prevent a war and was carried out to prevent the future death of Americans. That part is the spin, the bullshit. His being a bad person was not, and if we can't recognize that difference what in the literal fuck are we doing.
My problem with this is that she wasn't opposing the war on principle. The critiques about the importance of congressional authorization, cost, etc. are all about the "how" of war rather than the "what" of war. Arguing about the "how" will get us sucked into another Iraq or Vietnam. Warren comes around to a stronger statement in this post, but only after getting called out about it.
You not very good at this
Campaign Chair Deb Haaland would like a word with your uninformed ass.

It's a nuanced position, so of course the loudest Bernie supports can't understand it.
A lot of people like seeing things in black and white. Little do people know, you can have a negative view of someone, but that doesn't mean you wish for their death, especially in this way. I wish people could get out of that mindset. Not everything is black and white.
Well, yes. Attacking that is completely stupid because he *was* a murderer. Lol. It‚Äôs not like he was a perfect, upstanding citizen!
Ah yes. Let's go with that plan and get labeled terrorist sympathizers instead. That's a winning strategy for sure!
Bernie fails their purity test by voting for AUMF in 2001.  Barbara Lee is the only congressional rep who voted no. This is why purity tests don‚Äôt work.  Babs ain‚Äôt running
So, you wanted to her tack on, what, "war is hell" ? I don't see "principle" difference in the statements expect they were made after different events and different points of escalation. Bernie has had [the exact same grievances](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4547945/user-clip-bernie-sanders-expresses-concern-bombing-iraq-1998https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4547945/user-clip-bernie-sanders-expresses-concern-bombing-iraq-1998) in the face of the executive office making acts of war without congress approval.   This is not 2003, war is [extremely unpopular with Americans](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/03/killing-suleimani-iran-tension-trump-fault/). Nothing over the last decade has cured Americans war fatigue, Iran would have to do something really really stupid to rouse support for a ground war and invasion. No more endless wars *is* the argument against war for Americans. A big reason Trump got popular is people thought he was an anti-interventionist, he talked the talk before the generals put it in his head he could be a war hero.   Her principles lead her to introduce the bill for and be the first candidate to commit to no first use, and prioritizing diplomacy and re-building and diversifying the state department, and her discussions on war and conflict [have focused on the humanitarian toll and the damage the US does when it disregards that](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-national-security_n_4861778).
The "cost" of war is death.  People like you are deliberately misunderstanding a simple statement and holding her to standards you'd never apply to Bernie.
So tell me how pointing out the recklessness and the consequences of Trump's actions "breeding greater division"?  It's not like she's attacking his supporters, or the people who are pretty thrilled at the prospect of another war.  Why is it *always* the democrats who get criticized for "dividing the country", for "not reaching out" to "understand" the people they disagree with.  Meanwhile, as I've mentioned, you cant point out a single time Trump (or any republican, lately) did a single thing to unite the country.
It's difficult to believe you actually came to a Democratic candidate sub and are surprised that calling criticizing Trump "divisive" is downvoted.  The downvote feature is about "what people believe contributes to the discussion", and while this may be a sincere comment it's so beyond the bounds of expected discourse it's not surprising people think elevating it as a topic of discussion is worthwhile.  And a note, this is explicitly a "community for supporters of US Senator Elizabeth Warren", not a clearing house for critics to air their complaints.  We try to avoid creating an echo chamber (and we're not moderating your comment), but coming to the sub to try to pretend Democrats should treat Trump with respect after his actions throughout the last three years is never going to get traction and is not the purpose of this sub.
Bush was a murderer, obama was a murderer, trump is a murderer. It doesn't mean it's totally ok to assassinate them. That's why I don't like that people are calling him a murderer. It comes down to believing that killing americans is a serious crime while killing middle easterners is no big deal (or at most a regrettable necessity).
"He was no angel!"      Give me a break. This is the same rhetoric that got us into a war in Iraq because we just had to take down Saddam Hussein.
Going on twitter and shitposting about the high ranking official your government just assassinated does nothing but escalate things further and rationalize and legitimize this attack. It was a pretty bad response and should be rightly criticized.
You don't understand. Republicans ALREADY no matter what we say or do will call us socialists, terrorist-sympathizers, traitors, pinko commies, and any other derogatory thing they can think of. They called Obama all these things even as he was launching drone assassinations and killing Bin Laden.  It isn't a good rhetorical strategy to craft language in an attempt to stave off these kinds of inevitable attacks. We need to be firm and unequivocally opposed to their nonsense. There is no plan you can concoct that will result in the GOP not accusing Democrats of these things.  It's not that I don't get nuance. It's just that there is simply no need to further strengthen the argument that there was any legitimacy to this attack whatsoever. Even in subtle ways.

> And a note, this is explicitly a "community for supporters of US Senator Elizabeth Warren", not a clearing house for critics to air their complaints.  Yes, and some of her supporters, like myself and two other commentators, are very disappointed by the path she has been heading down. If she wants to win the election, this type of rhetoric is not going to cut it. With the rhetoric used here, she is obviously trying to win over Democrat supporters while alienating those of us who respect the President of the United States.
Soleimani 'murdered' Iranians and civilians in other middle eastern countries too. He was a terrifying force in the region if you weren't on his side.  The Iranian/ME diaspora isn't shedding tears for him from what I see. But that's not condoning what the US/Trump did.

Recognizing that murderers are bad is a fair response
Oh for fucks sake, here too?   The guy was the commander of the fucking Quds forces. If you think saying that he was bad somehow means she supports his assassination then you seriously need to rethink your positions.
1. You comparing Warren putting out a public statement to "shitposting". Proof that Twitter has completely ruined any form of discourse.  2. What this guy did is not a state secret. It is on fucking Wikipedia. Say someone decides to google this guy knowing nothing about him and then asks Sanders about what he did. Is Sanders supposed to not respond at all? Lie? What exactly is your position here? The argument that this guy is a murderer is already out there. What purpose would ignoring it serve when people start asking about it?
You're mixing up Republicans and independents, republicans sure  think that, but right leaning independents don't think that at all.  Literally no one is making a play for the republican base.
No, you were criticizing Warren's remarks.  Please, explain how they were divisive.  Or can someone not point out reckless actions by the President, whom she will hopefully soon be running against, for fear of somehow offending someone?
>Yes, and some of her supporters, like myself.   Gonna stop you right there, because no, you're not. Takes like, two clicks to make that clear.  Just gotta click your name, see the post history, and boy is *that* fun.   > and two other commentators  Link those other two commentators? Sorry, It's not that I don't trust you, it's just that I think you're full of shit and a cursory glance at your comment history reinforces that.  And also I don't trust you.  >If she wants to win the election, this type of rhetoric is not going to cut it.  What type of rhetoric?" The kind that points out that Trump is full of shit?  That kind of rhetoric? The kind you called "divisive" because....ummm...mean, I guess?  >she is obviously trying to win over Democrat supporters  How dare she? Heavens forbid she tries to win over Democrats during the Democratic primaries.  So wild.  >while alienating those of us who respect the President of the United States.  Hmmm. All like 35% of the country, at this point.  I bet you really, *really* respected Obama, too.

I specifically said that being a murderer is not sufficient cause for assassinating someone.
And? I think it was clearly wrong of him to say this. Do you? And what do you think about Warren's statement?
sure, if you want to just help create excuse and legitimize the attack by oversimplifying a complex situation
how do you read everything i said and come to that conclusion? i just said it was a dumb thing to say
Right leaning independents aren‚Äôt going to vote for Warren. Stop caring about what anyone on the right thinks about anything. We need to care about rallying the left, and those who traditionally don‚Äôt vote. When you give a false narrative credence, even slightly, it makes it seem like it‚Äôs a valid position. No right wing positions are valid positions. They are wrong about everything one can possibly be wrong about, from morals to policy, understanding history, to understanding science. Altering the cultural soup they are swimming in will influence them over time. That‚Äôs done by absolutely dominating the cultural and media narratives around what is acceptable and what is just insane. And elections are won for the left by getting our folks out to vote.
>Please, explain how they were divisive.  \> Trump's actions put every service member and diplomat at risk.  No, Elizabeth, Iran's actions put every service member and diplomat at risk.  \> He's been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office.  No, Elizabeth, Iran has been marching toward war with US.  \> We're not here by accident. We're here because a reckless president...  Maybe she's referring to the President of Iran for the last one because, again, and I cannot stress this enough, it is Iran that is the enemy, not President Trump.  These three statements sow division.
[deleted]
Removed for trolling.  Selectively ignoring that the person you replied to said "that's not condoning what the US/Trump did" to act like they're in favor of assassination isn't trying to have a good faith discussion.
It seems like you're oversimplifying a complex situation, though.
Right, you'd rather say he was a nice man and that we shouldn't have assassinated him instead?  He was a piece of shit human being. We should not have assassinated him. We should not go to war with Iran.  These aren't mutually exclusive positions.
>  if you want to just help create excuse and legitimize the attack by oversimplifying a complex situation  This is a ridiculous take. You realize that nothing--*nothing*--a Democrat says or does will go without criticism from the Right, right?   So accepting that, who the fuck are we even talking about? Democrats who can't understand sentences making two distinct points?   The criticism of her statement is fucking stupid and anyone criticizing her for even acknowledging *who he was* (because if she hadn't, different critics would've said she was sympathizing with a murderer) is either a genuine idiot or completely disingenuous b/c they just want to attack her.
Become it wasn't a dumb thing to say, and I'm tired of people claiming that. He was a bad person. That's doesn't mean we should have killed him. Killing him shouldn't have even been on the table. Saying he is bad is just an accurate statement.
> And elections are won for the left by getting out our folks out to vote.  Please show me an election where this was true.
>No, Elizabeth, Iran's actions put every service member and diplomat at risk.  Are you pretending that this action will *not* increase the risk to our armed forces and diplomatic personnel already in the region, as well as the potential to start a somehow even worse war in the middle east? >No, Elizabeth, Iran has been marching toward war with US.  I like how you omitted the key part of that particular tweet.  In the very beginning of his term, Trump abandoned an agreement with Iran that was keeping them from becoming a nuclear power while also easing sanctions, improving our relations with Iran.  Here's the kicker: **Both our allies and our own intelligence services agree that Iran was abiding by the terms of that agreement.**  >Maybe she's referring to the President of Iran for the last one because, again, and I cannot stress this enough, it is Iran that is the enemy, not President Trump.  Relations with Iran were improving, such as they were.  They were certainly more stable.  Then Trump took over.  Trump started us on the path we're on.  Just so we're clear, your idea of "divisive" is "anything that might run contrary to what Trump says"?  Gosh, I wonder at all how anyone might run against him, since apparently pointing out anything is just so darn mean and divisive, huh?
I'll admit I came off a bit heated.  It tends to frustrate me when I get called divisive for having the audacity to question the god emperor or his party.  It's happened enough (not just from you) that I have a little patience for it. It came off ruder than I intended, and for that I apologize.  And you found one past comment....sort of supporting Warren?  I couldn't really square it with your initial comments, where you attacked her for rightly criticizing Trump's actions.  She's a candidate opposing him in an election.  Criticizing his policies is a big part of that.  So, what, you support both Warren and Trump?  How does that work?  The two are almost completely diametrically opposed.  He represents the very corruption Warren wants to eliminate.
[deleted]
by saying that all that does is play into the same talking points that are used to legitimize this attack? do you actually think it was wrong for the us to assassinate him, or do you think it just wasnt handled properly?   If your intentions are to condemn the attack and stop further escalations, how is calling him a murderer and terrorist going to help with anything?
its a dumb statement contextually and politically that has real consequences and all it does is further instigate the Iranians.
If a sex worker was killed by an undercover cop, could you see why people would be mad if the first thing you said was "she was obviously doing illegal work, but it's bad the cop killed her." Starting off the statement with victim blaming makes it pretty clear you might be okay with the outcome, but not okay with the method. The big outstanding question is whether Warren and others think not only was he bad and a murderer, but it's good that he was assassinated. And yes obviously he wasn't good and there's a reason people have been protesting the regime, but he should not have been droned. It matters how you respond. I was annoyed at Bernie for saying the war in Iraq was bad for being a waste of taxes and for killing our troops, as opposed to being bad for killing a hundred thousand to a million people and destabilizing countless more.
[deleted]
Turn that around, do you *not* think MBS is a horrible human being?  Does that mean you condone an assassination?  These sort of simplistic hot takes only work if no one actually thinks about them.  It basically comes down to a criticism of messaging rather than morality, and even then the idea that some hardline refusal to speak ill of the target would somehow percolate up into actionable change in political action is just silly.  Real hardcore stuff that totally warrants getting in a juvenile internet fight.
Listening to middle easterners is not "neocon" discussion points kid.   My post was in response to the "American lives" part. It erases the overwhelming majority of his victims. If you actually care about peoples of Middle East don't erase them and their pain from this situation.  Many are happy he's dead, but wish they had taken him out instead.
> by saying that all that does is play into the same talking points that are used to legitimize this attack? do you actually think it was wrong for the us to assassinate him, or do you think it just wasnt handled properly?  When you asked me before how I came to the conclusion from your initial comment, you know how I got there? Because this is the same nonsense argument Sanders supporters have been claiming on Twitter all day.  I think he was a bad person. I think we were wrong to assassinate him. If you can't call the leader of the Quds forces a bad person, then get the fuck out of political discussions. This is complete nonsense.   You can condemn the attack and call him a bad person. These aren't mutually exclusive positions, no matter how much you guys whine about it. Enough nonsense please.
So what should have she said instead? And also, aren't we supposed to be the honest party? The Republicans tell lie after lie. Are we supposed to say he was a good person? No. That's nonsense.
Criticizing Trump's actions is not the same thing as making him an enemy. Pointing out the bad things he does is only divisive rhetoric if you've linked your identity to Trump's poll numbers and the perception of whether or not he's a good president.  A very sad existence, indeed.   She hasn't, for example, said everyone who voted for Trump is a mouth-breathing troglodyte.  *That* would be divisive.  So also hasn't said that anyone who isn't voting for her is the enemy.  Trump can't say the same, can he?  Who's got divisive rhetoric, again?

New Poll Finds Majority of Americans Across Political Spectrum Back Warren's Ultra-Millionaire Tax

Ok I have two serious questions.   1.  Is the wealth tax constitutional?  2.  Could it ever get passed in Congress.   Full disclosure: Warren is my number 2 candidate. I like many of her ideas, but I am concerned if they will ever get passed in Congress. Please kind responses I am asking as a voter trying to become more informed, not as a troll.
We need to hammer the Wealth Tax and that  we are for taxing wealth and how it differs from an earned income
I think its better to be in second and 3rd place polling, Warren has started to receive less negative attention and has seen in the past few days positive coverage.
I love the idea in principle but have real concerns about the effectiveness of this tax in practise. Yang's VAT seems more practical and effective. I love Warren, and would love to hear some official response to critisms/concerns suround a wealth tax beyond a mug for billionaire tears.
Why is a wealth tax better than a VAT?
Unless you vote in a caucus.
Did you mention that Trump's original wealth tax was even more steep? I changed some minds with that info. Tucker Carlson of all people was claiming she stole TRUMP'S idea. Shameless.
Removed for Rule 4.
1. It is 100% constitutional. The Founders of this country were all for a wealth tax. It‚Äôs just not as obvious now because the definition of taxable wealth is much more broad than it was a few centuries ago. The American Bar Association (https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/publications/abataxtimes_home/19aug/19aug-pp-johnson-a-wealth-tax-is-constitutional/) does a very good job of explaining this. 2. Please look at https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/business/economy/economy-politics-survey.amp.html A sizable majority of Republicans support a wealth tax. The vast majority of independents and Democrats support a wealth tax. This is not an isolated poll‚Äî there is no credible survey or poll that has ever found in the last year that he majority of America and the majority of either party has opposed a wealth tax.  I wanna stress that Warren has more popularity than it seems. In the Rust Belt (Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania) especially (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/elizabeth-warren-surpasses-joe-biden-key-2020-states-1470473%3famp=1), people want a candidate who is very pro labor and pro working class. I genuinely think she can win those states, and probably Florida as well. She also has some shocking appeal to a few Republicans who may not want Medicare for All but want her anti corruption bill passed and want a wealth tax and want social spending to go up, without ballooning the debt. So I think she can definitely beat Trump in the general election.  As for winning back the Senate and getting her agenda passed in Congress‚Äî here‚Äôs a very large difference between Obama and her (& Bernie). She and Bernie won‚Äôt drop their activism when they become President like Obama did (not hating on Obama, liked him a lot, but this is a clear contrast). That means maintaining campaigns of external pressure on the people on Congress to be held accountable and fight for the policies that have popular support.  Moreover, despite Pete and Joe portraying her as divisive, she actually has many bipartisan credentials. She‚Äôs worked with everyone (especially Republicans) from Ted Cruz to Lindsey Graham to Lisa Murkowksi to Many others to get her agenda signed into law. So I think that even with a Republican Senate, she could do a lot of good.  Although I honestly don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs an issue, because I think our chances of taking back the Senate are very good, especially with her as the nominee. She has the most favorability among the Democratic electorate, and is the unequivocal winner in terms of combined first and second choice of voters, and she genuinely fires up and can excite the base into turning out.
Why would it not be Constitutional? In the 1950s the highest tax rate was 98%, even if the 1% only ended up paying approximately 42%.   As for whether it will be passed, it largely depends on election results. Democrats could conceivably take the Senate, which would help out a lot. If Republicans keep control I imagine we'll see more of McConnell's legislative graveyard.
Please consider Liz for number 1.  I‚Äôd rather have her aspirational dreams and start from there than concede the middle and end up where we are.
A wealth tax is necessary but hard to implement. We had that here in Germany til 1997 and it caused a lot of trouble, though it worked more the less.   Wouldn¬¥t have a way higher taxation of capital gains a similar effect?
1. It depends on who's sitting on the Supreme Court.  My guess would be that if they were to find a legal framework to allow this, it would actually be based on precedent set by eminent domain (Seizure of land or property in the public interest), combined with taxation authority (Unlike traditional eminent domain, having no expectation of direct compensation). 2. It won't pass the Senate, in my view.  Even if the Democratic Party retakes control, there will be enough red and purple state moderate Democratic Senators who will likely feel this is a bridge too far and vote with the Republicans.  It stands a better chance in the House, but I am not sure whether the Speaker would want to force her colleagues to cast votes on something that could hurt them in the next election but which won't pass in the other chamber.  It may depend how heavily Warren leans on Pelosi, and, even then, Warren may want to consider whether or not this is how she wants to invest her political capital (Essentially, you can only push people so much on so many issues as President before you lose the halo given to you by winning an election), given it's poor chances of actually becoming a law and staying a law.
Oh yeah constitutional for sure, you just have to give the proceeds to the states on a per capita basis if I recall
While it is true that many of her ideas, and her plans would have a very flimsy time passing in the current congress - you have to ask yourself 2 questions:  1) do you want the person with the right ideas that might not happen, or the person with the wrong ideas that might happen?  2) this decision isn‚Äôt really about the plans themselves.  It is about the minds making the plans.  When some novel issue comes up - which mind do you want responding to that issue?  The one that comes up with good ideas, or the one that comes up with meh ideas?
I think your concerns can be allayed by taking a closer look at the plan (this sounds rude, but it's not meant to be, I just don't know else to say it lmao). Her plan isn't to just impose a new tax out of nowhere. She builds up to it. The first step is putting billions back into the IRS and reforming the way they act so that tax evasion can be cracked down on, rich people like Jeff Bezos won't pay literally ZERO taxes, etc. Collecting the money won't be an issue once it settles in, in my opinion. The issue really is avoiding the problems with the wealth taxes in Europe and how people get around those. Warren gets around those issues, and her plan is specifically informed by the failure of those wealth taxes. If a billionaire or ultramillionaire tries to renounce citizenship or the like to make their fortunes exempt, they pay an exit tax before they can go through with it, an exit tax which is extremely high.   Yang's VAT makes sense. But imposing and enforcing it isn't any less difficult than a wealth tax-- the difference is really how far we can go. Not hating on Yang (love him too), but his objections to a wealth tax are also about the practicality rather than rationality of it, and I believe either/both can be done without a large difference in enforcement between the two. Moreover, a wealth tax is immensely popular, and under a Warren administration, it won't be the Wall Street figures running the shots like they are now under Trump. Another huge reason why tax avoidance is increasing is largely because the current administration doesn't have the appetite to go after the wealthy, while hers definitely would.
Because the 16th amendment says the following:  "The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.  "  It doesn't give the Federal government explicit permission to tax wealth or property, only income.
I guess what I mean is a double taxation issue. These were income taxed previously. It‚Äôs an argument I have heard before.  I‚Äôm really not sure if it‚Äôs a constitutional issue vs just a law. So far I have been more in favor of eliminated capital gains tax and just tax everything at the proper tax rate.   I like the concept of a wealth tax. I‚Äôm just skeptical all of the plans Warren has put out can pass, especially when the wealth tax seems like a linch pin to the everything else.   Do you think it could pass with a senate that is majority run by democrats by small margin?    I think the ideas are good and is the direction I want the country to go. I‚Äôm just not sure if the country will go along. Im looking at ability of progress to happen. Can all at once happen or a stepped approach better?
The wealth tax is popular even with Republicans.  It's more likely to improve favorability with conservatives than decrease it.
If you can apply a tax based on whether someone has health insurance you can absolutely apply a tax based on whether they have $50 million dollars in assets.
There already exists property tax, though, how is this different?
The Constitution also doesn't allow the president to appoint a cabinet, but that's 100% legal and expected because that's how every administration has worked since Washington. The Constitution is not an exhaustive list of what the government can and cannot do
The American Bar Association disagrees with you: https://www.americanbar.org/groups/taxation/publications/abataxtimes_home/19aug/19aug-pp-johnson-a-wealth-tax-is-constitutional/
We tax all kinds of things twice.  Your salary is taxed when it's paid to you (sometimes locally in addition to federally), then you buy things with it and it's often taxed again, then the business pays taxes on the money you gave them.  The wealth tax is only constitutionally questioned because at the federal level there's some unclear wording about "direct taxes", but historically people didn't seem to see that as a hard no on a wealth tax.  Most people in the country already pay a wealth tax in the form of property taxes (the largest asset most people have), it just falls disproportionately on the middle class rather than the ultrawealthy.
I dont think its taxed twice as much as the highest tax bracket just has their taxes increased right?
The constitution gives congress the power to tax. It‚Äôs a political judgment that is not constrained by legal norms‚Äîsimilar to the president in foreign policy or the judiciary in interpreting the law.   It‚Äôs constitutional.
My feeling is that it will not be popular with moderates and conservatives by the time Congress votes on it.  Right now, the media, the Republican Party, Blue Dog or DLC Democrats (and similar), and dark money groups haven't really made opposition to this, and with it an attempt to cast it in negative light and change public opinion, a strong focus yet.  They probably won't do that until a candidate who supports it or some variation on it (Warren and Sanders being the two I know of, though there may be more) takes a commanding lead in primary delegates, becomes the nominee, or becomes the President.  Once groups like that pour money and time into advertising and editorializing against it, it's popularity with certain groups will likely disappear.  Folks may remember what happened with "Hillarycare", the universal healthcare plan developed by Hillary Clinton at Bill Clinton's behest during the early years of the Clinton administration, which was met with a flood of advertisements and other influencing elements funded by the health insurance industry opposing it until public opinion was so negative towards it that it not only didn't pass a Democratic Congress, it may not have even gotten a vote, despite being a proposal by a Democratic President.  People who haven't yet been propagandized on a relatively new subject yet and who just judge it on what little they know about it often will favor something initially.  This sometimes changes after they "learn more about it"- aka all their favorite media outlets and political figures trash it, Russians troll farms do their thing against it, and billionaires flood the air and the Internet with advertisements and "sponsored stories".  People in Congress can expect to have a bunch of lobbyists pounding down their door and warnings from donors and unaffiliated groups that their re-election campaigns won't have their support if they vote for it as well.  I'm not saying that this is the way things should work, but it's the way they do work.  Additionally, any small majority the Democratic Party wins in the Senate will include Joe Manchin and probably some others like him who genuinely oppose this sort of thing on principle.  One might as well add Manchin to the "No" votes on this right now.  The odds of him voting for it are astronomically low.
Those are local taxes, not federal.
Actually funny enough, Kavanaugh just released an opinion where he claimed that what you described basically isn't constitutional. Wouldn't be surprised if this becomes an issue in the next few years because of Trump's shitty Federalist Society judges.
So anything goes if either side gets a majority of votes? Sounds like a good system, I'm sure it will turn out well. /s
No. Calvin H. Johnson, John T. Kipp Chair in Corporate and Business Law at the University of Texas disagrees with me. Hence, he wrote this publication.  Obviously the Supreme Court would have to weight in on this.
Manchin has expressed opposition to other progressive policies, but I'm not aware of him speaking against the wealth tax.  He voted against Trump's tax cut because it favored the wealthy so heavily.  Even accounting for some degree of propaganda to move the needle, the wealth tax is objectively much more popular than other progressive policies, and if only 40% of Republicans support it instead of 57%, that's not a huge cost for a purple Democrat, especially as their Democratic constituents will be moving in the other direction.
Also Bill Barr preaching about unilateral executive authority (as long as the executive isn't a Democrat) to the Federalist society.

This again goes to show that it‚Äôs Elizabeth Warren (not Bernie Sanders) who is becoming the face of the Progressive wing of the party.
The type of celebrity endorsements I wanna hear about!
I was just reading that:  >The 1920s were the last decade in American history during which one could be genuinely optimistic about politics. Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women ‚Äî two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians ‚Äî have rendered the notion of "capitalist democracy" into an oxymoron.  [source](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian)  Pretty sure he's on record continuing that dialogue with things like women being able to vote was a mistake.    He openly wants a world where only rich men like himself have any say in anything.  Make no mistake, whether folks realize it or not, he is an enemy to all but his preferred part of the 1%.  Not quite, if I've read it right. What he was saying was more like:      * "Authentic" freedom is the goal (a precondition for the highest good) * Libertarianism describes the politics of "authentic" freedom   * Women and welfare beneficiaries dislike libertarianism   * Those constituencies make libertarianism nonviable in democratic elections   * Therefore democracy and authentic freedom are ultimately incompatible  And then he goes on to talk about how libertarians shouldn't despair about it being a dead-end in the democracies we know. They can pursue authentic freedom in truly free places, naming "cyberspace", "outer space", and "seasteading" (which I think he has abandoned).     &nbsp;   It's all a little silly, but I found it funny that there were echoes of frustrations on the left that frequently go similar directions. Like, "this shit is fucked we should just go live in space where people won't be stupid and disagree with my philosophies".  When you have all the money you could possibly ever spend, what's next?   Power.   This is a drug for these types. Money was just the first kind of power they got hooked on. After awhile the high isn't so good, the tolerance is too much. Throwing a million around just doesn't *do it* for you. Power comes in far more forms beyond money though. Money is just a (very) basic token of power.

Absolutely
Umm. He's going to sue you to death now. You know that, right?   Seriously, though. He's a truly, truly awful person
Bernie is great but the 2016 baggage is too heavy and he isn't really expanding his base of support, it seems.
This isn't the best example. Bernie has an entire webpage listing about a dozen anti-endorsements from billionaires.
One billionaire (in total good faith I am sure) says he is "scared" of Warren and she's the face of the Progressive wing? Sorry that's a stretch. She's not even a member of the CPC.  If you put the endorsements of the CPC and Our Revolution side by side you'll see there is a *ton* of overlap.  All of the congressional candidates that Our Revolution scouted for 2018 were later endorsed by CPC.  Even more, the 3 of 4 most vocal and well known progressives in the US house ("The Squad") were active Bernie organizers, Justice Democrats (organization started by 2 ardent Sanders supporters, who are still big supporters to this day).  So what exactly has Warren done to earn that title "face of the progressive wing"? What policy agenda has she brought to the spotlight that hadn't been elevated and mainstreamed by Sanders 4 years ago?
Also the late 1910s to 1920s were basically the peak of post civil war racist oppression especially after what Wilson did in making segregation and official oppression federal policy.  In terms of personal freedom, speech, press, association, even firearms, we are far more free than the 1920s. These "libertarians" just only measure freedom by what a rich white man can do.
Jesus, he's more terrible than I even imagine. Does he not realize a neck slices the same way whether you're rich or poor? There is no going back and he's a madman for thinking it's even remotely possible
During the debate I didn‚Äôt hear any new ideas from Bernie just the same abstract talking points. Liz really does seem like she has steps beyond the talking points ready to go to make these changes a reality.
The word socialism and the baggage that comes along with it is too heavy. Old people vote and old people are trained to not like that word, regardless of what it actually means
And a constant drip of negative media coverage.   Think about the important things left out of the news... all the war and violence, all the senseless tragedy our country inflicts on people, all those billions of poor people (many of them our fellow Americans) trying to eek out a living, the ugly climate future we're facing... You have to think it's on purpose. Maybe it doesn't get viewers; maybe it doesn't sell ads. But it's not random.  Then put in the context of the Democratic primary... I don't know what I'm saying. It's just food for thought I guess.
Honest question, do you actually think trolling the Warren sub is going to make people want to vote for Sanders instead?
That was something that struck me too. I went in to the second debate hoping to be wowed by Sanders, but it felt like he was a bit of a broken record. While what he is advocating for is hugely important, I feel like he needs to have "more" ideas than he has, or at least another way to talk about them.
The stump speech is fine, particularly for kind of empty questions, but it really stumbles when he pulls it out in relation to social justice questions. Not everything is about class and turning questions about sexism and racism to the stump conveys the idea that those things don't matter.
He absolutely refused to be pinned down on any policy specifics; it really turned me off, and I say that as someone who voted for him in the 2016 primary.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a need for new ideas when none of his old ideas have been implemented yet. Those old ideas are still the priority.
As a former Sanders voter, Sanders' call for a movement has attracted lots of people who are very interested in winning their conception of "the argument" and missing that it's about inclusively winning the policy and legislative feasibility argument, so one can win the election.
I don't care what you do to be honest, I just can't let a garbage take like \^ that go without getting a word in. Interesting nobody even acknowledged a single point I made, or answered a single question.
Was there ever a chance?   Warren's support is very fluid and diverse, but actual supporters (in this sub) open to shifting their vote to Sanders in the primary is a small minority. I don't think I'm saying anything profound. That's just the nature of things, right?
Bernie supporters insist his consistency is a virtue but it is rather boring if you know the stump by heart.  Feels like there's no personality.
I think there's a whole lot of fluidity still, and no one is going to win the nomination without bringing in voters that at one point supported someone else.  But trolling another candidate's subreddit is a whole lot more likely to harden people against the candidate you support than the reverse.    And if you think that gaining votes from the sub is out of the question, then why do you come here?  Just to argue for fun?
As someone with Bernie as a very close second choice (voted for him in 2016), you're wrong!
A few reasons:   1) argument is a good thing, right? We should keep it sacred. We should be able to agree on that much.  2) Through argument we learn things. I correct my misconceptions and refine my understanding. I don't want to live in my echo chamber. How else do you grow?   3) I improve communication skills. You see what works... what doesn't. I presume others get a similar benefit.  4) Like America, Reddit is a community. Hello, neighbor! Thanks for engaging. This sub engages... sortof. Truth be told, I see a lot of purposeful disengagement, as if it's a unspoken strategy. Maybe it's a dual facet of the dual of the sub. On the one hand, you discuss. On the other, you rally.   5) It's really hard to watch inconsistency. A lot of people here raise the banner of Progressivism, but give Bernie a death by a thousand pithy passive aggressive cuts.   I mean, this last week, Warren was headlining a $175 per ticket convention (Net Roots). Meanwhile, Bernie was on the other side of town protesting a hospital closure and raising funds for "the squad" representatives (who just took a principled stance on detention center policy). Yet, Warren is clearly "becoming the new face of the Progressive wing of the party" with little dissent and 49 upvotes and counting. I'm sure someone will take issue, but that's what I see. And if I'm getting this wrong, what does being progressive mean anyway?   6) I don't get the sense Warren supporters are totally clear about what she stands for. And there's not too much discussion on it. The other day a supporter who called me crazy for saying Warren was for the 99% taxing the 1%.   7) I find Warren supporters fascinating. How they think... their world view...  Anyway, I could go on, but it's time for some shut-eye. Like I said, thanks for engaging...
I certainly hope so...
I like arguing, and I dislike misinformation, but this sub isn't your fun debate training grounds.  No one owes you engagement when you enter a discussion just to create an argument, and that's frequently the pattern that Sanders supporters follow when coming through here.    There's just no real reason for us to continually engage with the next batch of crusaders trying to find some ever smaller wedge to demonstrate why only Bernie is really progressive.  Why should we engage in an argument with people who almost by definition isn't open to changing their mind?
>argument is a good thing, right? We should keep it sacred. We should be able to agree on that much.   There are other ways to challenge a viewpoint than straight up arguing, and those methods will most likely win a lot more people over than "You're wrong!!! The candidate you support is actually terrible!!! This other guy is way better!!!" Especially on a subredddit dedicated to that candidate...
There's a lot to unpack there.   I'll just say I don't think there's an obligation to engage anyone, certainly not if you don't find some measure of joy or meaning in it. Hopefully, you connect with another thinking human being in a conversation. And isn't that enough?   I for one (I don't want to speak for others) am not looking for ever smaller wedge issues to demonstrate only Bernie is progressive. Sometimes you observe these unassailable opinion statements and you think I have a different opinion. And you question why your opinion should be worth less somehow.   This whole thread started when someone said Warren was becoming the new face of the progressive wing (i.e. because Bernie is the old face) because Peter Thiel made an anti-endorsement. This is followed by 9-10 subtle, yet abstract cuts against Bernie ranging from 2016-baggage, to same-old-ideas, to no-personality,  to too boring, to Liz-has-a-lock-on-plans-and-policies. Do you just let that go? Is that an invitation to respond? If I disagree with those statements, what should I do in this situation? You just read that and it becomes a if-not-me-who-if-not-now-when moments. It can be mighty tempting to lay down a comment. Is that trolling?
Sorry, maybe I'm getting a little confused - what other ways are you talking about? Isn't challenging a viewpoint the very definition of argument?   Yeah, I don't appreciate the one-off opinions either. Everyone is the lesser for it.
None of this is a moral turning point demanding action.  "But actually..." isn't going to change the minds of anyone who thinks Bernie's 2016 run leaves him with baggage or that Warren is a better progressive leader.  There's no objective truth on these things, progressivism is larger than any one group or candidate and people are going to have different opinions.  And in the end, if you're entering someone else's space just to start an argument or feed a need within yourself, then yeah, that's trolling.
I mean, this is probably more semantics than anything. But it's definitely possible to have an open + honest discussion about something without arguing. Arguing relies on more or less saying to the other person "you're wrong and here is why you're wrong", and most people aren't open to this. No one wants to truly confront the "you're wrong" moment. A better way would be to question their position/assumptions, share your own opinions, and if they are open to to changing their minds this opens up more room for discussion. If not, arguing with them isn't going to change their mind anyway.
It's anonymous Reddit commentary. The threshold for "demanding action," I think you'll concede, is pretty low. Anyway, I disagree those comments don't have weight, particularly when people hash out their second tier preferences.   I also disagree that people even vote based arguments heard. Rather they fashion their opinions to deeply held preexisting beliefs. The rationale comes after the fact. I think you'll find the science bears that out. So it's more like you're changing minds by altering gut check instincts. Those comments erode trust.  On that last point, I don't want to speak for you, but would you describe this sub as a *safe space*? Or maybe to debate is okay, but outsiders aren't welcome to participate? I mean why can you say things like "there's no objective truth on these things... progressivism is larger than any one group or candidate and people are going to have differing opinions" but I can't?
To the #YangGang - What a great campaign! You should be proud.
Thanks so much for this post. I was YangGang and am very saddened by the news tonight, but wanted to learn more about Warren and really appreciate this post and all the comments. I think Warren - or possibly Sanders - are the best alternatives to support, but I‚Äôm definitely leaning heavily toward Warren. I need to learn more and am so glad this community is here. Thanks!
Much appreciated, I've always felt like the YangGang and Warren supporters had a good relationship, none of the toxic fake stuff. Hope many of us come over to give Liz and Bailey some love.
Nothing to add except I agree with everything you said!
Yes, my hat is off to the entire Yang Gang! I have a soft spot for Yang. He's truly genuine, I feel, and I liked his idea of a freedom dividend. :)  I hope he doesn't disappear from politics entirely, as I'd be interested to see what he does next.
Hey y‚Äôall. With Yang out, Liz is my top choice. Yang, Warren, and Biden were the last people in the race I believe are genuinely good people, and right now Warren looks like the strongest of those.
[deleted]
Agreed! The supporters of his that I know are really smart independent thinkers, so while there have been places I didn't agree with them (e.g., nuclear power), I respected the thinking behind those positions. They also made the point that he's kind of just "a regular person who decided to see if he could become president," so he brought a level of independence and common sense that was appealing. And the Freedom Dividend honestly strikes me as a good idea.
I posted this in a Yang sub as well:  Warren is my candidate, but Yang impressed me SO MUCH during the debates. I started following him and even donated a bit to him. He became my 2nd choice.  We need Yang and people like him in government! I hope hope hope he continues to pursue public service and policy. Whether he runs for president in the next cycle, or gets a cabinet position, or runs for a congressional seat - we need him and people like him to lead us out of this regressive sinkhole we are in.
The freedom divident is going to be a thing one day soon. We just needed someone like Yang to introduce the idea to the masses. Thank you!
I was skeptical of Yang at first, but he showed himself to be a serious candidate and a patriot fighting to make our country better. He and his supporters should be proud of his campaign.
Yang and Booker is my new favorite political bromance.
Fav thing about Yang: he brought up how our current system of tying healthcare to employment is bonkers. It limits people‚Äôs ability to choose the job they want or no job at all. Most people don‚Äôt want to work for the federal government!   I also appreciated his words about children with special needs, caretakers and others who don‚Äôt have much economic value but have great human value nonetheless.  And of course the main message about AI - things are gonna get real bad. He brought a lot to the conversation, and I hope to see him continue to be part of the discourse.   It‚Äôs tough when you‚Äôve invested so much of yourself in a candidate. You made a difference y‚Äôall. Love to Yang Gang.
Y'all are awesome! Ran into Warren canvassers several times on the Yang trail, always awesome people :). Yang helped me get involved in politics, I'm glad to still be also following and supporting Warren. Good luck!
He always struck me and kind and empathetic and I liked how he always talked about how stay at home moms raising kids were being deprived of an income as one of the reasons he wanted the UBI.
I'm glad he was in this race because he really brought the concept of UBI into a more mainstream political conversation. It's something that we need to be thinking about and talking about. Maybe it's not exactly Yang's plan that we land on, but just having the conversation is important as we face our future.
Thank you Yang for fighting to improve our country!
My dream ticket is a Warren + Yang ticket! Talk about unification!
I wish Yang would have talked up his other policies, the FD was the tip of the yang iceberg but yang never acknowledged his other policies because his dumb ass campaign and himself thought people wanted to hear about $1000 for the hundredth time.
I really thought he was going to break 5% there for a while.
I‚Äôm sad to see him go. While I don‚Äôt agree with some of his positions, he brought more to the table than most - his ideas were never stale or tired or derivative. He is truly forward thinking and this country needs more of that. He has a charming and engaging personality, and more than once during a debate he restated another candidates point with more simple clarity than the original candidate. I look forward to following his career.
She did say she was reading his book and she is incorporating other suspended candidates policies.     So logically she's going to incorporate something from Yang.
The best single issue candidate of the last 25 years. Really admire his dedication to UBI and how much fun he had doing this. I will miss him.
Solidarity Forever.
I'm not really a fan of UBI, but the guy ran a great campaign, and elevated the conversation. Remarkable achievement.
Spare a thought also, tho for the Michael Bennett campaign.  That's all i got. He seemed nice.
I really liked him. It was too bad. He was so far behind that I knew he didn't have a chance. It made me feel bad thinking that he didn't.   I liked that he was pro-science and pro-tech. I liked that he was thinking about the future. UBI is being tested on state levels- as of now. I liked that he is young (Gen X) and that he is a man of color. It would be cool if he could be someone's VP. Or he could do something else that could get his ideas in to the real world.   I feel deflated.
I was a Yang supporter and now am curious about Warren and Bernie. Wondering what their big differences in policies are! Thanks! üíÉ

Yang Gang for life !!
I‚Äôm really impressed to see that he dropped out when he had enough money to stay in and make things about him. He is the real deal for sure. It makes me hope he tries for something state or even local in the future. Those people stay around longer, get more done, and have a greater impact on our lives. We need our best candidates at all levels, and I‚Äôd like to have Yang stay active in the party.
Maybe after you win the Presidential seat you can hire him. I agree he has some good ideas.
Yang Gang here (classical liberal leaning).  I used to really like Warren early on in her career, especially during the OWS days. She was even the subject I picked for my grad school speech writing class.  But, since then she keeps looking (to me at least) more and more like business as usual disguised as progressive change.  Her signature selling points has been "I've Got a Plan for That," but I keep being unimpressed by the plans.  One of the big ones for me is her student loan debt plan, since it's been such a big talking point for her during the race. Her plan is largely two-fold: free public school education at 2- and 4-year colleges, and wiping out all student loan debt.  But, it's not public universities that are running up debt numbers, it's private universities, and the one-time debt forgiveness doesn't help anyone who enrolls in a $50k/yr university after that (I happen to teach at one of these, and it's gross).  What's her student debt plan for the students who are accumulating the most debt?  Right now I'm probably leaning Klobuchar, though I vote in a late state so plenty of time to decide. I'm not really impressed by Klobuchar's platform either, but I think she has a much better chance of uniting the different factions of Democrats as well as many of the moderates, while I think Warren is going to alienate the moderates.
Outlasting doesn't mean shit. John Delaney outlasted a lot of people as well

We're happy to have y'all! Look around, maybe check Warren's site when you're ready, but more importantly just ask questions and join us in our discussions.
Welcome!  Yang was and is a sweetheart.  I'm kind of sad that he was the last POC in the race.
You're welcome. :)   Totally understand being disappointed.   Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again. The biggest priority is beating Trump.   What would you like to know more about re: Warren? How much do you know about her background/biography? There's tons of stories and info about her policies, but I also find her history really compelling.
Even though Warren has been my candidate from the start, I'm so grateful that Yang ran. He brought serious and otherwise ignored issues to the political race. When candidates in future elections are talking about addressing automation and UBI, Yang will be the person we all need to thank. I hope he doesn't stop advocating on these issues.
as the remaining candidates go, warren is far & away your best chance at keeping yang's ideas in the conversation and getting them onto a platform that ends up in the general. warren is a collaborator, she listens, she co-signs the good ideas that need signal boosting and she has possibly the most diverse collection of endorsements & high-profile campaign chairs of any candidate. she's already made overtures to yang similar to those she made to castro, so i would be extremely surprised if she doesn't bring yang on board by super tuesday.
I love Andrew Yang and the YangGang! I'm sorry to hear he's out of the campaign.  Please take a look at ElizabethWarren.com and consider joining our all in with warren community! Very welcoming and lovely ppl there! I co-moderate the group Pet Lovers For Warren. Join us on Twitter and Facebook. You are welcome and we'd love to fight along side you for big, structural change! Again, sorry Yang is out. He will be missed, but I feel confident that we haven't heard the last of him.
Bailey love FTW. #LFG! :)
The futurist in me likes UBI, but the wonk in me really liked the Democracy Dollars.  Warren has something that would be effectively similar in her anti-corruption plan, but the messaging for DD was so much cleaner.
I hope he runs for office here in New York. I think he could win.
Cool to hear that Liz is your top choice now! #LFG! :)
Welcome!
I understand Yang/Warren, but what makes you think Biden is a good person?
You don‚Äôt think Bernie‚Äôs a good person?
Wait, you don't think Bernie is a good person? Like, even Ted Cruz said during the last election that Bernie was the most honest person running.  Edit: y'all are dense if you think I'm saying anything nice about Ted Cruz. I'm just recognizing that it's notable when your opponent compliments you.
why don‚Äôt you like pete?
She can win if people vote for her. We‚Äôre only two tiny states into this thing, and a lot can happen between now and June. The biggest test of her campaign will be how she performs on March 3rd. Until then, I‚Äôm not going to worry.
Bernie is a strong front runner right now, but I think Warren still has a path to victory. Klobuchar doesn't have a good ground game or enough money to run ads in the the next states (we're 3 weeks out from Super Tuesday). Buttigieg doesn't have POC support - he won't have the same wins in NV or SC he's enjoyed in Iowa and NH. Biden's support keeps slipping and his SC firewall seems precarious at best. If Biden continues to slip, Klobuchar doesn't have the infrastructure or money to compete, and Buttigieg can't get support from POC - where does that support from those 3 go? Maybe Sanders but seems more likely Warren.   She is 100% still in the game until Super Tuesday at least. She's in a strong position to do well on Super Tuesday and a lot of other candidates aren't. If she is one of the lone survivors past Super Tuesday, she can become the unity candidate and win.   As of now, she's still 3rd in delegates. Buttigieg is going to have a hard time maintaining his #2 position.   That's her path to victory that they've articulated. Seems smart to me. https://medium.com/@TeamWarren_50976/a-look-ahead-f178123f1556
Imma be real: I don't think any candidate is gonna win a delegate majority. I think it's almost a given at this point that a brokered convention at the DNC will happen. I definitely think it'll come down to Biden, Bernie, and Warren. When it does narrow down, it'll probably be around 30% ish support for each of em. So if you like Warren better than the other two, vote for her! :)
"Freedom Dividend" is also really great branding!
Yang is the only candidate with a real presence in my neighborhood besides Bloomberg, and Yang didn‚Äôt buy his way here.   I was very sad when Castro and Booker dropped out because they were the other candidates I supported after Warren. I didn‚Äôt think I would be this sad when Yang‚Äôs campaign ended.  Funny thing, I liked his stance on nuclear power and was impressed by his lonely support of it, but I have been persuaded that UBI would not be an efficient or effective policy approach to the issue it is trying to address. I was happy to finally have the discussion though, so I appreciated his contribution.
It's great to have candidates who don't necessary fit a mold and might bring interesting and innovative ideas to the table.  That's why I liked Yang.
Awww, they do make a lot of sense together. I‚Äôm really glad that their are positive spaces to talk about other candidates too. This race has gotten really negative.
Booker was my #2 for a while after Yang.  What got me over to him was during one of the debates he talked about how the people who spoke with in town halls often were small business owners (or wanted to be), and how Democrats need to stop focusing so much on who they're taking money from and focus more on how they're going to make people's lives better.
Agreed. We need so many more progressives pushing the Overton window to the left.
It was a good policy to grab attention, but he had other cool ones that never really got mentioned when the general public would hear about them.    I personally liked Democracy Dollars a lot as it seemed like a clever way to approach the Citizen's United problem.  Warren's got something effectively similar in her anti-corruption plan, but I think Yang had better messaging (when he did talk about it).
Everyone that's into politics has felt the deflation you feel now. There's been 20 something candidates in the Democrat primary and only 1 wins. I live in Florida currently and was pretty devastated when Nelson lost his senate seat to Rick Scott (Voldemort aka Skeletor), Gillum lost his gubernatorial bid to a Trump troll, and Trump got in office. Literally woke up the morning after the 2016 elections and had cereal with rum. It sucks.   But I don't think Yang would want his Gang to sit idly by. This election is too important. And he'd want you to be proud of what you DID accomplish - your candidate rose from obscurity to getting every Democrat in the country thinking about UBI!   As you move forward, if you have any questions about Warren, we'll be happy to answer.
Bernie is my strong #2. I was with Bernie in 2016. He's the OG and is the real deal.   But I prefere Warren this cycle. It's not because their policies are tremendously different. They're really not. There's some nuance, but they are WAY more alike than they are far apart on the signature issues.  For me, what I like about Warren now is that she's built on those plans and offered way more And she's not afraid to use every lever of power available to create the changes we need. A couple of my favorite examples: She'll use Executive Orders to lower drug prices right away and expand Medicare. She's got a plan for a bill that would require congressional approval for nuclear first strike, which means we won't have to worry as much in the future about an incompetent president nuking someone out of nowhere. (Imagine if Cheetoh Benito had nuked Solemani...) And she's For removing the filibuster if we get a narrow D majority in the Senate so she could pass major legislation.   As far as I know, no other candidate has been in favor of those ideas.   She also gets shit Done! She spearheaded the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before she was even in Congress!   Warren is the one I believe would have the best plan for actually implementing a lot of the big changes the whole progressive movement wants.
Yeah, but that's just because Delaney refused to close up shop.  Yang, with that one exception that was kind of BS, kept making the debate stage.  Doing that meant his ideas and policies had to be taken more seriously than anything Delaney ever said.
Her support has a slight lean towards the younger age categories (unlike Biden and Sanders who each have a ***heavy*** lean toward their respective ends) and she's been consistently the second highest in polling of college students.
Coming from someone who probably thinks 25 is old, that doesn‚Äôt mean much.
Very sad. I really liked and appreciated Yang and his Gang, and I hate how white the slate is.
Tulsi is still in the race
I don‚Äôt really know her history. Would love to hear more.
Aussie here, don't worry shits a bit fucked right now but people like you and the rest of the Democratic gang are going to do just fine :) just make sure one of the two actual candidates get the nom :)
Early in the debates, he always had refreshing takes on issues that he would put into the conversation simply because he was a compassionate human in the room and not so carefully trying to stay on one message, or land one rehearsed retort. The best example I can think of is when moderators had the candidates on the Medicare for All merry-go-round in one of the first three debates and he talked about what it would mean to someone starting a business, a point that nobody was making, but was one of the most important aspects of the debate. Even though he later proposed a much less ambitious health care plan of his own, I appreciated how he was willing to stand up for the positive aspects of an idea even though it wasn't his.  He was a team player (just like Sen. Warren) above all else and I think a few of our remaining candidates should learn from that.
I really don't think Biden is the best choice for president, but he is, in my view, so clearly an incredible and kind person. The tragedies he's endured while still being a happy warrior is amazing.   (It's just that his time has passed. He should've run in 16. He was sharper then. )
Biden obviously isn't my first choice but with him, we have the advantage of him having pre-existing relationships with world leaders so he might be able to fix some of the damage Trump has done on the world stage.
Warren supporter here. Do you not think Biden is a good person? It is pretty extreme to say someone is a bad person, so I‚Äôd wonder what your reasons were, if that was your position. I think he has bad judgment. Especially lately. I think Biden is surrounded by yes men, but people who have met him and been close to him say he is a genuinely empathetic and compassionate person. I believe that based on his record, which shows a lot of poor judgment IMO, but not bad intentions.
No, I don‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt set that much stock by what Ted Cruz thinks.   I think Sanders is a narcissist who should know better than to be running for President at his age.
Bernie is an incredible, wonderful person, but why would Ted Cruz's opinion be relevant on that? Lol!
Imagine basing your opinion on what Ted Cruz says...
I've known plenty of honest assholes.
He has a horrendous record on racial issues.  He says he didn't realize black residents of South Bend suffered from police abuse until he ran for president - after two terms as Mayor. That's either a stupid, embarrassing lie or an incredibly stupid, incredibly embarrassing truth.

I think there's basically two blocks, the centrists and the progressives. So you've got Biden-Buttigieg-Klobuchar, and Sanders-Warren. I think the centrist block has a solid lead in combined support, and the nomination will go to whoever from that group has the right combination of momentum and ability to win over the progressives.  I suspect it'll be Buttigieg over Biden, though Klobuchar could get it if she can maintain her momentum. Klobuchar is probably the most likely to win over progressives, since she doesn't have the baggage Pete is carrying, and being a young(ish) woman will appeal to a lot of people.  Buttigieg might be able to secure the nomination by making a VP offer to Warren. Get her support in exchange for backing her on a signature policy that will secure her long-term legacy. She has the CFPB, but less of a legacy as a politician.
Booker is a genuinely nice guy from everything I‚Äôve read about him. I‚Äôm kind of tired of people who aren‚Äôt basically decent.
Thanks for the well thought out response!
Why should the race of the people running matter?  Warren happens to be white but I doubt that is a factor in anyone voting for her.  The overwhelming majority of the USA is white people either 60.4% percent non-hispanic/latino white people or 76 percent white with hispanic and latinos that identify as white.  The fact that the slate is really white is because America is very white.    https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219  Scroll down to ‚Äúrace and hispanic origin‚Äù for the demographic breakdown by race.

"technically" correct but not practically correct
Strap in. I'm about to get on a little bit of a soap box.   She was born in conservative Oklahoma. 3 older brothers. All joined the military. She was the baby. Her father had a heart attack and couldn't work for a while. Her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears to keep the family afloat. This was a very formative experience for Liz.   Liz got a scholarship to a college like she wanted, but ended up dropping out to get married as her Mom wanted for it. She gave up on her dream of being a teacher.   But then she realized she had another shot at that dream. She found a commuter college where she could get her degree for $50/semester. (Aside - I can't even comprehend higher education that cheap.) She got the degree and then, as she'll tell you, she lived her dream job as a special education teacher. Yay!   I don't remember the specifics here so I may mix up the timeline a bit here, but eventually she got into law school. I think around that time, her first marriage kind of fell apart. I think the man wasn't particularly comfortable with a strong, driven woman for a partner. So she got a divorce. Also got her law degree. But at some point, I THINK as she was starting to teach law (I think she went into teaching law right after she finished law school) she realized she wasn't going to be able to make it work. Too much going on with raising kids + work. So she called her "Aunt B" and Aunt B came over the next day and stayed for 6 years. This was another really formative experience that she talks about - "Not everyone has an Aunt B."   Around that time she found her second and current husband, Bruce Mann. He's a law professor too. They met at a conference and eventually she proposed to him. (Which, personally, I love.) They maintained a long distance relationship as their jobs were in different places until they both ended working at the same school years later.   Here's kind of the point where things really get interesting and aren't just backstory.   Warren spent her professional career in bankruptcy law primarily and studying why people go broke. Her initial conservative Oklahoma values made her think people made bad decisions. As she did the research, she realized it had WAY more to do with circumstance and predatory practices than irresponsible decisions. She saw that the leading cause of bankruptcy was medical bills and realized that's fucked. This is around the time she switched party registration from Republican to Democrat.   So go forward just a little bit and she's a law professor at Harvard, an intellectual leader. (She started blogging on TalkingPointsMemo at this time. They just republished her archive. I wasn't aware of her at this time and haven't read those but some super nerds (I say lovingly - nerds rule the world) found her then and started becoming fans.)   It's now 2008. Obama's won. The economy is pretty fucked. She's a leading academic trying to help create policy that can fix it. (There's a great video of her doing an interview with Jon Stewart on the Daily Show... I can't find it.)   She has an idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It's whole purpose is to protect people from shitty credit card deals, sub-prime mortgages - that sort of thing. While not part of Washington establishment at all, she pushes to get this Federal Bureau created (!). Obama wanted to tap her to run it, but Republicans put up too big of a fight. She was still involved.   But then Republicans started fucking it up. A Republican became senator in Massachusetts. And progressives drafted her to run against him.   This part is key to me. She's not someone who has clearly always wanted to be a politician. She already had her dream job twice over. (I'm sure she loved Harvard law and being an academic as much as being a special ed teacher.) But she got involved with politics because she came to understand that's where she could do the most good to help people.   So she beat an incumbent  Republican in a statewide election in, what was at the time, the most expensive senate campaign in history. Republicans REALLY wanted to keep that seat - they lost.   She's since gone on to be really influential in the senate. There's no shortage of youtube videos of her absolutely destroying people like the CEO of Wells Fargo in committee hearings. She is NOT afraid to pull punches. (Though she's also the candidate that does pinky promises with little girls on the campaign trail. She can be a stone cold bitch when she has to, but she has a lot of empathy and compassion.)   In 2016, there was a big "draft Warren" movement for President. Bernie didnt' jump in until he was Liz wasn't going to run. Ultimately she decided not to. (Probably wise. She was pretty inexperienced at the time and, if you think back to 2015, all signs pointed to the inevitability of an HRC presidency.) She didn't endorse Bernie because HRC seemed such a shoe-in. Instead, as recent articles have pointed out, she pressured the hell out of the Clinton campaign to adopt policies and people that would look out for the working person.   Obviously things didn't turn out the way we hoped.   But now she's in the race, deciding the best way to have the outcome she wants is to do the damn thing herself.   There's a lot of reasons why I love her as a candidate. Everyone knows "She has a plan for that" right? But they're great. They're detailed. Even when she took some heat on showing her work of how to pay for M4A, she stood by it. AND her plan shows how to do it without raising a penny in taxes on the middle class.   She knows Washington is working great for the people at the top while the rest of us get less and less, but she also understands that corruption is the biggest problem. She has the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. And god knows, we need it.   She's not afraid to take the hard positions even when it's not apparent they're politically expedient - she was the first of the major candidates to call for the impeachment of Trump. She's not afraid to meet the moment.   But she's also good at building support and using all the levers of power available to her to influence change. Again, see the influence she had on Clinton campaign and that was all very behind the scenes.   But a lot of her plans for President face the realities of the time. She's the only major candidate (I think) that's willing to scrap the filibuster so we can overcome Mitch McConnell's legislative graveyard if we get a slight majority in the Senate. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong on that but I think she's the only major candidate to say that.) She's willing to aggressively use executive power to lower drug prices and more on day 1 - her outlook is do the most good for the most people as quickly as possible and build on that. And she can work with people all over the ideological spectrum to pass legislation.   Take a look at her youtube channel for a bit more: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrj-0FxK19tgUR2EbHkBBGg/videos  Love this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL73hl_xlyk  Hope all that helps a bit. Keep the questions coming! :)
Lol I'd love to hear why
Sanders is only a year older than Biden.
he made that much clear when he chose to run AFTER warren had announced. if he truly thought of her as his progressive ally, his *friend,* and someone he wanted to see run instead of himself in 2016, then he would have congratulated her and supported her instead of deciding to compete against her.
I don't care about Cruz either, but it's notable when even your opponent compliments you.
Oh yea dude, I totally considered Bernie Sanders a rapist murderer pedophile before, but after Ted Cruz's comments I can't wait for my Lord and Savior Bernie Sanders to win the nomination!
You find Bernie to be an asshole?
good to know!
Sure
Yeah no. Super Tuesday doesn‚Äôt care about the centrists, with the exception of Biden. I say this as a Texan who also loves Amy‚Äî neither she nor Pete are going to find footing in Super Tuesday. The field *will* narrow down, and Amy and Pete don‚Äôt have the campaign infrastructure nor name recognition in ST states (*especially* the South) to carry on.  And again, I‚Äôll be real: the diehard Berners won‚Äôt vote for any of the centrists. Especially not Amy or Pete, given their blatant denouncement by Black Lives Matter and worrisome records on race, respectively. His record as mayor and her record as a Prosecutor‚Äî believe me, they all got plenty of baggage.  I‚Äôll reiterate: Not saying this as a diehard who‚Äôs trying to tear down the others. I‚Äôd love (now that so many people who I liked dropped out) either a Warren-Klobuchar or Biden-Warren ticket, though my foremost preference is clearly for neither.  Realistically, the outcome at the DNC will either be a Sanders-Warren ticket, since that‚Äôs as far as Bernie is willing to go to ‚Äúunite‚Äù with ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù. Or a Warren ticket where Bernie drops out and endorses her to give her his delegates, likely with either Stacey Abram, Julian Castro, or Andrew Gillum as VP. Or a ticket with Biden and Stacey Abrams (it‚Äôs not even a question at this point) where superdelegates will once again make the mistake of ignoring progressives completely. Those are the only three possibilities.  Im willing to throw in my chips with Warren because 1) I love her, and I‚Äôll fight to the end. And 2) Regardless of Twitter/Reddit trolls, she remains the only candidate who can appeal to both factions of the party. There‚Äôs a legitimate reason for this: the number one thing with progressive voters is you can‚Äôt denigrate their political views. Pete calls it purity tests and ‚Äúmy way or the highway,‚Äù Amy calls it ‚Äúthings that look good on a bumper sticker‚Äù, etc. Despite her drama with Bernie, the one candidate who‚Äôs taken care to not insult one wing of the party or the other, is Warren, except for the occasional declaration of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fight for big ideas!‚Äù
My pleasure! More questions? :)
[removed]
It is a simply a fact that she is both a poc and and still in the race.  She won't win but she is in the race.
Removed, Civility.
Such an insightful post! I appreciate Warren even more.
Democrats, ya gotta believe in Elizabeth Warren to get her elected
I do.
"Electable" is just fear talking. There is no such thing as Electable. Stop being pundits, and vote for who you want. It doesn't matter what your neighbor thinks.
I'll vote for any 2020 candidate with a D for President but I would be excited to vote for Warren.
Im really scared of Bernie and Warren splitting the progressive vote in the primaires. I love them both but I hope we can all rally behind whoever takes the initial lead. I fear if we don't we might end up with Biden.
üëä üëä üëä !!! Go, President Warren!
Elizabeth Warren has a plan for the future that I believe in.
Her and Bernie are both way better than Biden.
Done
Oh, I believe in Warren. It‚Äôs the American people I‚Äôm skeptical of. Defeatist attitude aside, she‚Äôs the only candidate I‚Äôm excited about and she can absolutely win this thing.
Her plans make sense and she doesn't appear to be yielding to "special interests"... She's intelligent, hard working, optimistic and pragmatic!  She has earned my support more so than any other candidate thus far.  May the force be with her!
Please vote for her.  I honestly believe this politician is willing to fight for all of us. Fuck the donor class and fuck joe Biden...  If Joe Biden wins the nomination I‚Äôll vote for the guy but I‚Äôll fucking hate the fact that it came down to that.
She made me a believer!
She won me over!
I‚Äôm not an American. But if I were, I‚Äôd vote Warren based on substance and well thought out policies and proposals. As many have already mentioned - electability is a matter of opinion. Trump will of course push the Native American issue. I just hope people are smart enough to not let it become ‚Äúwhat about her ancestry‚Äù. Also, she is not ‚Äúfar left‚Äù, in my opinion. Many of her policies are already in place throughout the developed world. It‚Äôs time for America to catch up, before it‚Äôs too late.
Bernie>Elizabeth>Rest of field imo but we need a blue congress for either to do much
I mean, she's like my third choice, but sure I believe in her. Just thinks she's more of a quality VP... Just doesn't have the charisma or popularity.
Shame the term "electable".
Fuck yea. Aunt Liz is gonna do it.
If you talked to people on 2007 they would have not said Obama was electable. I certainly did not think Donald Trump was electable in 2015. Electability is a fallacy and we‚Äôve got to combat it.
Not to mention that one person‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúelectable‚Äù may differ greatly from someone else‚Äôs.
Yep. The Republicans learned their lesson too. They made McCain their nominee in 2008, and Romney in 2012, because they were seen as the most moderate, the most electable.   Then, they decided to nominate a right-wing lunatic, and unfortunately, he won.
I think Elizabeth Warren is plenty electable anyhow. She's intelligent, she's thoughtful, she's good-hearted, and she is a damn fighter.  When people hear her speak and see how much she *cares* about the everyday person, they'll see.
There is only 1 "electable" candidate, and thats the one who wins   Trump is electable.  Obama is electable.  Bush, Clinton and Carter are electable.  Those are the only folks alive who can legitimately claim electability.
Well we knew hillary wasnt electable and yet someone got her up against trump.  Also I am not electable. So I know what I am talking about when I say not everyone is electable.  I'm funny and cute but I got no gravitas.  Edit: apparently I am just cute.
She is a Lisa Simpson sort of person. The show predicted Trump would be president, and Lisa would follow him. So if one of the dozens of other candidates isn't names Lisa Simpson, I think Warren will win.
I got downvoted to hell on Bernie's Sub for saying they shouldn't name call warren. Critique her policies but don't say awful things about her. (They said she looked like she's give the worst BJ ever or something)
If no one gets a majority, and together they can form a majority of delegates, one of them could still win in a brokered convention.
How can you be worried about something that's already happening? Progressives are at war with each other in every comment thread about Liz or Bernie.  This is surely the donor party's plan to usher in Biden, and Trump will wax the floor with him if that happens. I'm already preparing for it.
Everyone is better than Biden. Biden is terrible
Who is your second choice and why?
There's no point in Warren, or any other major candidate besides maybe Buttigieg, being VP. And charisma is subjective, but polls showing that her popularity is growing are piling up by the day.
Eh. The charismatic candidates don't seem to have much in the way of policy or are too moderate.
Hillary "Wasn't electable" yet won by 3 million votes. Remember?
I am subbed to both, donate to both and I suspect a lot of the divisiveness between Bernie's sub and here is manufactured by bad faith actors. Try not to let some people color your view of Sanders supporters. I suspect Bernie wouldn't approve of his supporters name calling Warren either.
Ugh, that's awful. We should refrain from name-calling any of the Democratic candidates... I think we as a sub are doing a pretty good job, but sometimes it's easy to get caught up in the frustration. Anyway, thanks for rising up against the pettiness.
Yeah, that‚Äôs clearly bogus criticism. I‚Äôm a fan of both candidates.  I base my vote based on policy slates and legislative history, not personality or club membership or appearance or any of these other things that just *do not matter*.  I have no problem with harsh critique of candidates, but it should be rooted in critique of policy. Schoolyard taunts are so very Trumpy.
Fucking christ, as if anyone posting that even knows what a BJ feels like.
I guess Bernie must have the BJ face their looking for.
The "But she used to be a republican" is a tired line that I hear alot from them.
I'm a huge Warren supporter but am completely opposed to Bernie Sanders. But most of all I very much dislike his supporters.  It's so insulting to me that a popular narrative is that the *media* (the monolithic synchronized entity that they are) is propping Warren to knock Sanders. It couldn't possibly be that she's climbing in the polls because she's a *good candidate*.
That's interesting. Jesus though I don't know if I can deal with something like that haha. Will be so divisive before the general.
Yep. If sanders and warren both do well and have a clear collective majority and Biden wins with a slim plurality, I‚Äôd hope the delegates would pick a progressive.  Preventing a weak plurality victor from defeating a spoiled aligned bloc is exactly why we *have* a convention instead of casting votes directly.
That's super interesting. Does anybody know if a person getting 30% of the vote in a primary, gains the same amount of delegates as 2 people combined each getting 15%+? And the rest of the delegates are split proportionally, or do the winner of the state get extra delegates?   Either way that would be an exciting scenario, progressives pooling their delegates in a contested convention and winning in the end!
We're talking getting elected not votes. 2 completely different things.  Read up on then electoral college.
true, bernie wouldn't stoop that low. at least he acknowledges her good points like being a female and being... younger  https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-warren-beating-polls-elect-woman-1445065  but tbh some bernie supporters are irrational and make unsupported claims against other candidates. i see them on youtube and twitter mostly
Let‚Äôs not forget about troll farms. They do more than convince your idiot uncle to vote for trump, they also work to divide Dems. Take the primaries seriously, and vote for who you think is best, but don‚Äôt be a dick during, and do close ranks after, the primaries.
That's exactly what I thought. If I was in the mood to argue I'd have said Bernie wouldn't appreciate that. It really disturbed me how many of them wanted to see blood. I want debate over policies, not name calling. We aren't Trump. We're better than that. And I know Bernie supporters aren't all like that. It's warren or Bernie for me, it just comes down to debates. I wish we had list voting
It always makes you wonder when you see that sort of juvenile insult whether the person is just idiotically emulating MAGA culture or is actually from MAGA culture and simply roleplaying as a progressive to stir up shit.  Either way they just should be treated as one would a MAGA troll by both sides of whatever division they're attempting to create.
I like Sanders, it's down to him or Warren, but she's a legit contender and not a fake
Why is it insulting? If it's true, what difference does it make how it makes you feel? Also, what changed about warren in the last several months? I don't see any changes, and yet the media covers her now so much differently than when she started her campaign. First it was Kamala, then it was Beto, then Pete, now it's Warren's turn to get media darling's treatment.   Besides, can't it be both? Media is propping her up, and that she's genuinely getting traction with the voters?
To add more intrigue, it might bring superdelegates into play, too.
It's extremely complicated, and I'm definitely not an expert.  Even winning delegates is complicated and not precisely proportional.  There are all kinds of state-specific rules.  For instance, some caucus states might say you need to have at least fifteen percent to be viable and have delegates awarded.  Some might have multiple nominating conventions.  But they are kind of sort of awarded proportionally.  So then, once candidates have a certain number of delegates, there will be a first round of voting at the national convention.  Superdelegates will not vote in this round.  If there's a majority for someone, we have our winner.  If not, the candidates get to horse trade.  Can they form a majority with some other group and agree on the ticket?  Superdelegates will be voting in this round.  And to make matters more complicated, the candidates own pledged delegates can vote however they want, too. In general, they're very likely to follow their candidate, but they don't have to.  But basically, some group of delegates need to agree on a candidate and get to a majority.
That ‚Äò3 million votes‚Äô statement is true for the primaries as well.
Bernie is a class act, I‚Äôve been a fan for years- my only criticism is he appears to not take serious responsibility for his followers.
I wouldn't worry too much about them.  They're more biased toward running up the numbers to create a stronger general election challenger than trying to throw the nomination to a minority candidate.  They mostly all switched over to Obama as soon as he took the delegate lead and I don't think they'd act any differently if presented with a majority coalition against a plurality candidate.
She won by 4 million in the primary.
Just met Elizabeth at her town hall in Laconia New Hampshire!! We in this fight üí™

Great pic! You're really cute, OP!
You two have similar facial structures
You can tell her cheeks are so tensed up because she has to take a gazillion selfies at every single rally.  Werk it gurl!
Great pic! Hey, does anyone know where I can see her schedule? I keep seeing that she's doing town halls near me but never hear about it in advance

Hey, at least you can theoretically *drive* to a presidential candidate appearance!
I mean the only time New Hampshire is ever in the news is during presidential elections because we're the first state to vote (for some reason) so there's a ton of campaigning here. Other than that we're a boring ass state full of granite and iced coffee.
In case you need to feel even worse, [this is what the area around Laconia looks like this time of year](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjm-6zq7cLlAhVNmeAKHTUNDEQQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=%2Furl%3Fsa%3Di%26rct%3Dj%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26source%3Dimages%26cd%3D%26ved%3D%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpixels.com%252Ffeatured%252F1-lake-winnipesaukee-fall-foliage-john-burk.html%26psig%3DAOvVaw1fLDzZ9h0-N5_Y41rCpPJ6%26ust%3D1572486210597093&psig=AOvVaw1fLDzZ9h0-N5_Y41rCpPJ6&ust=1572486210597093).
Weird that you assumed I was gay based on one picture of me.   Then again.....you right lmao
I've been complimented more in these comments than I have in total in my entire life.   Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Mama?
Her website! Go to events and search for some in your area. You can narrow the results to closest to you and dates. Make sure you look for ones that she'll be speaking at! Cause a lot of them are her supporters holding Town Halls when she's not actually there.
Idk if that's supposed to be an insult or something, but Democrats really are the party of diversity statistics wise, in terms of how minorites and different races tend to vote.   We're the party that supports equality so it's not surprising we're the more diverse party.
You must be in southern NH
Don't talk about granite and coffee that way! Sincerely, Washington (state)

I live in Milton NH. Super small town, and Laconia is only around 45 minutes away. We went like 2 hours early to stand in line for seats and I was in the second row (most of the first row was reserved). Glad we got there so early cause boy there was a long line!
Listen don't get me wrong, I love me some iced coffee and mÃ∂aÃ∂kÃ∂iÃ∂nÃ∂gÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂uÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂nÃ∂  granite countertops just as much as the next gay.

I mean I'm self aware. I have a rainbow arm band tattoo and love Lady Gaga. I'm a tad feminine, but that's okay.   Anyway yeah it's very obvious I'm gay. From just a picture though I was impressed.
Northern NH also definitely a lot of small towns, but certainly wouldn‚Äôt call it boring. It‚Äôs gorgeous and I love it up here so much. I‚Äôm glad you got to meet EW though! Was hoping to go down to see here there as well but had to work

New plan alert! "It‚Äôs illegal to lie to Congress, to a court, and even to your shareholders. It should also be illegal for Exxon and other giant corporations to lie to federal regulators. I've got a plan for that."
This is the kind of thing that I've dubbed in the past as "No shit" legislation. No reason this shouldn't already be a law, except for massive corporate lobbying.
This is why I'm team Warren. Policy proposals like this. So smart. So thoughtful. So obviously looking out for the average person and not the status quo.   Can you imagine what our country would be like if we had 8 years of her and her team at the helm?
Corporations should not be people, and the people running them should be held responsible.   Fuck literally anyone who says otherwise.
You would think laws against corporate perjury would already be there!\~
The cynic in me says that corporations will just find less-obvious ways of generating junk data and pushing those studies through peer review in low-tier journals and the like in order to skirt this.  Not that that's a reason to not enact this law, but I do think it'll be hard to fully enforce.
   >As early as  1982 ‚Äì well before the public knew about the dire threat posed by  climate change ‚Äì Exxon‚Äôs own scientists proved that climate change was  real. That wasn‚Äôt even the first time that scientists warned Exxon and  other fossil fuel companies that their product was warming the planet  and putting lives at risk. As early as 1977, Exxon‚Äôs in-house senior  scientist [presented](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15092015/Exxons-own-research-confirmed-fossil-fuels-role-in-global-warming)  sobering evidence to Exxon‚Äôs management showing that fossil fuel  emissions were driving global climate change. By 1980, Exxon‚Äôs  scientists [openly recognized](https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smoke-Fumes-FINAL.pdf)  the scientific consensus that fossil fuels would likely cause a global  temperature increase of between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, and oil  companies began to plan for climate-related risks to their assets.   >   >Exxon could have shared its science with the public. But along with the rest of the industry, it chose a different path.¬†  So, holy shit, not just lying, but lying about climate change. Sounds like we could have had a 30 year head start on addressing climate change, but nooooo, gotta get my profits.
Can we include lying to the general public as well please?
[removed]
Ministry of truth sounds kinda scary, not gonna lie.

This is half about shining a spotlight on the practice.
> The cynic in me says that corporations will just find less-obvious ways of generating junk data and pushing those studies through peer review in low-tier journals and the like in order to skirt this.  Sure, and murderers who are particularly motivated will try to find a way to get away with it anyway as well. That's not a reason to avoid making laws telling them to cut that shit out. Otherwise what's the point of civilization?
Even if that is true, then this would pose a barrier that makes it that much harder for corporations to lie to federal agencies. Which should reduce the practice if not stop it entirely. No criminal law will be effective at stopping 100% of the target behavior, and that‚Äôs not a good way to look at it.   It‚Äôs my understanding that there‚Äôs currently no legal mechanism for the state to punish corporations who present fake data to try and influence regulations. With this law, such a mechanism would exist. That‚Äôs 100% a win for the American people.  Also, ‚Äúenforcement‚Äù would be handled in court. As she notes on her website, the bar would of course be high. The state would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the corporate actors intentionally presented incorrect information. It‚Äôs very hard to prove intent. But it‚Äôs also important that the bar be set high as we wouldn‚Äôt want to discourage legitimate attempts to join the discussion or, even worse, prosecute someone for an honest mistake.  I‚Äôve been lukewarm on Warren lately, but this policy is a huge slam dunk in my view. She‚Äôs back up to my #2 slot in the primary for sure. Still a long way until my state‚Äôs primary, so I can‚Äôt wait to see how the race develops.
Removed for trolling.  Spend your time on more productive endeavors.
Warren was told by her family she had Native American ancestors and a DNA test confirmed that.  She never claimed she was a tribal member. Her hiring had nothing to do with her ancestry as the people hiring her have confirmed they saw her as white woman.  https://facts.elizabethwarren.com/family/
Removed for trolling.
Absolutely. I'm all for anything that will even slightly move the needle toward more accountability. I'm just also highly cynical about the level of power held by corporations and whether we can ever get to a place where we're operating on a level playing field, so to speak.  Though the panic among billionaires and corporations about Warren's candidacy is giving me more and more hope on that front every day!
Did you stop reading my (very short) comment after the first sentence?  "Not that that's a reason to not enact this law..."
>Even if that is true, then this would pose a barrier that makes it that much harder for corporations to lie to federal agencies. Which should reduce the practice if not stop it entirely. No criminal law will be effective at stopping 100% of the target behavior, and that‚Äôs not a good way to look at it.  Totally agreed, which is why I also said, "Not that that's a reason to not enact this law..." I think it's a no-brainer. I just also think it's important to be clear-eyed when we talk about enacting these policies and understand that it's always going to require us to fight tooth-and-nail to overcome some of these massive forces that distort both the economy and our political system.  >I‚Äôve been lukewarm on Warren lately  Might I ask why? I don't want to get into an argument or anything; I'm just primarily surrounded by other Warren supporters in my social circle, so I like to try and understand where other voters are coming from in the primary.
Nope! This is the internet, I don't have time for that shit and I haven't had my coffee yet!  Sorry. My bad.
Haha, no worries. Apologies for the shortness of tone; people make mistakes!   Get that coffee and have a good one, friend!

That is one wild photo! Imagine looking at a massive crowd from afar, and they‚Äôre waiting for you.
She is smart. There is a reason she stayed back and took all those selfies. The marketing value on social media is great. I am gonna be working very hard to make her the next president. Its high time we took our democracy back
[deleted]
I love her.
woah what a cool picture
‚ù§
Out of curiousity, when do presidential candidates start getting secret service detail?  With crowds that size and her selfie lines I always worry about somethibg bad happening.  Especially in todays environment
Fake news. Photoshopped. Paid actors. My inauguration was bigger.
This is an awesome photo.  But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves. We have a long way and a lot of hard work ahead of us before a nominee is chosen, let alone the President. We can‚Äôt afford to get complacent.  And, don‚Äôt forget, even if Warren sails to victory - we still need the Senate. None of the most ambitious plans will pass unless the Senate is under Democratic control. Big structural change requires sustained energy from top to bottom.

It's not real unless she tweets about having the largest crowd EVER. No one has bigger crowds than her. They asked the mayor of New York and confirmed that this was the largest gathering of people for a politician in NYC history!  ^^^^^/s

Shit, yeah! They're going to have to close down the town.
Not to mention the contrast of Biden not doing any of that
Seriously. I've been hoping for a whip smart professor as President since forever. I wished Lawrence Lessig had a bigger candidacy (or ran for state office) back in 2016.  Even Obama, a man who I greatly respect, is too much theatre.   America needs its theatre and drama to be toned down, and I hope Warren is the one to do it. We need to learn from the boring politics of places like the Netherlands. **Make politics boring again. Make politics about policy again.**
I believe it‚Äôs after the nominee is chosen
Scary to think about :(  I am sure she has private security in the mean time
Your comment has been removed as spam.  This is not the way to promote a candidate.  If you want to continue posting here, please remain substantive and respond to the topic at hand.
You made a new account just to say that?
It's amazing how he can do none of that and then still win the nomination
"Cool" Obama was too theatrical for you? His calm demeanor is legendary!  Politics is never all about policy. Narrative is too important. Democrats often fail to make headway when Republicans make a policy or messaging mistake because of this aversion.   To add, Warren absolutely has a sense of narrative, of the story she needs to tell and present. The whole rally was about connecting the dots between her, women leaders, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, and the labor movement. Every single rally she stands in front of a giant American flag, and that's often the only decoration. It's subtle, but it's still theatre. (I approve of all this, btw. I think theatricality can be a good thing, and helpful :-)
This, unless there are exceptional credible death threats.  [By May 2007, Sen. Obama was approved for Secret Service protection by the secretary of Homeland Security, marking the first time in history a presidential candidate received Secret Service protection almost two years prior to the presidential election.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-candidate-secret-service-protection-factors-analysis/story?id=62513154).  Given how hated and vilified Hillary Clinton was, she likely would‚Äôve had secret service protection during the primary if she hadn‚Äôt already been a presidential spouse.
I dunno I remember Bernie getting secret service detail and he was never chosen

He definitely has a strong position on technology that is feasible. It is in fact so feasible that I could foresee Elizabeth adopting it piecemeal if not wholesale, similar to her partnering with Inslee on climate (this was a bigger get than I think many people realize because of his strong positions on climate). I‚Äôm sure when Yang is in the process of dropping out he‚Äôll approach her regarding an endorsement on the condition of further development/endorsement of her tech plans into the direction of his. She is very pragmatic and I do not doubt that she would be open to at least some of his ideas. Perhaps even a cabinet position.   I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why most of these candidates are running anyways. Beto probably wants HHS or HUD, Gabbard wants State (but won‚Äôt get it) or UN Ambassador (not likely but maybe)? Harris wants AG, Booker wants HUD or Agriculture. Marianne Williamson wants to head the Department of Peace (teehee). Delaney wants Agriculture. Inslee wants Energy. Etc. etc. etc.  Most of them know they would never, ever be president. Not in this election. It will be Warren. It will not be Sanders. Biden has so many gaffes and appears so addled that his numbers will start softening soon. The dark horse candidates for me are Yang and Buttigieg - Yang is simple and consistent with his messaging, and Buttigieg hasn‚Äôt been hurt by scandals (but hasn‚Äôt gotten any better in numbers - could improve when more drop out?). I do not see either being the likely candidate, however. Their messaging just doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking hold the way Warren‚Äôs has.   That ‚ÄúTwo cents‚Äù chant is going on a shirt if it hasn‚Äôt already.
I met @ewarren about 15 years ago. She ran past in a white rabbit costume, shouting "I'm late! I'm late! For a very important date!" It was part of a fundraiser so law students could do public interest work instead of corporate work over the summer. That's her authentic self.
She‚Äôs such a dork I love her.
I misread this as 15 hours ago and I was like what is Warren doing on the campaign trail üòÇ
I love the nerdy vibe Warren gives off. I'm ready for a POTUS who likes to wonk out and problem solve.
The silence from AOC on Kyle Kulinski's idiotic tweet is quite remarkable. She was literally sniped about her dancing, but when it is someone from inside her camp doing it to another woman candidate she goes silent.
This made me giggle with glee.  I am here for Earnest Nerd 2020.
what? haven't you heard? all women in politics are 'not authentic' or something!  if they dance, not authentic.  If they don't ever dance, they are too stiff and reserved, too unlikable!
I absolutely adore her personality and communication style.
I love this so much!
America needs more dorks!
If this had said 15 hours ago I would have guessed mushrooms.  But that would be a massive improvement over the amphetamines the current president does. At least mushrooms force introspection and thinking about consequences
I'm a big ol fan of AOC but I'm stunned that she didn't stand up for Warren. I'm very disappointed that the left is willing to ignore or defend sexism when it's their guy doing it.
Snap.
EDIT: I missed that Justice Democrats association. Still kinda skeptical that she needs to answer for it.     Is there some sort of association between AOC and Kulinski that I'm not aware of? Because if not I really don't think its AOC's responsibility to denounce that.   Expecting her to answer for some fratty white-collar douche seems kind of problematic. It would be nice of her to, obviously, but expecting her to have a position on every shit take some leftist has is just another example of Twitter's utter toxicity.
I‚Äôm OOTL here but I don‚Äôt believe AOC is obligated to comment about Kyle Kulinski.
How is that tweet idiotic?
Rule 4.
One of my "favorites" in this genre was a white guy on Twitter calling out Kamala Harris for putting hot sauce on her greens. He claimed it was pandering to black people. I just...what do you even do with that level of yuck?
Amazing username by the way.
I prefer to call them 'technocrats'. And, yes, we need more of them.
AOC is on just as thin ice with brocialists as Warren is, a few months ago they were ready to drop her because she wasn't endorsing Bernie fast enough.  Women candidates can never be left enough for them no matter who they are.
I know! I truly believe that you can call someone‚Äôs problematic behavior out while still agreeing with them on most other things. It shows that you have integrity over certain matters. It is disappointing that she chose to go silent on this.
If you‚Äôre shocked that the left is often deeply sexist and racist what rock have you been hiding under? Don‚Äôt want to break rule 4 here but there‚Äôs a long history of that sort of behavior from the entire party
How is that sexism?
How is it sexism?
I wouldn't say she's obligated but given her history of being given a hard time also for dancing she certainly could've stood up for Liz.
It‚Äôs just that AOC is always so quick to respond to things. Her silence on something like this is out of place for her given her history of clap backs.
or maybe she was pandering to Indian people!  yeah, hillary got shit for saying she carried hot sauce with her too, like a think tank would dream that up for her or something
Put more hot sauce on it, eventually maybe you can burn out the yuck?  Bleh.  Hot sauce on greens is just pandering to your tastebuds!
Brocialist is my new favorite word.
It's entrenched in our society. It's hard to call out people you respect doing the same shit you call out the others for doing.
>deeply sexist  It was saddening to see the two candidates that had to apologize for seeming angry in their speech were both women. No one took issue to Joe Biden yelling like he forgot his hearing aid at some of these debates. I've had to turn down the volume a few times when he spoke.
Accusing women of being inauthentic is the most pervasive "this is why we can't trust women" stereotype. I can't find the comment ATM but yesterday someone listed the ways it presents today: golddiggers, women lying about rape, women pretending to hold views to get ahead, so on.
Also Kulinski is a founding member of the organization AOC is a part of.
I think it is a much better term than 'Bernie bro' imo because it is critical towards a specific type of leftist while bernie bro is often used to make it look like he only has a support base of young white dudes or something, which isn't true. (and it's less ameri-centric because other countries have their brocialists too)
It's hard but necessary. We can't all turn into hypocrites.
Absolutely.  I didn't mean to imply that it was exclusive to Democrats.  Yet, many of them think sexism and racism is the purview of Republicans alone.
So, what do you suppose we do when a woman *is* being inauthentic?
>It's hard but necessary. We can't all turn into hypocrites.  You can try it here, but your comment will be removed for violating rule 4, lol
I agree, we saw it heavily in Bernie supporters in 2016. Bernie is very pro women, but his movement sparked a lot of sexism. Warren herself isn't clean either and I don't want to just call out Bernie. It was more of a he never addressed a big concern and he needed to.
Build up evidence and provide it in a rational way, pretty much the opposite of screeching about dancing on Twitter - something that has happened to AOC and Warren.
sourced and substantive critiques of Democrats do not violate Rule 4.
[deleted]
Literal decades of extreme sexism and racism from and within the Democratic party and you decide to be divisive against a current candidate running for the nomination.  Cool
Okay, so your disagree with the tactic.  Would you say it is sexist to do the same for Booker's dad jokes, or Biden's senior moments?
no shit, I was just making a reference to the seething hypocrisy here when it comes to other Dems who are racist and/or sexist
Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize I couldn't call out Bernie... My bad. I guess we only call out those that aren't Bernie...    Cool. Way to literally do exactly what you were just complaining about.
What the fuck are you on about? I'm not going to argue about random garbage with someone who thinks women who dance (the horror) are inauthentic or incapable. That's the conversation here, not whatever new goalpost you plan to drag out of your closet.
Bernie isn‚Äôt the sexist one
The issue isn't women dancing. People can fucking dance if they want to dance.  The issue is trying to pass scripted humor/spontaneity off as organic.
Cool story, I mean the fact that he had to apologize to women in his 2016 campaign says something... He is aware of the sexism his campaign attracts yet never addresses it  Glad to see your bad faith argument really highlighted here though...
Uh-huh.     The kind of person who would dress up as the White Rabbit for a goofy college thing as a grandma is the kind of person who would dance like that. Big whoop.
Reminder that Warren wants FULL SINGLE PAYER a full year before Bernie, with stopgaps along the way for the most needy. If you don‚Äôt believe her when she makes claims but believe everything Bernie claims he‚Äôll do, maybe examine why and the factors that could lead you to disbelieve her.
If you're passionate about giving single-payer healthcare a fighting chance in this country, Elizabeth Warren is your candidate.
I believe this because we've seen the power of access with Medicare under ACA. The few who got access to it, are the ones who attest to its viability.  This is why I don't agree when people blame obama for settling on a "bad law". He had no choice. It was either something or nothing and that "something" gave people a reason to dream bigger and demand M4A.
Single payer makes sense but the most important issue is democracy.  I will support Warren because she has the energy and commitment to regulating, the "free" market is the greatest threat to what our country stands for!  [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/15/21054083/elizabeth-warren-2020-democratic-primary](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/15/21054083/elizabeth-warren-2020-democratic-primary)
It drives me CRAZY all the people who claim she walked back her promise for Medicare for all bc if anything, her plan is more likely to actually get implemented
I cannot upvote this strongly enough. Love, love this plan.
It annoys me to no end how willfully stupid people are about warren. Anyone who says ‚Äúshe backtracked M4A‚Äù immediately invalidates any other opinion or stance they have on her IMO. If you can‚Äôt be bothered to at least skim the bolded text on one of her flagship proposals, you don‚Äôt know shit and I don‚Äôt care what you have to say.
I feel like the Bernie supporters are oblivious to this. Bernie is promising more, but with no plan how to enact anything. Warren has proven experience making deals like this work. So frustrating that she‚Äôs not doing better than Bernie. She‚Äôs even a better debater. I‚Äôll vote for Bernie if he‚Äôs the nominee, but I‚Äôm worried about his ability to close the deal and beat Trump.
She needs to attack Bernie from the left on M4A. Warren is the only one who can leave a mark on him at the debate by attacking him from the left and not the right like everybody else on stage. Hit him for not having answers on how to pay for it or implement it. For constantly scoffing at and scolding anyone who tries to challenge him on the issue. She needs to make the case for why she is the candidate to trust in getting M4A passed.  Ask him why he won't commit to ending the filibuster.
And she said she will do it first day in office!

"I'm the idea guy! I let the women do the unpopular hard work of figuring out how to revolutionize healthcare. First, let her deal with backlash alone, then when her numbers tank, swoop in and take all the credit and her supporters!"
The issue is not that her version of health Care is robust enough. The issue is in your own screenshot. She wants to do it in her THIRD YEAR. In politics, when you have a limited amount of political capital, doing something in your third year is like not doing it at all.   Think back to Obama's third year, Republicans came into office and he could never accomplish anything through congress again.  I support Warren, I'm voting for her because I have more confidence that she can work with Congressional Democrats to pass her agenda. I don't have that confidence with Bernie, Bernie will have to handle the majority of actions by executive order, and we've seen Trump upend all of Obama's executive orders. EOs aren't good enough.   I'm voting for Warren because she's younger. Bernie can do one term, but I have little faith he can do two.  I'm voting for her because I think her theory of politics is right, that corruption needs to be handled before anything else, or real progressive change isn't possible or limited.  But her position on healthcare makes me waiver. Because if she wants to do it in year 3 then the political reality is that it probably won't happen. It's a legitimate issue and concern.   In Washington presidents get a limited time to pass their agenda. Maybe Warren and Bernie can change that pattern but it's a bad bet.
For some fun throwback, here's one guy you might have heard of, some [skinny kid with a funny name as a proponent of single-payer health care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpAyan1fXCE)
(am a Sanders supporter with Warren as a very close second) I think that's a pretty good plan. It would prove it works without having to go full in at first.  Edit: and it would be a lot easier to get the "expand ACA" people to work on it
What can I say , she's a girl and she uses her talent, it's so offensive.  Worse, she is a girl who wants the credit for what she does, how much more crazy can be tolerated, I ask you ü§Ø .    /s.  ...  üò≠üôÑ, God, evolution üôÑ, sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be a smart female ape... Females are human too ‚úäüíó
[removed]
I talk with people who just don‚Äôt like her and I think it‚Äôs because she comes off too preachy instead of fiery in many of her debate performances. Fiery Warren they like. That‚Äôs who I liked when she first appeared on the daily show many moons ago. I think this lack of ‚Äòknowing your audience‚Äô is what has been costing her at the polls. I agree with her policies more than sanders but he‚Äôs got the fiery passion people are gravitating toward.
[removed]
I don't know how she can promise this any more definitely than Sanders. The problem with getting M4A is not the aggressiveness of the plan, it's getting the support to push it through.
Why does she want to fight twice for it? That doubles the chances of failing.
[removed]
because the second she got the least amount of heat on it, she backtracked and claimed it was just a "framework"
[deleted]
[removed]
She‚Äôs not getting rid of private healthcare though, right? That‚Äôs the big thing that differentiates the plans for me. I‚Äôve dealt with insurance and they are evil
[removed]
This is one of the many reasons I‚Äôve been all in on Warren from before she even declared. I like Bernie‚Äôs overall message and his big ideas, but I‚Äôm skeptical how much he would get done. Her plans are all pretty similar, but she seems to be much more pragmatic. Maybe Sanders would be, as well, if/when he‚Äôs elected, but I have so much more faith in Warren to get things done.   Another example that‚Äôs really important to me: student debt relief. Both candidates have a version of this. Warren‚Äôs plan eliminates almost all debt, up to a point. I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers, but I know the amount of relief starts to fade once household income reaches $100,000. Bernie‚Äôs plan is to just cancel all of it. The latter would benefit me more‚Äîmy wife and I combine to make just over $100,000, so my debt wouldn‚Äôt be erased entirely under Warren‚Äôs plan‚Äîbut Warren‚Äôs proposal seems far more likely to get passed.
I only wish she‚Äôd try to do this in the first 2 years.   History shows presidents typically lose congress after midterms, and if republicans control either chamber at that point it won‚Äôt get passed.
We have Joe Lieberman to thank for that üôÑ
Obama had 2 years with a dem controlled house and senate.  He could have passed a single payer bill.  He should have passed a single payer bill.  But he wanted bipartisan support - which he never got for anything in 8 years though not for a lack of trying on his part - AND the democrats were all over the place with there support.    It isn‚Äôt that he didn‚Äôt want a single payer bill.  He was fully capable of looking at every other modernized nation in world and identifying the solution like everyone else.  He wanted to be nice, and he wanted to play kumbya with the Republicans more.    That is on of the things I LOVE about Warren.  She wants to fix problems and understands it will be a fight.
People are demanding M4A because of Bernie's and now also Liz's movement. Obama had nothing to do with it.
She didn't walk it back, she clarified. I think people are just looking for excuses to attack her at this point
I spoke with someone over the weekend who said they were a Bernie supporter because they believed Elizabeth's plan to put people 50+ on Medicare right away would bankrupt the system, that they needed to add everyone all at once to get the younger people in there to cover the older people's costs. I was like... you do realize that if Bernie is able to pass his plan, he's planning to phase in 55+ year olds in the first year, 45+ in the second year, 35+ in the third, and so on? Warren's plan actually gets everyone covered earlier than Bernie does!  I got radio silence after that.
What really makes me wonder is... how do Bernie supporters think M4A will actually be applied? Not how it will end up being, but all the in-between. If you think he will pass it through EO in day one, what do you think will happen? Hospitals are just gonna be like oh we will just bill the government easy piecey? In that situation i‚Äôd see hospitals massively shutting down in a matter of months in the worst case, most likely it will go down the same path as Trump‚Äôs immigration ban, just getting boggled in court battles from some states. Like honestly that‚Äôs the spectrum of possibility I can see, but what do I know?   And then there are people who are just like ‚Äúnah don‚Äôt worry about it, it won‚Äôt pass, its just campaigning‚Äù... in which case that‚Äôs even worse for progressives. Like, when Obama got elected and not achieved all he promised, instead of realizing that you can‚Äôt get elected and at the same time fulfill the promises you made entirely (even Trump has this issue), people just went like well Obama was just a trickster. Meanwhile they are saying its fine, its just a campaign promise? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.  Edit - fixed a typo
‚Äúwaffled‚Äù  they are so used to Bernie never taking the second step of turning an idea into reality that they confuse it for ‚Äúwaffling‚Äù lol
I think the important point here is that she has continued to refine her plan/strategy as she has gone along. She has added a LOT of detail since the M4A plan came out, more so than any other candidate I think. I read the info within the first week and, at that time, her website essentially only included hyperlinks to letters from academics on the cost structure of the plan. These letters, by the way, seem to have been removed (but I digress).  I was among those that was surprised when she shifted the timeline/structure and thought it was a concession personally. I only recently revisited her site to see the new stuff. The lesson here is that not everyone is ‚Äúwillfully stupid‚Äù. It really is possible that people are trying to stay informed. Perhaps, it would be advisable to remind people to check for changes, as Warren is constantly making improvements. :)
Oblivious isn't the word and Bernie's not promising more. Liz knows what's going on. She gave them a warning to stop lying in the Nevada debate. Read between the lines:  >"His campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work," Warren said of Sanders. "And then his own advisers say that probably won‚Äôt happen anyway."  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/20/candidate-fights-nevada-debate
 Bernie has a plan though. He's going to add dental and vision healthcare to medicare, and drop the age of medicare from 65 to 55 the first year in office, then lower it in subsequent years until we're all covered. I'm not saying Bernie's plan is as fleshed out as Elizabeth Warren's, but he definitely has a plan.    Why do we continue to peddle this "no plan" lie? When Bernie gets the nom, it's going to hurt us so much more that we're anti-Bernie's healthcare instead of just pro Warren and pro Bernie's plan (even if we believe Warren has a better plan).
They‚Äôre not oblivious. They‚Äôre intentionally peddling misinformation and counting on ignorance to prevail.

This really is her best argument. M4A has proved a real vote getter for Bernie and Warren never pushed back on the idea she abandoned it (probably because she had people like Harry Reid in her ear telling her to be pragmatic). Plus going after him about the filibuster casts doubt on whether he can get *any* of his domestic agenda through.
I was in the Bernie camp until Warren announced. I left for that reason. Warren and her supporters are the kind of coalition I am honored and proud to be a part of. I‚Äôd be embarrassed honestly to call myself a Bernie Bro at this point. I‚Äôd be exhausted from constantly calling out the lies and even blatant sexism, homophobia, and racism. There is a subset that will resort to any tactics to win and I can‚Äôt deal with that shit.   I like Bernie‚Äôs ideology a lot. We‚Äôre pretty closely aligned. But approach and tone matters too.   PS, as far as him being more likely to win: Warren is now polling in 2nd and surging again, right before Super Tuesday. Vote for who you like more. That‚Äôs what primaries are for. She could still pull this off; it‚Äôs been done before (see Bill Clinton).
Removed: Rule 11.     Yes, hiding a rule 11 behind 4 sentences of light support for Warren, then a going down the list of another candidates talking points STILL counts as a rule 11.
It‚Äôs the FDR strategy- roll out a transition, create public demand and ease fears, win the midterms on the back of the popularity of the policy, pass it.   Admittedly there is a lot there that could go wrong, but it‚Äôs not an admission she‚Äôll never try. Bernie‚Äôs bill fails out of the gate because he won‚Äôt nuke the filibuster.
She explicitly states "**no later** than her third year" which to me reads that she wants it completed and finalized by then, not started.
I think it's actually an advantage she's going to move onto it in her third year.  That gives a chance for people to move on from whatever Republicans throw at it, like the death panels crap they did last time.  Giving people a chance to actually realize that health care for all is feasible and a good thing is important.  Remember how Mike Lee was caught saying "We need to repeal Obamacare before people realize they like it?"  Warren wants a chance to let the people get something so they can see they like it first.
So whose plan is better?
> Think back to Obama's third year,   To be fair, he had lost the House at that point and then 2 years later lost the Senate and if there is one thing the GOP is good at, it's obstructing the govt from functioning.  The Senate map is better for Democrats in the 3rd year (2022) than it is now because there are a lot of Republicans up for reelection in 2020 *and* 2022, so a majority or larger majority is more likely post-2022 election.  Also, given that younger/more progressive people are more active in politics than ever before ([about a 14pt increase from 2014 to 2018 in people under 45](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/04/behind-2018-united-states-midterm-election-turnout.html) compared to an 8.5pt increase for over 45) that bodes well for increasing progressive members of both the House and Senate.  She has a much better chance of passing M4A (and other progressive legislation) in her 3rd year.
Should point out that the only Republican POTUS she voted for was Ford, and she was only registered GOP from 1991-6 because she wanted to vote in a closed primary for Specter and then changed it after she went to D.C. for the first time to fight the bankruptcy bill.   ‚ÄòShe was a Reaganite during the AIDS crisis!‚Äô is a nonsense attack and I see it a lot
40 years of progress!  We're not trying to out-chapo anybody. But we do have plans to get M4A, a nickel and dime at a time.
1) It‚Äôs not an attempt to out-progressive anyone, but by my standards, Warren is just as progressive if not more. They‚Äôre progressive in different ways outside of economics (Bernie more so in FP and Warren more so on social issues).   2) This is about countering blatant misinformation that Warren doesn‚Äôt want full M4A or doesn‚Äôt want it as fast.   3) Bernie has been saying the same stuff for 40 years but hasn‚Äôt accomplished much. To me, that‚Äôs a weakness: a typical politician who knows what to say and how to brand himself but never gets it done.
We‚Äòre not voting on what someone‚Äôs position was in the 1980‚Äôs. We‚Äôre voting on their position today.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about trying to out-progressive anybody, but about who has the better chance of delivering results right now. Being ‚Äúfor‚Äù something for the longest period of time isn‚Äôt a measure of success.
Removed: Rule 11
‚ÄúPreachy‚Äù = ‚Äúwoman‚Äù
> he‚Äôs got the fiery passion  Does he? To me it just seems like grouchy yelling.  I will vote for Sanders if he wins the primary but lately he is becoming a distant second choice instead of a close one.
Sanders is winning because of branding and it‚Äôs so frustrating. She‚Äôs got way more substance and capacity to enact her plans.
Are you on here to stir things up, are you on here because you‚Äôre supporting Warren, or for another reason? Genuinely asking, because your post history is...suspicious
Removed: rule 4 & 11
This is why the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù elections matter too.
Getting a public option acting as a transition plan is something that is significantly more popular across the board then M4A as of right now. Every Dem and likely even some Republicans in the senate would be willing to back a public option and get it passed. You have around half of Republican voters that are for a public option, and the older crowd (the crowd that votes the most), are the ones benefiting heavily from her Public option. The younger crowd, will have lost their auto-coverage once they turn 18, and so you'll have a younger audience, that is clamoring for M4A, and will be pivotal in making the gains in the senate in 2022 that we need to pass M4A.
The theory is that in the first 100 days she signs an EO for some of the most needy. Then, she signs anti-corruption laws and abolished the filibuster. Then, right after midterms, after a blue wave, we have the support and she signs M4A: public option into law. Everyone is covered. However, some people are paying extra for private coverage that doesn‚Äôt include more benefits. So slowly they move over to the public option because, even if they‚Äôre politically against it, they‚Äôre paying for it and it just makes financial sense.   Then, we have the support for M4A. This transition will just make sense once we get the public option and public opinion will turn much more favorable towards it.   Bernie‚Äôs plan is force it through Congress with no compromise and no anticorruption laws or changes to the filibuster and pray it works.
It does not. This is just a Chapo talking point
Because she knows full M4A will not pass in the current system. So she wants to fight for a public option first because that can immediately help people and then she can get a more favorable senate in 2022 and get full M4A done.
Yeah because talking about it clearly hurt her in the polls, so it‚Äôs a bad campaign strategy to talk about it. She‚Äôs not going to peel off M4A supporters from Bernie and she‚Äôs hurting herself with moderates by talking about it.
Better than AOC, who has completely [capitulated](https://www.axios.com/aoc-medicare-for-all-public-option-bernie-sanders-6f94493e-96d3-4329-8c29-d17891d43fc9.html) to the public option. And if you disbelieve her, I'm sure, any day now, you'll ask St. Bernard how much his plan will cost?  Not even a [couple weeks ago](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bernie-sanders-slammed-how-finance-pay-medicare-for-all-healthcare-2020-1-1028860817) could Bernie answer this‚Ä¶  >O‚ÄôDONNELL: You don‚Äôt know how much your plan costs?  >SANDERS: You don‚Äôt know. Nobody knows. This is impossible to predict.  lol  She actually has a multi-stage plan to get to M4A. Bernie has nothing but a plan to do a rally in Kentucky. Wake up from your fever dream.
Bernie‚Äôs protest bill was absolutely a framework.
go away
I hope Sanders supporters understand why so many people don't like him and start figuring out better ways to build a coalition.
At year 3, yes she is. That‚Äôs what full M4A means: Single payer, the bill she supported when Bernie proposed it (as a protest admittedly rather than a serious proposal).
Removed for Rule 7 (do not spread false or misleading information).  Warren's plan (which is on her website) introduces full M4A legislation in year three, a year earlier than it would be implemented under Bernie in the unrealistically optimistic case it gets passed immediately.  Don't come to our sub and lie about our candidate.
Also, Warren's plan for student loans does it largely Day 1 with executive powers iirc.
$100K household income really isn‚Äôt that much.... that‚Äôs still an incredibly unfair and messed up education system, shamefull in the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù world.
She won't have the votes to abolish the filibuster in the next Congress. She'll fight to get those votes elected in the midterm, and I think if anyone who's running can accomplish that, it's Warren.
I'd argue that her approach makes more sense in the context of her first priorities - corruption and election reform.  A Congressional majority(and one willing to pass progressive policy) coming out of the midterms is much more likely in the scenario where we get rid of the voter suppression tactics that Republicans have been using first.  If we want sustainable majorities, if we want to win more than one big fight per presidency, we need that reform to lay the groundwork.  Warren understands that, and no other candidate is willing to engage with that reality.
Fuck Joe Lieberman
This makes the assumption that by having Democratic control that you automatically get what you want. Unfortunately, this isn't true, there are and were plenty of Dems that would not want to go that far.  Edit: silly auto correct a word.
> Obama had 2 years with a dem controlled house and senate  Try four months  > The truth....then....is this: Democrats had ‚Äútotal control‚Äù of the House of Representatives from 2009-2011, 2 full years. Democrats, and therefore, Obama, had ‚Äútotal control‚Äù of the Senate from September 24, 2009 until February 4, 2010. A grand total of 4 months.  https://www.beaconjournal.com/akron/pages/when-obama-had-total-control-of-congress
Your take on the ACA is completely revisionist.  He never had GOP support, ever, for passage of the ACA, and he didn't seriously pursue it.  The House passed single payer, the reason it was dropped was because they could not get enough *Democrats* on board to pass the ACA with single payer still attached.  Too many conservative/Blue Dog Dems (Lieberman (Ind.), Nelson from NE, for example) would have rather tanked the ACA entirely than have the public option included.  It never had anything to do with Republicans.
You also need to understand that there is a huge difference between 2008 and today. Back then it was EXPECTED that something that big got bipartisan support. It was pre-tea party isolationist politics. I don‚Äôt blame Obama for wanting to do what at the moment was the right thing to do.
> Obama had 2 years with a dem controlled house and senate.  He really didn't.
[deleted]
This is completely untrue. He tried to get support for single payer at first but realized he didn't have the votes in the senate.
Obama only had a [filibuster-proof majority in the Senate for four months](https://www.beaconjournal.com/article/20120909/NEWS/309099447). The Senate passed the ACA under the wire in the last days of 2009 that Democrats had control of the Senate.
[Obama never really had a filibuster-proof majority, and could not have passed a single payer bill without Republican support.](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_1929869?guccounter=1)
Bernie was able to run on M4A in 2016, because by then enough people had experienced and liked Medicare and because too many people had been burned by greedy insurance companies.   But I agree that Bernie is the one who made M4A the focal point of this election.
Oh 100%. I think also that most people don‚Äôt actually wanna hear the nuance of these policy discussions , they just want the sausage
> Not how it will end up being, but all the in-between. If you think he will pass it through EO in day one, what do you think will happen?  Look, what part of protesting in front of Mitch McConell's house is confusing you???   It's the way everything will get done b/c then Mitch'll "have to" compromise!* /s  (*But seriously, one of his supporters said protests in KY would "force" McConnell and other senators to work with Sanders b/c they would be worried for their "safety" and "gated communities" otherwise (no joke!). They think this is Downton Abbey or some shit.)
I've been asking Bernie supporters what they're looking for in a candidate, and a significant number of them respond, simply, "revolution." They have no favorite policy proposals they want to discuss, they just want to tear things down.
Oh don‚Äôt you know? Bernie has a Movement‚Ñ¢Ô∏è so obviously it‚Äôs getting passed. How? He‚Äôs got The Movement‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.   Uh.... yeah. The Movement‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I guess.  No more questions please.
> Not how it will end up being, but all the in-between  It goes through a public option transition that is built into the bill. The (simplified) difference between the Warren plan and the Sanders plan is this: Sanders wants to take it all on in one fell swoop/fight while Warren wants to take it up with two different fights one after the other.
Medicare is currently the largest insurance provider in the country.  Every one age 65+ is enrolled and uses their insurance every day.  You can imagine that if they simply allowed 55+ people to enroll not much would change.  Now what if you just let everybody enroll in medicare?  Wouldn't me using my medicare just be the same thing that happens when my grandmother does it?
I spoke to someone this week who said they didn't like Warren because she had to many ideas, and that was "pie in the sky," that she should pick 2 or 3 things she wanted to get done and stick to that.
It'll be so hilarious if he wins and has to present a realistic plan that can pass and his fans see him "waffling", or more realistically, sad when nothing gets done because he refuses anything resembling compromise.
I agree completely and I think it‚Äôs time for her to stop saying read between the lines and say it bluntly before it‚Äôs too late.
Yeah, my pedestal for AOC is broken.
They said ‚Äúno plan to enact...‚Äù   He has no plan for funding and no plan for getting the bill passed. The actual bill is bare bones as well, and would need to be greatly expounded upon. Like by a factor of 10 at least, with specifics.   Warren got in ‚Äútrouble‚Äù with the Bernie crowd for rightly calling it a framework. It‚Äôs 100 pages. Compare that to a real healthcare bill, the PPACA (which was far less comprehensive a reform), which was 2200 pages.
I agree with what you're saying but with our rule 4 policy we consider some of the nicknames given to other candidates a violation of rule 4. If you edit those out I'll approve your comment and delete mine.
This is too rich. Come out as progressive? She was The Senator to fight the banks and Wall Street Elite when. They were getting appointed by the Obama Admin, where was Bernie? Where was Bernie when the CFPB was needed and her nomination was blocked? She has been a progressive and firebrand this whole time, no permission needed.  If she is needed so much, she should be President.
Warren is first presidential candidate to sign the pledge to stop the KeystoneXL pipeline, and restore a climate test for all energy projects!
Warren impresses me. She is on top of everything and already has a plan!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
You'd think Jay Inslee would be all about this!
This is what I show to people when they say " you only support Warren because she's a woman!".   No, I support Warren because she actually has a plan, she gets shit done, and I think she'd be better than all other candidates running. Though, I respect the other democrat candidates running as well and I do recognize that alot of them have good ideas as well, I just think Warren is better.
Because Russia isn't the only country that has devastating kompromat on Trump.
Is this something that can be stopped via executive order?  I remember Obama running into some roadblocks....
Obama shaking rn
Kind of a little disingenuous, don't you think.  I'm glad Warren signed yet another pledge - but other folks have been out there, on the record, against KeystoneXL from the beginning (like Bernie Sanders).
Warren defended the workers - not the protestors - of the Keystone XL pipeline when it actually mattered and never went to go and actually visit Standing Rock.  Eh but now she signs a pledge when running for President and in the public's eye more.  Totes reliable and trustoworthy /s
So Warren's Campaign pitch to me is what? Learn to program? Are there Democrat alternatives that want support my job?
He's signed as well. So has Bernie (see their Twitter feed).
He would for sure, but I don't think his campaign has made it to Nebraska. Inslee, if he drops out, would be a good choice for Commerce Secretary or an equivalent cabinet position.
[deleted]
do you ask them if they only support <their candidate/white house occupant> because he's a man?
[deleted]
It's not disingenuous. They have a pledge that she signed first, that Jay Inslee and Bernie signed the same day. They tweeted that out when she had just signed, before the others had as well. It's simply an announcement of that fact, and the others received similar tweets.
This was Warren's statement on Standing Rock:  U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren December 4, 2016 ¬∑  I don‚Äôt know how anyone could watch the news and not be horrified by what‚Äôs happening at Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota.  For months, the Standing Rock Sioux and thousands of others have opposed a pipeline that many believe risks contaminating the tribe‚Äôs water supply. What have they faced in response? Attack dogs. Rubber bullets. Tear gas. Water hoses in freezing temperatures. A 21-year-old graduate of Williams College in Massachusetts had her arm nearly destroyed. And last week, the governor directed state and local agencies to refuse emergency assistance as a way to expel the tribe and their "water protector" supporters.  The Standing Rock Sioux are not animals to be corralled ‚Äì they are human beings. Good, passionate human beings who have stood together in the middle of a North Dakota blizzard this past week, and stood together for many weeks before, to fight for what they believe in. They should be treated with respect and basic human decency.  The construction workers and laborers at Standing Rock are also human beings ‚Äì and they weren‚Äôt the ones to decide where to build this pipeline. They are good, hard-working people who are just trying to do their jobs. They also should be treated with respect and basic human decency.  The fact is, we need a country where all of our children can safely drink the water and where we move away from dirty fossil fuels and build more sustainable green energy solutions. We also need good jobs and respect for our workers. All of these things are true. It is both/and, not either/or.  Time is running out. Patience has worn thin. Nerves have frayed. Every day brings a chance for escalation of the violence and more injuries. The Obama Administration should step up now and work with the Army Corps of Engineers to find an alternate route to this pipeline and ways to address the concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux. Yes, there may be more work to do and it may take more money, but we need to act in good faith, deescalate this violence, and find a solution. https://standwithstandingrock.net/senator-elizabeth-warren-makes-statement-standing-rock/
What is your job? Ideally, America's energy industry will move to renewables.  You could potentially move to building solar and wind farms, or even hydrodams.
Warren's green manufacturing plan creates over million good paying jobs.
I imagine you're in oil drilling?  Or pipeline laying?  There's a huge [infrastructure/housing package](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/my-housing-plan-for-america-20038e19dc26) amongst Sen. Warren's many [worker-focused proposals](https://elizabethwarren.com/issues#rebuild-the-middle-class) that would require pipefitters, welders, heavy equipment operators as well as framers and the rest of the housing construction industry - I know it's not exactly the same as oil pipelines, but there are transferable skills, and they are in an industry that can survive without heavy subsidy.  I know it's not the same as keeping the exact same job, but it's something positive.  What do you think?
Whatever you would you say to the thousands of hard-working, blue collar citizens in the asbestos mining industry who had to find new jobs. What would you tell them?
Secretary of Energy maybe
or Governor of Washington!   Sorry, I know it's selfish, I just really like my Governor and want him to stay in WA - he's done a lot of good here.  I'd obviously be thrilled if he was head of the EPA or Commerce.
If it's ridiculous and offensive to say women only support Warren because she's a woman, it's also ridiculous and offensive to say women only supported Hillary for that reason.  There might be some for which it was a factor, but I'm sure even they all gave it more thought than "hey, she's a she!"
"The Obama Administration should step up now and work with the Army Corps of Engineers to find an alternate route to this pipeline and ways to address the concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux."   - Warren on 12-4-16.

Geothermal power involves a lot of the same drilling techniques as oilfield exploitation.
I think I would want an actual nuclear scientist in that position.
Isn't Inslee term limited?

That would make a lot of sense. But I also think there is value in having a politician in that role who could be trusted to take the advice of scientists. But I see the value of having a scientist there. I'm split.
WA doesn't term limit
@ewarren is 3rd in delegates nationally. She has raised more than $6,000,000 in the past 1.5 weeks. In Virginia on Thursday, 4,000 people showed up and we had to have an overflow room for the overflow room. Frustrated this isn‚Äôt covered? Me too. What can you do? Talk about it.
My daughter and I were in the overflow of the overflow, which was basically about 300 people standing outside in the cold, but she came out for about 5 mins to welcome us, urge us to fight for big structural change, and to volunteer.  We drove an hour, waited outside for an hour, and it was still worth it :)
Also, pivot to why she's the best candidate after shutting down the horse race argument. We don't want to live in "electability", we want to live in dream big, fight hard, and win.
This seems like the right place to talk about it. Its frustrating as hell.
When a man doesn't "get enough coverage" despite underperforming it's "blindness" and a conspiracy.  When a woman doesn't get coverage despite outperforming every metric set its business as usual.

Meanwhile on NPR they‚Äôre ignoring Warren in favor of Mar-a-liasson‚Äôs Bloomberg advocacy.
My hope os that with a strong showing in Nevada a comeback story for warren can start to happen. The media loves to write those.

Nothing to see here, just a "myth". Complaining about exposure on a political sub where 75% of the frontpage for that past two months have been fluff pieces from Bernie's personal blog Jacobin and the Guardian? Lol, I guess we haven't reached peak Bernie-Brietbart stage yet.  My personal favorites are the posts that pop up here which are really just negs: "Bernie supporter here, I love Warren, I'd vote for her if she knelt at the alter and promised to be a weak ass VP because my bros love that idea, it's so woke!"   Must be fun living in that bubble. So *nimble* they are in it.
Anyone else want feisty Warren at the Vegas debate?  I want her to continue being the unity candidate, but I think she needs to go on the offense.  It is what gets her news coverage and people seem to respond well to it.  I suspect she'll go hard at Bloomberg of course, so will every other candidate.  Lol, I know it will never happen, but I would love all the candidates to say, "We are blue no matter who, but every other candidate on this stage is leagues better than Bloomberg." With that said, she should take a few jabs at the other candidates.  The jabs should be policy related, of course, and hopefully regarding less controversial weaknesses.  I would love her to go after Biden on bankruptcy.  I think her going after Buttigieg's issues with race relations as mayor was her most discussed/popular moment at the last debate.  Also, I think she should go after Sanders, with something like  them sharing similar goals, but his lack of pragmatism and reasonable plans are going to hinder accomplishing progressive goals, ex. AOC's backpedaling on M4A.  The media loves drama, sadly, so I think Warren going on the attack is her best way to get some more media coverage.
[removed]
Hell yes! It's amazing how the media has written her off for some reason. My guess is she doesn't engage in the petty BS. In fact, I think the last time she got significant coverage was when she and Bernie argued on stage after she called him out on his behavior on a hot mic. Of course she got the more negative press - can't imagine why.   Anyway, keep fighting the good fight! LFG!
I have high hopes for Nevada.  Caucuses measure voter enthusiasm to a larger extent than primaries.  With the Sanders supporters fiasco going after union leaders demonstrating that he can be too polarizing to an already weary democratic base\*; Buttigieg and Klobuchar polling badly with POC; and Biden supporters lacking enthusiasm; there is a real chance for Warren to shine.  I think the results are going to be a bit more like Iowa; minus the overwhelming white vote (and messed up tallying); thus pushing out Buttigieg.  This means we might have a Sanders and Warren as 1st and 2nd.  Warren could even conceivably pass Sanders as the consensus candidate for the others who aren't viable.  If this happens, the media can no longer ignore her and should start talking about her as the viable alternative to Sanders.  I think there are A LOT of voters out there who like progressive ideas, but find Sanders a bridge too far; they will find a home with Warren.  Note: I haven't accounted for Bloomberg buying his way in.  I hope he doesn't end up a factor. And won't be viable.  \**I refuse to get in a bickering match with the myriad of Sanders supporters on this issue.  If you respond in kind, I will just ignore your comment.  I'm not in the mood for the lurkers here who aren't Warren supporters*
[removed]
Can we cross post these points to other subreddits and sites?   Make sure we are emphasizing she is the best candidate for the job too.
I feel she is in a difficult spot. She has progressives credentials, but to attack Sanders (for those votes) is tough and can potentially backfire. Going for moderate votes is tough because it is split 4 ways (Biden/Pete/Amy/Bloomberg) not counting her.
[removed]

Welcome to Bernie world. I wish the two campaigns were not antagonistic. Yes, I am a Bernie supporter, but Warren is no. 2, and it is a very long distance to no. 3. Bloomberg is not on my list.
[removed]
I was out there, too, absolutely worth it even though I just stood outside for an hour and couldn't get in, wish I could have been inside but hey. It's a good problem to have
Damn straight.
I'll say! I love how the narrative has turned to where raising 6 million in less than 2 weeks is considered "struggling". It's been a very annoying week and a half...
>This seems like the right place to talk about it  because talking about it on Twitter will get you doxxed :/
As a Bernie supporter, I agree that coverage has been unfair to Warren. There is an inherent bias in the media toward progressivism. She's absolutely my 2nd pick, and I would be thrilled to vote for her in the general. Cant really say that about the other candidates right now.
That's what I'm hoping too.  Caucuses measure voter enthusiasm; Biden doesn't have it; Nevada isn't white enough to bring Klobuchar and Buttigieg to the levels they got in Iowa and New Hampshire.  That leaves Sanders and Warren (and hopefully not Bloomberg).  Of those two, I hope that the supporters for the nonviable candidates see Warren as the viable alternative.  That could even propel her past Sanders.  But even if she gets second place; that should change the media narrative and get voters to start looking at her as the unity candidate.
>... "Bernie supporter here, I love Warren, I'd vote for her if she knelt at the alter and promised to be a weak ass VP because my bros love that idea, it's so woke!"  The impersonation is uncanny.
I'm largely pretty amused to see the narrative forming around Bernie being treated like the frontrunner in the media. It largely being that Bernie got too big that even the corporate elite media can no longer even deny Bernie coverage.  It can't possibly be that the media is not some synchronized cabal that didn't treat Bernie like the frontrunner, because up to this point, he never was. And now that he is, the media is just doing their jobs and acting accordingly.   I'm not saying mainstream coverage of Bernie has been perfect. Far from it. But I'd largely argue that Bernie was treated commensurate to his status in the race. In 2016, he was a long shot that got beaten in a landslide. He was treated as such. In 2020, he was a possible favorite but not the frontrunner until he got to where he is today, and the coverage reflects that.   But no, instead there's always some conspiracy theory. Reminds me of the All Powerful Deep State conspiracies. The Deep State hates Trump but couldn't stop his election. The Media hates Bernie but nonetheless still covers him as the frontrunner.
[removed]
What bothers me are the Bernie supporters whose sole purpose in coming to a Warren sub is to shill for Bernie, but when I confront them about it, they claim that have the right to ~~suck up all the oxygen in the room~~ "engage" because "Warren is their second choice".  So?  That's because they hate all the candidates; but hate Warren slightly less.  That doesn't justify brigading this sub.  They don't see that they are acting entitled; Warren supporters don't brigade Bernie subs.  What does that say about us in contrast to them?  \*Yes, yes, I KNOW it's not ALL Bernie supporters.
> Must be fun living in that bubble. So *nimble* they are in it.  i see what you did there. üëâüòâüëâ
I don't see any actual rough count for Bernie's Denver crowd. It just says thousands everywhere. Sanders is most popular with the people who use Reddit so it makes sense that would be upvoted more. Plus he's currently the frontrunner.  AOC is not Bernie Sanders or running for president. Personally I was quite disappointed to hear her backpedaling.  The complaints about coverage are squared mostly on CNN and MSNBC. Warren is the second choice for most Sanders supporters because they're the closest ideologically, but I think most Sanders supporters see Sanders as having the better record and political instincts. It has nothing to do with your bizarre characterization of Sanders supporters as misogynists.  I'm not really sure how you can be angry that people come here because they're interested in how you guys view the world and the race and at the same time say they're living in a bubble. I understand your frustration, but I don't think you should be taking it out on people who are presumably closest to you on the political spectrum.
Removed for dividing Democrats.  Please do not use that divisive term on this sub.  Be more specific and descriptive.
[removed]
Amazing isn't it?  Bernie makes a comment about whether or not he believes a woman can defeat Trump; Warren is asked about it and tells the truth; instead of coming clean and putting his comments in perspective; Bernie just denies it.  Warren suffers the consequences for not using her time to dig Bernie out of the hole; Bernie's support goes up. Her support goes down. Once again a woman is being made responsible for a man's words.  If that isn't a microcosm of gender politics, I don't know what it.
I stumbled upon E_S_S a few weeks go and I swear jumping between these two subs daily is the only thing that helps keep me sane
Isn't that a balm!   Thank you--I needed that bc I feel like I'm drowning in a certain candidate's supporters.
Honest to god I've been holding off posting in that subreddit so long, but every week i spend debating "as a sanders supporter" here in the *official Elizabeth Warren candidate subreddit* i come closer and closer to making it my main political discussion hub.

Seems like we are living in two different worlds, not sure where you have seen the Warren campaign or supporters being antagonistic.
I've seen Bernie supporters (not all of them, I know) slander Warren's reputation and good name and basically try to paint her as a corporate centrist establishment shill for months and months.  I resent it.  I resent it a lot.  One of his supporters who was doing this admitted to me that his motivation was to help Bernie; and he thought that disparaging Warren did that.  **It's the scorched earth tactics that I object to**.  Not that some voters prefer Bernie over Warren.
Same.  If not for Sanders, I'd be backing Warren 100%. There's no other option beyond those two, and unfortuantely for the latter, I don't see a path to the nomination for her at this point. In the end, I think she should've run as more of a centrist and capitalized on Biden's collapse. If anything, that's why Amy is still in it and surging. She bided her time and waited for Biden to fail. Without Buttigieg in the race, I think Klobuchar would be the frontrunner now.   At this point, I see a Sanders-Klobuchar compromise and her being the VP nominee. As much as I'd prefer Warren, I don't want to lose her seat in the Senate.
Removed for Rule 11.
It‚Äôs because Klobuchar has raised over 12 million since the NH debate‚Äî for reference that‚Äôs more than she‚Äôs ever raised in a single quarter.  Big Money Donors are hunting for an alternative to Biden. Now they have Amy and Pete. Add that to Bernie‚Äôs surge in fundraising as well‚Äî a relative over performance in fundraising by a fantastic candidate who was unfairly counted out, simply isn‚Äôt good enough for the media to cover fairly.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs out of cash and needs to drop out‚Äù is a very annoying and frequent line of attack
Bernie actually does best with women of color and worst with white males. Quit with the sexist smears please.
I mean, I don't know, I think Bernie was ignored for a long time and by most in the media. There definitely was a level of unfairness to it, which he certainly didn't deserve after succeeding as much as he did.  That being said (btw I'm a Warren supporter too): I think it was to his benefit. Let's be real: Clinton treated the guy way too gingerly, and so have all the 2020 candidates (except maybe Pete, but even that's a stretch) because they're terrified his voters won't come around to vote for them in the general election. Bernie has so much baggage, which has literally never, ever been aired, and I think it's because no on really ever took him seriously. Even now, when he's leading, they're still sensationalizing his rivals rather than giving him the glowy underdog frontrunner treatment they gave Warren from August to October.  I definitely think that a Bernie blackout is real lmao. I just think that it helps him-- something I hate, because he and Pete are the least vetted contenders. I think it's because people think the "socialist" label is enough so they don't bother, but it'd be a mistake to let that continue.
Ikr?  It disturbs me how willing some on the left are to trade in crackpot conspiracy theories.  We are supposed to be better than this.
> In 2016, he was a long shot that got beaten in a landslide. He was treated as such.   I don't know  that 12% when all is said and done is a "landslide". But even during the campaign, there was a lack of coverage, like there was a lack of coverage for candidates like Warren today.
Also, I took a look at the Warren post and while it didn't have anywhere near as many comments, it didn't look like a controversial post. If anything, all the downvoted comments were people criticizing Warren
Based on the headline. Frankly, it was a recent example, if it comes to that, there's plenty more out there...
>  but I think most Sanders supporters see Sanders as having the better record and political instincts.  They do but there's no evidence of it. He's had 30 years in Congress to get things done; instead he can barely build a coalition.  Meanwhile, Warren came in to help Congress address the financial crisis and developed and oversaw the creation of an entirely new agency without even being elected yet.  Whose "instincts" actually brought change to fruition?  > It has nothing to do with your bizarre characterization of Sanders supporters as misogynists.  Why is it bizarre? Because you don't see it? Because you don't understand it?  How about don't tell us what we're seeing isn't true just bc it doesn't make sense to *you*?  Ask any woman if  "man and woman express a conflicting view of a situation but only woman pays with her reputation and gets dragged through the mud with liar epithet" sounds familiar to *her*.
AOC isn‚Äôt backpedaling. She‚Äôs being realistic.

After Review, decision reversed.
And I'm sick of this bullshit response.  There are plenty of civil Bernie supporters, but it's outright lying to deny that there is a legion of bad actor cult-like Bernie Bros using MAGA tactics to quash discussion or consideration of other candidates through aggression, harassment, intimidation, and brigading.  When finally called out on it, the campaign talked out of both sides of its mouth, with the candidate giving a token "don't do that" while sending surrogates out with marching orders to continue with more of the same.  I'm sick and tired of being demanded by Bernie Bros *in this sub*  that I bow down and swear fealty to Bernie because less than 1% of the country voted him ahead of Warren.  I'm sick and tired of getting PMs saying things like "if you don't support Bernie you hate women and people of color."  And I'm incredibly sick and tired of Bernie Bros coming here and using Bernie Bro tactics to try to a gaslight me about your Bernie Bro existence!
You do realize your toxic posts against democrats in CTH are public? No one buys your unity charade.
I don't think anyone denies that Bernie has women or POC supporting him, but pretending that he doesn't have a very vocal contingent that harass people on twitter is pure gas-lighting. Call them whatever you want, they exist and the fact that they lean into this behavior is not helpful at all.
I don't think every supporter is a "Bernie Bro^(tm)". If you are trying to say that every one of Bernie's supporters is an internet troll who has been harassing us for the better part of a year, then you are not doing a whole lot for his movement.     Bernie has many clear headed, respectful, and kind supporters.     He also has a contingent of people who have harassed me and others for a very long time.     I would personally use a different word to describe those two groups. I don't understand why you would want to lump them both together.
You don't scroll down to the bottom of any other candidate's posts, do you?   A Bernio Bro only gets defensive when they are one. True Berners knock that shit down with the rest of us and don't take umbrage, because they have the emotional and intellectual maturity to understand that they have a common enemy with the rest of the progressive movement. Too bad there's a shortage of them lately.
That's why I switched to Bernie Brigade.  I firmly believe women are just as capable of being horrible trolls as men.
Yep! Watching the whole thing unfold was infuriating and so depressingly familiar.  I‚Äôm repeatedly amazed at the way people treat Warren. She‚Äôs not only the best choice in the race but arguably one of the best choices, period. But people are like, ‚Äúsmart, principled Senator with a clear track record of cleaning up corruption and an even clearer plan for the future? ...but can she juggle? Then maybe I‚Äôd vote for her...‚Äù
Have you seen the posts about the catch and kill tactics they use for articles?  Stuff is absolutely wild. I come here for good vibes and inspiration while I volunteer and there for sanity checks and catharsis lol, because sometimes I definitely feel like the rest of Reddit has lost its mind
What's the sub?  It appears that the parent comment was removed by the moderator so I don't see the full name of the sub you stumbled upon.
Honestly...this account is an alt I use only there because I just don't want to deal with getting harassed on my main account.  It's getting to a ridiculous point. Nice to blow off steam
I had to do it to keep my sanity when even the subreddit of my own candidate keeps being encroached upon by people wanting to aggressively defend/promote their candidate across the whole Reddit universe when they have like 6 subreddits for themselves. If this is how they think they‚Äôre going to convert voters, it‚Äôs for sure not working for me.
Straight up my main account posts here all the time but has a bit too much identifying info so that's why I split it up lol.
Fair enough!
Didn't advocate for another specific candidate. Just a bit of friendly advice from another progressive who's been in this community's shoes. Good luck, team Warren.
There was something Nate Silver posted about this problem right after NH. There were a bunch of news networks which basically had the narrative "Headline new: Amy surges into 3rd; second biggest news: Pete second; third biggest: Sanders wins NH". The media doesn't care if a candidate is good or in a solid 3rd place or anything; they care about horseraces and exciting things. Similar to why they kept showing Trump stuff.   Sad thing is that this US news coverage isn't even the most biased news I have seen recently...
Just reading the words "she needs to drop out" almost made me reflexively downvote your comment. There are so many bad-faith actors spamming that across social media and it's infuriating.

lol "sexist"
You're displaying exactly the blindness everyone else in this thread is talking about. Congrats on being a farce.
only because the majority of white males are republicans.
To be honest, I'm kind of terrified of the kind of material the right wing has and will use (obviously unfairly) against Sanders and that it will work and we get 4 more years of Trump.  For that reason, I want the other candidates and the media to properly vet Sanders.  We need to find out now, if he has the ability to withstand harsh vetting, before it's too late and he is the nominee and we are taken by surprise.  Things like he spent his youth living in a Kibbutz that swore allegiance to Joseph Stalin; even swung their flag at half mast when he died.  Or that Sanders spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union.  You or I might roll our eyes over this and accept that it's unfair; but what about the average less informed voter?  Are they going to wonder if Sanders is a "communist" in sheep's clothing?  Particularly as he often shouts about "revolution"?  I'm worried that there is too much baggage to be dragged out that no one is talking about now; so that we can see if Sanders has the ability to fight back and come out ahead or whether he isn't equipped for withstanding the criticism.
One thing that you need to put in perspective is that Bernie did as well as he did in 2016 because of caucuses.  Because caucuses are inherently undemocratic; they are typically about only 10% of the vote that you might get in a primary.  So it measures voter enthusiasm; but it does not measure voter support in general.  Had we not had so many states running caucuses in 2016; he wouldn't have gotten the delegates that he did.  Instead, it's quite possible that Hillary Clinton would have won those states.  For example:  North Dakota has a caucus; Bernie crushed it, not even close; South Dakota had a primary, Hillary won it narrowly.  Same demographic, different ways of voting.  Fortunately this time around, the DNC has reduced the caucuses to only 4 in the states (not including territories):  Iowa, Nevada; North Dakota; and Wyoming.  Low delegate states.  Want to guess what Bernie supporters are saying?  That it's a conspiracy against Sanders by the DNC; instead of what it actually is: a fairer process that increases voter participation.  Every time a Bernie supporter brings up voter suppression in the democratic nomination process in 2016 (because of closed primaries vs. open primaries and registration deadlines), I always bring up the caucus system.  For some inexplicable reason (/s); they don't usually respond back.
what was the upvote ratio on the post itself?
https://www.cpr.org/2020/02/16/bernie-sanders-draws-more-than-11000-to-denver-rally/  They had 11,000...
Just as realistic when Warren created an entire plan based on political realities? Just as realistic when Warren got destroyed by the Berners for giving an inch? I'm sure you'll be hashtagging AOC with a snake any day now...
She‚Äôs playing down expectations and getting the idea that m4a isn‚Äôt gonna happen out there so it‚Äôs not a surprise later.
Sure, but you don't say that. If you were haggling over a price you don't allude to the fact that you understand you paying more is more realistic. It seemed Obama wanted a public option going into office and even though he was elected with Dems controlling both houses what we eventually got was Romneycare.   If the idea is compromise is necessary even among Democrats then the middle ground between M4A and what we have currently is better than the middle ground between a public option and what we have now. All I'm saying is that in all cases it's dumb to tip your hand like that.

Well put. They‚Äôre still spamming posts to *cancel Chuck Todd* because he referenced another article highlighting similarities between certain self-proclaimed Bernie Bros and early supporters of Hitler.

Lmao I was at an Austin barnstorm for Bernie recently (friend dragged me) and I found it particularly hilarious when this white dude had the sheer audacity to call me  (brown and proud) a "race traitor" (no, I'm not kidding, these were his exact words) for supporting Warren over Bernie.
They exist for every candidate, though. Of course Sanders will have more - he is more popular among that demographic. It is just numbers.  More bad actors when you have more people that support you on the platform. Doesn't mean that every candidate doesn't have them, just that more exist because that specific one is more popular.
[And we should all remember that there is still meddling going on.](https://youtu.be/GYIgmua-J7o)  Not saying every pushy person online isn‚Äôt an actual voter, but we can‚Äôt forget that there are people online‚Äîyes, from other countries‚Äîwho are trying to divide us.

What, no horrible insults? No swears? No attacks on me, my family, or my life?  God, I love Warren supporters. =D
So we're not even the most biased? Exceptionalism is an illusion.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad faith actors. I think it‚Äôs legit Bernie supporters. For a lot of them this is their first election they‚Äôve ever participated in regardless of age. They don‚Äôt understand the process and they‚Äôve been a bit radicalized.
i've sometimes referred to them as the Bernie Brigade, because all they do is brigade pro-warren threads to shit all over her & her supporters.
Lol
I love how they gloss over that.
I share this fear. A Sanders nomination would be a gift to the GOP. But when I bring up his baggage to his supporters, they downplay it and say "nobody cares about that stuff". Because *they* don't care about it. They're failing to realize how out of step they are with 90% of Americans. And they're refusing to accept that the GOP's anti-Sanders ads would be substantive and persuasive.
NYTimes | The Case for Elizabeth Warren
It just makes me mad because she‚Äôs so obviously the best candidate who has identified the key issues with American capitalism and democracy with laser clarity but people are going after her for the pettiest reasons
Though I am not a total news junkie, I do actually know who Michelle Goldberg is, and I'm pleased she wrote this; now, if the rest of the media could maybe, oh, I don't know... stop putting all things Warren on mute?
California voter here, split between Warren, Bernie, and Biden. I'm actually leaning towards voting for Warren. She is at 15.4% on the RCP California tracker. I feel like she could come out of a contested convention as the unity candidate.
Now they want endorse just her. Wish they would have done that to start
I posted it in r/news it got buried. I'm beginning to think there's a media blackout or something.
One of my frequent frustrations with politicians is that they never seem to be saying anything. There are no definitive statements, no clear answers, just vague buzzwords and cheap shots at each other. What I love about Elizabeth is she actually has plans, she says things with substance, she's very clear about what she thinks and where she stands on the issues. She's an excellent communicator, which I attribute to her experience as an educator. In all my voting years, I have NEVER been excited about a candidate. I'm excited about Elizabeth Warren.
Ugh paywall
They really screwed up (NYTimes) by endorsing her and Amy. When you do that, you continue to muddle the waters.

Exactly!
This was a great article and the main point being CFPB/anti corruption, something i wish she would push more. Of all candidates including Trump she is the only one who has a true grip on capitalism and democracy.   One of the most compelling things i've heard her say was about putting money into science to develop green tech and build it here. Yeah i'd agree that tapping into what will be the biggest global industry the world has ever seen might be a good idea.
[removed]
She is so authentic and incredibly capable. I saw her speak. She‚Äôs a dynamo.
New York Times helped Trump.  What gives?
For all that Bernie is painted as anti-establishment, Warren has some real enemies doing everything in their power to kill her campaign right now  Pete‚Äôs SuperPAC just dropped $1 million worth of ads in SC. He‚Äôs polling at 6% there, viability is impossible. That SuperPAC is funded by a bunch of Wall Street executives. The only reason they‚Äôd be doing that is to try and overtake Liz who is at 8% to damage her some more.  These people are all feckless idiots.
I‚Äôm with you 100%. Some people have rejected her for the most bizarre and ridiculous reasons. Most American just aren‚Äôt thinking sensibly about this.
Agreed. I hate to sound elitist, but there's a reason Warren has some of the highest educated demographics... I thought she'd be more relatable to the average Democratic voter, but I guess not. I think she comes off as condescending to some, is what I gather.
It‚Äôs buttery mails all over again. We/Americans just can‚Äôt see the substance of people in our elections.
They can't win on facts, they can't win on policy.   So don't let your opponent speak without being harassed and don't ever talk about the issues, unless you steal them wholesale and tell your supporters you made it first.
> who has identified the key issues with American capitalism and democracy with laser clarity  *and* she offers credible solutions!   really, this is not to be underestimated. imv, a few people figured out the problems with the system. but they don't/can't put plans forward of how to fix those. contrast warren: great analyses and well-thought through solutions.
I think the biggest difference is how they need voters. People have been disempowered and are looking for ways to contribute and get power again.  Warren is a technocrat. She's got the policy down forwards and backwards, she just needs you to get her into office and she'll set things right. She's going to fix the federal system all the way in DC. States are not a big part of the plan, aside from being affected by federal policy.  Sanders is a populist. He's got good policy and needs you to get him into office, but that is only part of his message. He wants you to get in the ground game to change local politics too, because you can only change so much in DC.  Sanders' message resonates more strongly because people see a place for themselves in the power structure aside from the election. And visualizing that place empowers them.   I think that's what's missing from Warren's messaging. She's got a plan for everything but that also means a strong federal system where individuals don't see a place for their own localized change.
I think she definitely can. With how widespread her support is as a second choice amongst other candidates (and even pulling people in from the Republican side, as well) ‚Äî there‚Äôs a strong case for her becoming the unity candidate in a contested convention. And one I think a lot of people would be pretty happy with, if it came down to that.   She‚Äôs said it before; it‚Äôs not about they win, she loses or she wins, they lose ‚Äî it‚Äôs about coming together to rebuild a movement and party that supports and acknowledges everyone and their ideas and opinions on how to improve it going forward.  I hope she gets your vote!! üíö
[deleted]
It looks like they have one of these for every candidate. This is pretty good, but the VOX video that was also just posted is a much more inspiring take on why she‚Äôs the best.
>I'm beginning to think there's a media blackout or something.  Seriously? From the /r/news sidebar:  >Your post will be removed if it:  >* is an opinion/analysis or advocacy piece. * primarily concerns politics.

SHE‚ÄôS the freak who will show up with 17 idiotic plans every day and keep everyone up until it gets done.‚Äù Vicious reactionary that she is, Coulter cut to the heart of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs promise.  >Warren has an almost supernatural ability to identify problems before anyone else, and to work relentlessly to solve them. Of all the Democratic candidates, she would make the most effective president. (Full disclosure: My husband, a graphic designer and creative director, works as a consultant for her.)  >In 2007, Warren, then a Harvard law professor, wrote an article in the journal Democracy calling for the creation of what she called a Financial Product Safety Commission. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúBut it is possible to finance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.‚Äù This was before a cascade of mortgage failures set off the financial crisis, which she foresaw.  >Warren realized that complexity was being weaponized against consumers, pointing out that a typical credit card contract had grown from one page in the 1980s to more than 30 pages two decades later. Ordinary people didn‚Äôt have the bandwidth to understand the terms they were agreeing to, allowing lenders to fleece them.  >Four years later her brainchild, now called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was a reality. It‚Äôs no small thing for someone who had little direct government experience to single-handedly spearhead the creation of a new agency. The CFPB has since provided $12.4 billion in relief to 31 million consumers.  >I was one of them. As I‚Äôve written before, I turned to the CFPB after discovering that my bank had enrolled me, without my knowledge, in a dubious program that purported to protect users‚Äô credit. The bank had been fined $700 million in connection with it, but that didn‚Äôt get me my money back. So I went to the CFPB website, where I filled out a simple form. A few weeks later, my bank notified me that I was being refunded more than $11,000.  >That experience is part of why my husband signed up to consult with Warren. (To design her logo, he went to the Statue of Liberty to find the precise color of green.)  >What amazed me about the CFPB was its seamlessness. As Will Wilkinson has written, Warren‚Äôs agenda, with its blizzard of plans and calls for ‚Äúbig structural change,‚Äù has been painted as ‚Äúcontentiously ideological and bureaucratically suffocating.‚Äù This perception is upside down. Warren‚Äôs genius is using the regulatory process to make it simple for ordinary people to stand up to financial behemoths. She knows how excessive bureaucracy can be a tool of domination, and how to defend people from it.  >Even if a Democrat wins the presidency in November, Democrats won‚Äôt be able to pass significant legislation unless they both take the Senate and eliminate the filibuster. That will make Warren‚Äôs mastery of the levers of executive power particularly important. As a senator, she was known for zeroing in on seemingly obscure appointments, understanding how, say, having the wrong person as an under secretary for domestic finance could translate into real-world suffering. She has plans to use executive action to address problems like student loan debt and prescription drug prices.  >Warren also has the most inspirational personal story of any of the contenders. The daughter of a maintenance man, she dropped out of college to get married, then returned to school to become a special ed teacher. When she lost her job after getting pregnant, she went to law school and soared to the top of her field. Many candidates would present such an extraordinary rise as evidence of unique personal grit, but Warren sees it as a parable about how good government policy can enable social mobility.  >Unlike Bernie Sanders, she doesn‚Äôt carry the electoral albatross of socialism; she wants to purify capitalism of stifling corruption so it works as it should. Not for nothing is her dog, Bailey, named after the virtuous small-town banker played by Jimmy Stewart in ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Wonderful Life.‚Äù  >Under Trump, American government has become a squalid orgy of self-dealing. There is not a person on earth better suited to clean it up than Warren. If this were a Jimmy Stewart movie, she‚Äôd come from behind to win the nomination. Right now that possibility looks remote, but as long as she‚Äôs still in the race and most of America hasn‚Äôt voted, it‚Äôs not too late for the nightmare of the Trump era to give way to a Hollywood ending.

They are doing it for all of the candidates.  Wouldn't be surprised if they did one for Trump, too.
Because they know in 40 years Sanders has done very little. But LIz did and does. She‚Äôs the one who went after the banks. It‚Äôs disgusting how Sanders has gained from Liz‚Äôs resume. Apparently all it takes is to yell and finger wag.
>Most American just aren‚Äôt thinking sensibly about this.  That becomes painfully obvious when so many people's second choice candidate seems to be the one that's most different from their first choice.
My support is for both Sanders and Warren, and I have seen the most insane, inane reasons why one is loved and the other hated.  Often contradictory.
It's amazing because if you set aside the policy stuff ‚Äì¬†she and Sanders obviously have different approaches but both check a lot of boxes for the base of supporters between them ‚Äì Warren is obviously so much warmer, funnier, and more charming it's just hard to understand how she isn't relatable.  I've met both of them and Bernie (don't get me wrong, I support him 100%!) is gruff, seems annoyed, and does not want to meet or spend time with people. On the other hand, Warren is personable, wants to hear peoples' stories, and takes time to get to know people. It's like *that's* the important part to her. I've met her a few times over the years and she may recognize my face but she wouldn't know my name or anything like that. But I was at an event where I was helping take pictures on a rope line for her and at the end when everyone else got their picture, she looked at me and said "What about you?" and I was like, "Oh, don't worry, I've gotten plenty of pictures with you! I know you're busy and have to go to your next event..." And she was like, "Nonsense! This is the good part," and encouraged me to come in for a pic. It was only a moment but she could have just as easily been like "Okay!" and moved on, but that warmth was natural for her and instinctive.
Genuine question: How much do you think being a woman has to do with it? I can't help but feel if a male spoke the same way he would be seen as well-spoken with a great plan for our country. Whereas, with a woman it is just labelled as condescending, without hearing the actual merit behind what she is saying.
I've also been thinking this, but was also afraid of sounding snobby. I think Warren may appeal more to college educated people because she's pragmatic and knows how politics works. She knows having policies that are too rigid and drastic usually gets nothing done. She knows how to appeal to both people's emotions and reason. Her slogan is "big, *structural* change" for a reason. I guess the average American isn't that far seeing and wants things to either go back to normal or change everything completely. The problem is that Trump is a symptom, and historically, revolutions usually fail miserably or succeed at a high price. I hope that didn't sound elitist, just wanted to add on.
> I think she comes off as condescending to some, is what I gather.  I think the public has been *told* that she's "elitist" and "condescending" by both Republicans and a certain someone's campaign followers, and I think the public--not ever having listened to *her*--just bought it.  I refuse to accept that anyone who has actually listened to her speak, or hold people accountable in congress, thinks she's any of those things.   Jon Stewart said as much in that first interview she did about the financial crisis--she made it plain, she made it clear what the problem was, and she made it feel *manageable*. Anyone who actually listens to her would feel the same sort of comfort in feeling like here's a leader who knows wtf is going on and how to fix it.  I think her PR team needs to put out moments of her talking and get that message across.
She's intelligent, well spoken, but worst of all, a woman.   Sadly these are all negatives to much of the American electorate...
My dad, who is a loyal Democrat and comes from a family of Democrats, told me after the Nevada debate that he thought she was ‚Äúshrill,‚Äù and I cringed when I read it.   He‚Äôs a college-educated Midwestern Democrat. He‚Äôs older so has some blind spots, but he‚Äôs a good man and supports a huge portion of her platform. She somehow rubs him the wrong way, and it‚Äôs no doubt in part because of the way his generation was raised to view women. (That said, his top candidate from the start was Harris, and he likes Klobuchar now, so he‚Äôs definitely not opposed to women generally, just something about her.)  That‚Äôs a challenge Warren sadly faces. Factors that shouldn‚Äôt matter often do.
[removed]
Probably condescending, plus she's a woman.  I don't want to make it all about gender, but all those questions about her "electability" last fall were dog whistles, my friends.
I don't think most people have ever heard hear speak in more than 5 second sound bites. I think that's the disconnect - making snap judgement about the "lecturing elite woman" without ever hearing what she's saying.
I think she is relatable!  I think that the problem with her campaign is the same thing that Bernie had an opportunity to learn against Hillary Clinton.  He needed a groundswell in the beginning to foment the momentum forward early in the primary.  All due respect to Liz, but she and her campaign are behind Bernie on that count.  He has been running for President since 2015 and she has only started.  I wouldn't discount anything about her or how she has run her campaign or devised her policy plans or otherwise except failing to make the same early strategy change that Bernie has already made.
The political media has a lot to answer for
Two problems i see:   1. They need to cull the debate stage again to get serious. Bloomberg is disqualified because hes too late to the game, you can't step in at the 9th debate, its disrespectful of the process. Anyone under 2% should be cut instantly. That alone would have brought the debate down to a manageable number months earlier.   2. These aren't debates. Nobody has time to make an argument or counterargument. These have been Game Shows. Contestants blurt out answers. Moderators think they are funny or that their opinions matter: they are Hosts not Moderators.   Go watch something like Intelligence Squared on YouTube. That's how a debate should be run. Pick a topic like Medicare. Sit Bernie and Liz on a team. Sit the Moderates on another team. Have a third team if someone can articulate a good third position. Moderators only job is to explain the topic and structure the allotted time.
buttery mails?
> I think that's what's missing from Warren's messaging  I actually don't like the idea of my President leading a push on state-by-state reform.  The reforms that'll stick need to happen at the federal level.  If the vote's clean and the federal government mandates quality of life, the states can do what they want in their highly-regulated role.  I think the party (moving back to the left where it belongs) should be the ones rocking the states.
Warren has a huge grassroots coalition with offices in every state and territory, and is much better than Sanders at recognizing that midterms and local elections are going to matter a ton for actually getting policy implemented.
I tire of seeing Sanders supporters parking in our sub like they own it.
Only one constituency stays home or submits protest votes if their candidate is not the nominee  and it‚Äôs not nonwhite Americans.
Happy cake day!
Firefox containers work pretty well for this, too. Lately I've been using the [Auto Reader Mode](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-reader-view/) extension in Firefox to bypass paywalls. It switches to reader mode before the paywall gets a chance to load.
I literally cited sources on YouTube with clips of Warren speaking. And others are using youtube to make Bernie look bad but those must count right?
Being a man helps.
But they share one important quality--the almighty penis.
to me that doesn't mean they're not thinking sensibly, just means they're probably not paying attention
Which is cracks me up in a dark depressing way.
Well, people vote for all sorts of different reasons.   Not all voters vote based on policy (I do personally).
It doesn't help that *some* in the Sanders base have an odd cult-like persona about him. I've seen it with some people I know, and it doesn't seem to matter who you are talking about. Warren is the most comparable to Sanders, but they will attack anyone who isn't Bernie.
Agreed 100%. I saw someone on r/politics say she had "low emotional intelligence", and I was like -- are we talking about the same Elizabeth Warren?!
she's the best in *every* way, it's really amazing.
Saying this as a male, women are put into a lose-lose situation where if they come off as too feminine and polite, they're weak and emotional... If they come off as stern and masculine, they're gross and emotional‚Äîjust in a different way. Warren has balanced the two as best as one can possibly do so, all the while simply being herself... Yet that just isn't enough for some people.   I mean, look at Amy Klobuchar's grating arrogance. I can see that. I just don't see that with Warren, though.  But I seriously wonder if some of the electorate is confusing the two on stage.
I have two cats and work at a nonprofit. Biden seems like he would listen to me talk about them and my job, Sanders would blow me off because he doesn‚Äôt care, and Warren would actually remember their names and what I did. It should just be based on vibe but Warren always seems like she would be interested in me personally, not just as a voter or someone from the 99%.
> it's just hard to understand how she isn't relatable.  No penis. And unfortunately, for a lot of Americans that's a required feature for the presidency.
In the same way that "shrill" or "angry" can be coded words that hide the sexism behind the description of a woman (and **have** been used, directly against Warren and Hillary in the past), I want to point out that Jewish people are often labelled with terms as "neurotic" "cold" "humorless" and "impersonal" (to list four I've directly seen).
If Elizabeth Warren had a Y chromosome she'd be up by 20 points.
I keep hearing this about Pete - he "sounds presidential"  Couldn't be he sounds male, white, and educated.....
Oh for sure.  She's hamstrung by the idea that women who speak in a bold and forceful manner are perceived as [shrill and hysterical](https://qz.com/1496726/2018-is-the-year-women-tried-to-reclaim-anger-but-failed/), but the same lines spoken by a man are interpreted as "inspirational" and "passionate".  The righteous anger of [this slighted white man](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brett-kavanaughs-righteous-anger-1538519713) is a good use case.  And here's the key: Progressives are *angry* at the state of the country and the government, and rightfully so.  So we're seeking out a conduit for that anger and frustration; someone who can give it voice.  But since women aren't publicly "allowed" to be angry in the same way as men, it leaves her at a disadvantage, despite her history of service and organizational acumen.  I still support her 100% and I feel it's important to call that out.  One of the things I find is that conservatives often have little problem with being called sexist or whatever, but, if you dare even hint that a progressive's actions may be influenced by unconscious bias, they take it very harshly since we partially build our identities around our Certified WokeScore^¬Æ.
If she was a man, then she'd be THE MAN.
It's sad we have to preface an educated, intelligent discussion with "elitism" so as not to offend people who have fragile egos / insecurity issues...  I think her message is close, but still not quite as resonant as I was hoping; I admittedly think Sanders is a bit better in messaging, but as others pointed out, he's gone through this game once already. For example, her slogan as you mentioned may be better "fix the system!" or something. People hear "the system is broken" on the daily, and so this helps appeal to that. "Big, structural change" is just a bit more verbose to appeal to the average jane or joe.   Personally, I think she needed to find a way to stand out from Sanders better than huddling close to Medicare For All and using the 2 cents tax thing which I just don't think resonates that well. In my view, she should've come out swinging that Campaign Finance / Election Reform is the root of every issue. Tie back every problem back to this, and go a step above everyone else in calling for publicly-funded elections and revoking FPTP. Use ads to educate people on what this means and why it's the source of every other single issue in Washington. Saying, "corruption in Washington" as she often does is nice, but it's a bit too vague.    I say this in past tense because it's going to be hard to change course on the eve of Super Tuesday no less. Hopefully she can pull through.
It's really just an emotions appeal contest. The past several candidates who won were all "change" candidates, for better or for worse: Obama, Trump, maybe Bernie. I don't think it's an american thing, but a human thing - people quickly become dissatisfied with what's happening around them and think that change *isn't happening fast enough* and go with a different/more extreme candidate the next time around.
My thoughts are that propaganda and its mechanisms aren't very well understood, probably by anyone but a few academicians, and intelligent people who have lived under authoritarian regimes who were able to recognize and analyze it.  I think that one of propaganda's first precepts is that for the majority of people, the first thing they heard sticks the longest. So if anyone even hears the words "Elizabeth Warren" and "elitist" or "condescending" or "know-it-all", that's the emotional impression that gets formed. And we know from the Trump era that emotions often override logical and rational thinking.
Amy Klobuchar is shrill... But how can that POSSIBLY describe Warren? I'd be tempted to ask if he's confusing the two...
This is an accusation often lobbed at Warren and I don‚Äôt think it tells the full story   She has favorability numbers with Latinx and black voters that are very comparable with Sanders and she‚Äôs a first time candidate. They‚Äôre just not breaking her way when it‚Äòs time to vote and I think the fact Bernie has had a 4 year head start in outreach would explain a lot of that.  If you look at the Nevada results, people will say she only got 9% of the total black vote. But if you break down the demographics of her own vote share, that number is a much higher proportion (the Latinx number was terrible though)   Bernie‚Äôs basically consolidated most of the cross demo support that was also considering her. I think if he weren‚Äôt in the race- and she‚Äôs also competing against a popular former VP- it would be a different story. She won‚Äôt win unless she can dislodge some of that support, but unlike Pete and Amy, it‚Äôs not because of a lack of trying.
Mike Brzezinski said some of the most misogynist stuff I have ever heard lately, due to how well Elizabeth has done in the most recent debates.  The one that really upset me was questioning whether Bloomberg really said "kill it" when we have a male third party witness who says he remembers it was that bad.  This is a woman who was all about "I believe the women" when it was cool two years ago.  They played a montage a few episodes ago on Morning Joe about how well they've treated Warren, and at least half of the clips they were belittling her success while she was ahead.  I really think I just need to quit watching MSNBC.  They are no better than CNN at this point.  Worse, in some ways.
> Go watch something like Intelligence Squared on YouTube. That's how a debate should be run. Pick a topic like Medicare. Sit Bernie and Liz on a team. Sit the Moderates on another team.

Agreed, these debates are a joke. They don't want to actually get the candidates's positions out to the public, they want to sell ads and grab headline sound-clips that can drive views/clicks.  And please, get rid of audiences at debates. Why are we cheering and booing like it's a WWE match? It's stupid.
"but her emails!"
I don't like it either. I like uniformity of laws and don't like patchwork. But it is something that the general population believes, that their corner is unique and needs special treatment. I work in real estate and everyone thinks that they need a special traffic study on the number of parking spaces a new building has despite many already existing in the same city, county, and state establishing similar trends.  That carries over to enacting laws. People want to feel like they have a personalized stake. We're a federal system, and I think that's why - just the perception of difference is enough to create state level differences.  Heck, we don't even need to enact different policies state by state. Just enact the same one in each state. Win small victories that establish a foundation of support for national victories. The GOP has been trying and succeeding with that agenda with ALEC. Let's beat them at their own game while we work on the national level.  My ultimate point though, is that people want to make this stuff happen. If it's limited to the federal level, we don't get as much engagement as we do with also local and state firing.
Ok, but then why aren't we seeing the same level of support for her? I think the media does spoil for a fight, and gives unfair equality to both well designed plans and ones missing substance. Sexism is also at play. But that's not the whole of it.  Is she not emphasizing winning local level campaigns enough? Because I don't think that message is breaking through if she is.
I support Warren, am voting for her, have phonebanked for her, and am going to the Super Tuesday group watch party. My family uses the budget plan she developed with her daughter. Her plans are awesome and I'm 100% on board.  I supported Sanders in 2016 because Warren wasn't running. I supported Clinton in the general.  This was just something I feel is a different type of messaging between the campaigns. I don't think it is a bad thing to raise observations.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs today? It was showing up yesterday evening too. Weird.   Thanks!
You seem to be more interested in telling people why they shouldn't vote for Warren rather than why they should vote for Bernie. Genuine question: Is that a good approach in your mind? Do you believe that is the most effective way to persuade voters? Through anger instead of inspiration?
no - Klobuchar voters overwhelming select Warren as second choice.
[deleted]
Yeah, you are totally right about the cult of personality behind Bernie.    When Warren announced her campaign, almost everyone I knew who was die hard all in for Bernie was excited about it. Then as soon as Bernie announced his campaign....they waited until she made one misstep and then just took that as their carte blanche to start shouting from everywhere how much they freaking hated her.    It's so crazy...because she's BEEN known as someone who has used her few terms in the senate to get a bunch of shit done and it felt like, before 2016, way more people knew about her than Bernie....because she had been so damn outspoken about how effed up banks were. But she didn't just talk, she worked to pass legislation.    I don't understand wtf happened.
I've encountered a few of them in the wild, myself.  It's definitely weird, and not something I share with them.  Sanders and Warren are both decent politicians and - as far as I'm able to determine without getting to know them for a decade - decent human beings.  Either one would make an excellent president.
Definitely seen this! Then I've seen where people publicly hate on these people with the intent to humiliate and make it even worse. The whole dynamic is then us vs. them for both sides which puts off people from even debating the topic.
Here is the answer to your question, hands down: The reason people support Sanders specifically, versus any other candidate with the same policies, is that they perceive Bernie to be "genuine". A candidate with identical policies isn't accepted as a substitute because they lack the literal decades worth of "receipts" from fighting for these very same policies and causes - even back when it was "political suicide" to do it. Whatever positives other candidates bring to the table, they have more confidence that Bernie will continue to fight for exactly the things he says he will. If that's the dimension you're using to evaluate candidates, it's very difficult for anyone else to win.  Frankly the "Liz can make it happen" angle is by far her strongest case (relative to Bernie), but it may be too little too late at this point. It really could have landed several months ago.  EDIT: Downvote or ignore facts if you want, but that's 100% the reason behind what you like to consider a cult of personality. Fail to understand the source of other candidates' appeal at your own peril.
She‚Äôs either shrill and angry or sounds like she‚Äôs about to cry or has ‚Äúlow emotional intelligence‚Äù. There‚Äôs no winning with these types
She really is.
>   >   > But I seriously wonder if some of the electorate is confusing the two on stage.   For sure. We need them to recognize this to make any real change happen, too.
Legitimate concern. But both times I've been at private events with him he's been unwilling to take time to talk to anyone, was very "head down moving on" mentality and it all came off as quite cold. I've seen him hug voters and clearly part of his charm is being the gruff grandpa so I know that exists in him somewhere just hasn't come out either time I've met him. ‚Äæ\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/‚Äæ
Agree 100%! Off topic but I believe Pete also would be higher if he wasn't gay. Sexism and homophobia are still rampant even more so than racism IMO.
I'm not sure how much that would change the dynamics of the race. Who would be less of a factor (where would the votes come from)?  That would clearly be the votes that Liz should be targeting, but I can't tell from which voters she would get them.
Pete is just a Bill Clinton impersonator without the sex appeal or charm. He sounds presidential because hes copying Bills mannerisms.
He sounds like he doesnt have anything to bring to the table.   His sales pitch in every debate is "please vote for me" with no reason behind it

Trump and many of his supporters are united because Trump is running the most blatant identity politics based on fear and self-righteousness. They rally around some of the majority identities, mainly being white and being Christian, and vilify other disadvantaged identities such as being Muslim, being Mexican, being black, being women, etc. This brand of identity politics is epitomized by this quote: ["He‚Äôs not hurting the people he needs to be"](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/8/18173678/trump-shutdown-voter-florida). Trump has been so blatant that he punishes states which voted against him and favors states which supported him - identity politics based on political identities.  Many people in the left want to help various groups. This is identity politics based on compassion. The only policies which are not criticized as identity politics are those which benefit everyone (UBI) or which benefit white and other middle classes (Medicare for All, Broadband for All etc).  For policies which benefit other identities (e.g. immigrants, people of color, women, LGBT, disabilities), some people in left and right criticize that they are divisive or pandering. They claim that any extra help to these other identities is unfair or punishment to others or "promoting equal outcomes vs. equal opportunities".  Some people argued that the criticism against identity politics are the same the criticism against any liberal policies. For example, people also said that canceling student loans is unfair or punishment to others. They are not the same. The fundamental attack from the left against "identity politics" is that  there is no systematic discrimination against various groups of people.  They are all economic inequality. The emotion behind is  prejudice/disbelief/dismissive. The fundamental attack against cancelling student loan is that people who suffer are irresponsible or not smart  comparing to people who don't qualify. The emotion behind is  self-righteousness.  To provide an analogy.  * "identity politics": When a person has pain and go to a doctor, the doctor says your pain is all in your head. * "student  loan": When a person has pain and go to a doctor, the doctor says I  managed to deal with this pain without any medication, you should be  able to do it as well.  To sum up, people in the left should not let others frame the politics of helping diverse groups of people as negative. If it means not using the term "identity politics", don't use it. Helping diverse groups of people is great and is key to beat Trump. If we don't, we are  essentially disarming ourselves. We will fall into  the trap of Trump.  When Trump goes after Mexicans, we need to fight for  Mexicans. When  Trump goes after women, we need to fight for women.  When Trump goes  after Muslim, we need to fight for Muslim. Otherwise,  one day no one  will fight for us, let alone about M4A or Broadband for  All.  [Identity politics isn‚Äôt hurting liberalism. It‚Äôs saving it.](https://www.vox.com/2020/2/20/20954059/liberalism-identity-politics-defense)
Reminder: Elizabeth Warren was the FIRST candidate to support impeachment on 04/19/19
That's nothing.  Warren advocated for a Financial Product Safety Commission over a year before the financial collapse in 2008.   She is among only three people who can claim to have seen the 2008 collapse coming that I have found any evidence for.  While I'm on the fence until a clear front-runner emerges, this single fact alone has me leaning towards Warren.
From her Twitter feed  >The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.   >   >Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: ‚ÄúCongress has authority to prohibit a President‚Äôs corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.‚Äù The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment.   >   >To ignore a President‚Äôs repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways.   >   >The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.  &#x200B;  Thank you Senator. It seems courage to do one's duty is at an all time low. Thank you for never backing down from a hard fight and putting duty first.
Yet another reason Warren is the anti-corruption candidate!
I've thought about this several times today. And reminded my mother.
This is what true leadership looks like! üôå #Warren2020
I'm glad Congress is _finally_ starting to do something. Now, only if they would use their Contempt of Congress powers when a witness refuses to answer questions. Have Capitol Police arrest them!
Right on Warren
[removed]
Well technically it was Steyer but
FWIW, all is the candidates supported impeachment way too late.
Bold stand /s
Born on same day year as Merrill Streep...
And yet why is she unable to see that capitalism itself is the problem?  The whole system comes crashing down every ten years. If capitalism were your roommate, you would have moved out a long time ago.
But in this case Warren was wrong. It was too soon. Pelosi is doing everything right.
I'm as much for the downfall of capitalism as the next comrade, but it will happen in increments and Warren is a giant step in the right direction.
Can you explain why Pelosi is doing everything right? I'm not seeing people making the argument.
Pelosi pretty much only impeached because she had to after tons of pressure. If Trump didn't essentially admit to treason on live TV we probably wouldn't be impeaching.  Not sure why people think she's playing 5-d chess.
The President personally committed a crime with his attempts to tie appropriated Ukraine aid to some sort of probe into Hunter Biden. The fact that the Biden probe would benefit him is just adding to the crime. Congressional appropriations are not subject to presidential whims.
The Mueller report was a dud.  All the Republicans were hoping we'd try to impeach, because it would backfire.  Obstructing an investigation is a valid charge, but to most people it feels like circular logic.    Pelosi has been running the politics like she should.  Warren called for impeachment earlier‚Äîbecause she knew it wasn't going to happen.
Pelosi has been reaping record-breaking political donations while the country was suffering at Trump's hands. She was blocking impeachment for personal power.   Warren's greatest strength is aligning with party leadership when they're right, and defying party leadership when their heads are up their own asses.
There already enough to impeach. Obstruction of justice, campaign finance violations, emolument clause, and so on.
Or because the Mueller report described impeachable behavior
New poll finds Elizabeth Warren in a statistical tie with Biden for first place nationally with Biden at 21 percent and Warren at 20 percent
If she wins Iowa I think she‚Äôs gonna walk away with this thing.
And only up from here! Looking bad for the establishment since the establishment candidate is already losing momentum.
Biden provides 0% inspiration, but I'll vote for him if I have to.  Warren, on the other hand, seems willing to shoot for the moon.  She will inspire folks to get involved... and THAT is the only way we're gonna get our stuff together after trump leaves office.
I love Warren and all, but the overall point of this article is not that her and Joe are in a statistical tie, it's that polls are so extremely volatile right now that effectively none of them can be trusted. One poll might have Warren and Biden nearly tied (YouGov), but another have Warren & Biden at 10% and 31% respectively (The Hill), a massive 21% divide. Additionally, YouGov has consistently been the only pollster to have Biden in the low twenties, and their polls are following the same group of people from poll to poll, meaning they may not be statistically applicable to the larger electorate. Overall, in the kind of political climate we have right now, where the stakes are so high that democrats are terrified of nominating the wrong candidate, there is a level of randomness that renders polling in this stage largely unreliable.
Although it's onoy one poll, Change Research has got her as #1 in Iowa! I'm hoping for the best!
Warren is the one
She's got this!
‚ÄúStatistical tie‚Äù is a meaningless phrase. Despite Warren being within the margin of error, that doesn‚Äôt mean her numbers in this poll are statistically indistinguishable from Biden‚Äôs - she‚Äôs definitely still behind, especially when you compare this poll to others. Still it‚Äôs great that she has upward momentum, but let‚Äôs try to avoid setting unrealistic expectations.
As a Georgian who can‚Äôt stand the cheating shitstain sitting in my Governor‚Äôs office, nothing would make me happier than voting for a Warren/Abrams ticket next year.
Well that's weird. Maybe the voters actually *don't* want more middle of the road bullshit. Maybe the voters are just being *told* that's what they want.
I think she would crush trump.
The term ‚Äúa statistical tie‚Äù is pointless and misleading. Being within the margin of error tells you more about the sample size than the closeness of the race. Margins of error are a confidence interval on a normal curve - look into statistics curves for some more info.
Yang will soon overtake all 3.  The day will soon come.  We as Americans will get our Freedom Dividend and we'll work in an economy measured by new metrics to incentivize Human-Centered Capitalism. We will have Medicare for all and an enviromentally friendly, modern infrastructure. The trickle up economy is upon us.  [Yang 2020](https://www.yang2020.com/)
Are there still superdelegates? They can override the popular will.
"President Warren" has a beautiful ring to it.
Winning Iowa and Nevada, as well as outperforming expectations in South Carolina, would set her up nicely to weather whatever Super Tuesday brings. Success in New Hampshire is more expected and as such won‚Äôt turn heads or write headlines.
going to donate now!
Simpsons already predicted it.
I feel pretty confident about Iowa. Since Warren has so many concrete policies, it‚Äôs going to be really easy for Warren supporters in Iowa to advocate for her positions, and people are a lot more enthusiastic about supporting her than the people that support Biden
If she wins Iowa Biden's campaign implodes.
She has the right attitude to win Iowa for sure.
I really like her but I disagree. The race will be in her favor, but far from over. Most black voters in the south gravitate to Biden (mostly bc they dont really know the candidates and associate him with Obama).    She‚Äôs going to have to make a meaningful impression in the southern states, or else we‚Äôll see a similar outcome to 2016 where Bernie was close and won some of the northern states and didn‚Äôt really compete well in the south.   It might lead up to a really close convention if she wins Iowa, but we‚Äôll really know that she has it in the bag if she does well in the south.
I would be more excited to walk into a voting booth than I was in 2008. And I thought I‚Äôd never be that happy to vote for someone again in my lifetime
Except they aren‚Äôt that volatile. Biden has consistently been above the rest since before he announced his campaign, with Sanders then Warren trailing behind. This is the first time I‚Äôve seen Warren move past Sanders which is a big deal.
That just mean the margin of error is bigger. Still good to track her weighted average over time and support her and it‚Äôs OK to be excited, just be realistic when the nomination comes around and continue supporting the not republican candidate
You have to compare the previous polls from the same pollster. For example The Economist poll has Elizabeth Warren behind Biden by 3 points. Previously she was behind Biden by 7.
Warren/O'Rourke is my dream ticket. Talk about fire and fury...
YouGov is also an online poll and doesn't use cellular phones. I'd wait for one of the A+ rated polls that have her above the margin of error. https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/  Regardless, this poll is good news and we're going to have to work harder to get her the nomination.
There are, but they can‚Äôt vote on the first convention ballot.
No pretty sure the DNC gave them the boot
Very strong.
Yeah, but that would be the first two and 3/4.
I think much like Obama with SC, her winning Iowa will probe she‚Äôs electable (killing that silly narrative). Black people know who she‚Äôs is at this point (Black women especially). Speaking anecdotally, my family and friends (Who are all Black) are very much paying attention and Warren is peaking a lot of their interest because she‚Äôs talking about issues that have been long ignored (including by Bernie).
Think about it like this:   As a white woman, while I am desperate to beat Trump, but, as a whole, my life and liberty has not changed much under his administration. I want him out of office because of all the reasons we all do, but I recognize that I‚Äôm not affected by his presidency the way a PoC is.  So I think, when we see a lot of black people support Biden, it‚Äôs just because there‚Äôs a narrative that he can beat Trump the most easily.
If you find aggregate polling data with a margin of error around 20% valuable, I'm afraid you're missing the larger point. But I agree that it's okay to be excited.
Oh my God, yes!
Completely agree. I love O'Rourke, but he doesn't yet have the expirience to be a president in my opinion, but he'd be an amazing VP and you know he could wipe the floor with Pence.
O‚ÄôRourke isn‚Äôt my top choice for Veep but if he could bring home Texas the GOP is fucked. Also, they immediately switch angles on getting rid of the EC, and that‚Äôs what I want.
There are still superdelegates, just less than 2016. That said I‚Äôm not worried about them overriding the will of the people. They haven‚Äôt before.
Very persistent.
I‚Äôm not saying NH doesn‚Äôt matter. It absolutely does. Ideally she would win all three. That being said, NH sends less of a message. Let‚Äôs observe three possible scenarios in which she takes 1st in two states and 2nd in one:  A: 2nd place IA, 1st place NH, 1st place NV  B: 1st place IA, 2nd place NH, 1st place NV  C: 1st place IA, 1st place NH, 2nd place NV  If you have to pick one of the above three, scenario B is probably the best for her momentum going forward.
https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1162426361740431360?s=21  Polls suggest that she‚Äôs not very well known among blacks. Nearly 50% of blacks don‚Äôt really keep up w the election rn, and most who are aware like Biden. This is might be because they haven‚Äôt spent a lot of time weighing their options and already know Biden.    Obama was a different case. His issue was the opposite - he‚Äôs black, so he‚Äôll pretty easily get the black vote,  but are whites that Iowa represents receptive to him? That‚Äôs why Iowa was a good indicator for him. EW is the exact opposite.   Also, Obama was consistently polling in the mid-20s at this stage in the election in 2007. The only candidate to do that is Biden.    Anecdotal evidence is nice, but polls speak louder. EW needs to be consistently hitting mid20s ASAP. I think a lot of it is that most ppl aren‚Äôt keeping up with the election (we‚Äôre *six months* away from Iowa!). But once things get moving, she needs to make sure that she‚Äôs in position.    2020 is not over until it‚Äôs over. The Dems have no room to relax until Trump is beaten.
That‚Äôs literally it. If he loses to another Dem early people will see he is weaker than they thought.
Also the vast majority of voters just aren‚Äôt as obsessed with politics as those of us who are subscribed to an Elizabeth Warren subreddit. They‚Äôre just living their lives, maybe reading the headlines and watching the evening news. They know Joe Biden, think he‚Äôs a nice guy who would be a lot more stable than Trump, and that‚Äôs the extent of it.
Even with a larger margin of error you can aggregate several polls to narrow it down. It‚Äôs not statistically useless. It‚Äôs not a recording of a dice roll. It‚Äôs actual polling data. It‚Äôs not valuable in the sense where you should place bets off of it. But it‚Äôs valuable when combined with all the other data and put into context and tracked. And I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with getting supporters excited, so long as we remember to be realistic come nomination.      Also, the margin of error is definitely not 20% lol. Margin of error is not a guess. It‚Äôs a margin calculated from expected distribution and sample size.
The only way superdelogates are doing to make a difference in this election is if 2 candidates pretty much tie. Which is unfortunate given the article this thread is about.
Very Wow.
I concur.
Just a side note, stop calling Black people ‚ÄúBlacks.‚Äù It comes off condescending in tone (not saying you are trying to be. ‚ÄúBlack people‚Äù is a far better turn of phrase and doesn‚Äôt sound like the group has no humanity. Kind of like referring to women as ‚Äúfemales‚Äù in conversation.
I don‚Äôt think anyone is relaxing btw, no time to do so no matter who the candidate is. Warren is polling solidly in 2nd place in many races. I think it‚Äôs far from over but winning Iowa doesn‚Äôt seem at all crazy. Also, Black women (very much the core of the party) at this point are shifting to Warren. Biden‚Äôs support from Black folks is mostly based (imo) on being Veep under Obama. As times goes on he continues slipping as everyone sees he‚Äôs a big of mess.
And that's fair. Even though I want Warren to be president, if Joe Biden got the nomination, I would donate to and support him, because he is way better than the alternative.
Very.
Very cool.
I can see EW really overtaking Biden once the race actually begins, bc he‚Äôll probably say some more stupid shit and Warren just has to keep being her. But I only see that as a likely possibility in the north. South is another story, if she‚Äôs flexible and her and her team can communicate well w these demos, she‚Äôll do great
Me every single night since I set up monthly donations
Apparently she leaves a voice mail telling you that you missed her call - which imo - is much worse!
I have a missed call from washington DC from a few weeks ago.   I think about this sometimes. I would post it to see if anyone knew but I don‚Äôt want to accidentally doxx anyone.
99% of the time it's just some scammer saying your social security number has been cancelled

Holy crap this is so me, lol. I get a LOT of calls from scammers. (sometimes 8+ calls a day) so I never answer unknown numbers and rely on them leaving me a message if it‚Äôs legitimate or important. I signed up for the Grab a Beer with Warren thing, and have been paranoid about missing the call. I‚Äôm hoping she leaves voicemails! She probably does. That doesn‚Äôt stop my paranoia, however.
A genuine reason to stay awake.
I'm not sure I'd get as much out of an unexpected conversation with her as I would get from a voicemail I can share with all my friends.
I have a voicemail from her because I screened a call like a dope, before I knew she was calling people. I thought it was a recording at first when I listened to it but it was actually her! I‚Äôll treasure the VM for life but I would have loved to have thanked her in person. Really cool that she does that.
I answered a DC number a few weeks ago but my phone glitched out.  Tried calling back and it didn't go through. Which is what scammers do but also what a presidential candidate would also do.
Does she not use a 617 number?
I saw a screenshot of someone‚Äôs voicemail from her. If it was her, the # would be blocked/unknown, and she would have left a voicemail. You can rest easy‚Äî you didn‚Äôt miss her
I once got one that said I was being sued by the Fire Department...
But what about my expiring car warranty?!?
New ones for me like to say there's fraudulent activity under my social and I'm going to have a "non-bailable arrest warrant" whatever the fuck that is
You should submit that as a post, we need more fun in this sub.
I'm not sure I would be coherent in my gushing about how much I love her and have supported her but I think she would get the picture.
Fair point.
I don't know how I feel about this. Great to have the VM but fuuuck!
Not sure. If you look up ‚ÄúElizabeth Warren phone number‚Äù it gives a number for her office but not a personal, but it indeed has that area code.
In the grim future of Fire Fighting For All Who Want It.
Yeah I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs not using her personal, but HQ is in Mass
Don't give them any ideas.   Buttigieg is trolling the forum as we speak.
Haha! Oh man.

"Freedom is about letting Americans choose what level of fire response is right for them and their family."
Jon Lovett from Pod Save America: "Warren's fourth-place finish is obviously disappointing because SHE SHOULD BE PRESIDENT."
This is about as close to an endorsement as you can get from people of Pod Save.
I knew Lovett was in for Warren. You could hear it in his voice the whole time. However I do understand why the PSA guys feel like they shouldn‚Äôt endorse a candidate and should give them all fair coverage.
He said very early on in the process that he would ‚Äúsleep like a baby‚Äù if Warren were president.  I have to agree with that sentiment.
I feel like I've head Lovett outright say Warren should be president (or that she is the most qualified) before.  Definitely an endorsement that should gain traction, isn't PSA *the* most listened political podcast in the US?
Was it there I heard that an explanation was that half of New Hampshire can access Boston radio (and they likely kill her on it)? Kinda helped me understand how she finished with less than 10%
This isn‚Äôt specific to these guys, but I‚Äôm starting to get very annoyed at all these influential people who know she should be president, know their endorsement would help her get there, and refuse to endorse her because...idk. Saving face if it doesn‚Äôt work? Hedging bets? This is a life and death election.
Warren has a pretty good path to the nomination:  She‚Äôs most peoples second choice candidate and pulls from both moderates and progressives. As more people drop out she will benefit the most.   With Bernie rising, moderate voters may decide to give a little ground and go for her but don‚Äôt want to go ‚Äúfull socialism‚Äù.   She‚Äôs said to have low minority support but she has a relatively high ‚Äúunknown‚Äù rating (17) with blacks compared to 3 or 4 for Biden and Sanders. So there‚Äôs room to grow as the campaign season goes on.   She also has low unfavorability ratings so it‚Äôs not like they dislike her.  She‚Äôs the second highest ‚Äúsecond choice‚Äù candidate after sanders. 20 to 24.   https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/washington-post-ipsos-poll-of-african-americans-jan-2-8-2020/a41b5691-e181-4cda-bb88-7b31935103d9/  Bernie‚Äôs health is still a factor and so is his low record of achievement, especially compared to Warren. This will get more scrutiny in the near future.  Now with AOC signaling that Bernie‚Äôs M4A plan could fail, Warren‚Äôs ‚Äúwaffling‚Äù (meaning she found a better path) will not look so bad.   She thrives in town halls and interviews where she has time to speak. With less people debating we may see her shine more.  She‚Äôs also a relentless fighter. I‚Äôm pretty confident we‚Äôre about to see some fire from her.
"this is a joke" Sure, Jon
Episode prior to this one, he said "If Warren were a man, she'd be up 40 fucking points."
I love Jon Lovett so much more, now!
Fantastic! I wish PSA would endorse Warren.
This is great, but I've been pretty annoyed with PSA lately. They have been stressing that a very small percentage of the electorate has voted so far and yet their messaging right now is that Bernie is going to be the nominee! I mean, I'm bias because I'm all in for EW but really. It's way too soon to say that! There are other candidates and it's just downright too early!
GAY NEWS!!!

Whatever you think of her merits, it‚Äôs not looking good in Nevada and South Carolina. Super Tuesday may be her last stand.
I've been listening to them for awhile and while they try to stay impartial, (possibly just me) but I do feel like they lean towards Warren. However, seemingly as time and these states go by, even they must feel how useless it is to stay on the sidelines while Warren isn't given a proper look by the media and in result the country.
They‚Äôre all Warren guys as far as I can tell.
They've favored Warren for as long as I can remember...
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I want this. I fantasize that they‚Äôre secretly text-banking for Senator Warren when they‚Äôre on the couch with their labradoodles at night. At the same time, there is currently a video on their Instagram page that says ‚ÄúBernie is on track to win the nomination‚Äù both as the lead in the caption and in giant, bold text in the opening few seconds of the video itself. I was really upset when I saw it, and I made a comment about how it was irresponsible, how the media narrative can be self-fulfilling, and that if they were going to cover it like this they were doing their part to hedge her out of the media narrative like everyone else is doing.
Yeah absolutely. Although Jon Favreau seems to lean towards Buttigieg he has been far more opaque about it.
Except Tulsi. Everyone hates Tulsi
But let‚Äôs be real: so would the supporters of Bernie, Buttigieg and Biden.
The most-listened left-wing podcast, at least. I think Shapiro gets more listens weekly. Ugh.   Either way I think the Pod bros won't endorse because they're party guys. Their podcast isn't that ideological, it's more about getting whatever Dem wins elected.
He said it (as part of a joke) in the podcast review of Iowa too   Should just make it official
Yes though this is Lovett or Leave It, which frankly is more entertaining than PSA (I listen to both)
And New Hampshire is weird. They have a lot of independents and libertarians and Massachusetts haters and, this year, people who were still undecided in the booth. Her underperforming isn‚Äôt surprising. It‚Äôs just really really bad for narrative and combatting the electability question, especially with the erasure of her showing in Iowa.  Lighting candles for Harry Reid to get off the fence because she has to get pledged delegates in Nevada
[deleted]
I heard that too, which is definitely new info to me.   Why would local media have a beef with her specifically? Perplexing to say the least.
I heard that same thing and it made me feel better!
I think her stoush with Bernie really hurt her. I've been a fan of Warren for years now but it really soured her for me.
[deleted]
They are democratic podcasters. I understand why no formal endorsement but for anyone who listens to the show, he‚Äôs made it very very clear he‚Äôs on team Warren. And those are the people who wold be swayed by that endorsement.
PSA gets a ton of shit from the far left and Bernie supporters. If you look things like Chapo trap house. Endorsing anyone but Bernie would result in more attacks on themselves from that crowd.   Trying to stay neutral is about keeping the far left on the side  of party unity. Because the far left doesn't necessarily feel the same.
It‚Äôs because they still want to be in good terms with whoever does end up being President, endorsing in the primary could make the difference between someone giving ‚Äúaccess‚Äù later or not.
>She‚Äôs said to have low minority support but she has a relatively high ‚Äúunknown‚Äù rating (17) with blacks compared to 3  It is true but my real worry is that there is not enough time to her to catch up. If there is no drastic changes from her campaign, she won't reach those voters she needs to.
[removed]
Dum dum dum dum dum dum dum.... GAY NEEWS!
The what?!
Removed: Racist Trolling.
They've been getting caught in the narratives recently, too, and have left Warren out of a lot of conversations.
Only 1.6% of delegates have been assigned. There's still time.
> I've been listening to them for awhile and while they try to stay impartial, (possibly just me) but I do feel like they lean towards Warren.   Well, Lovett in a particular. He had a line last week about how if Warren was a man she'd be up by 40 points (verdict: accurate).  He also seems to a healthy and correct disdain for Pete.
They all served in the WH while Joe was VP and at least one of the hosts is from Delaware. That being said, I do think they like Warren.
538‚Äôs model had as of yesterday predicted that Sanders or none of the above now have roughly equal chances of getting the majority of the delegates
But Bernie Sanders is on track to win the nomination...Like, three months ago, if they had stated Joe Biden was on track to win the nomination, I would have agreed with that statement as well.      They're just going with the data.
Thank you! They have broken pretty hard for Bernie lately so I am not getting where all chatter about them being secretly in Warren's camp is coming from.
Favs is a Warren guy. He was really showing it early and has since dialed back to appear more neutral.
As a Pete Stan, I just wanted to leave a comment that... Fav is definitely leaning toward Warren.  But, he became much more objective and somewhat neutral after battleground states polling showing Trump beating all frontrunners + started the Wilderness series to learn more about those voters in person.
coming this fall to the CW, lol
I saw a Tulsi sign while out driving today. The only one I've ever seen. I couldn't believe someone actually like her enough to plop a sign in their yard.
This was before I decided who was even going to vote for. There was such a large field. I can honestly feel this way about her versus the others.
I listen to Shapiro from time to time, because I try to avoid only hearing one side, but Jesus Christ he makes it hard. Not only is his voice grating, he runs ads every 5 minutes. I feel like I‚Äôm listening to terrestrial radio.
What I respect is that they view the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate as dispassionately as they can. They know, and keep on stressing, that we're all on the same team. Their dissections of Biden's weaknesses, for example, are harsh but honest. They, more than other political podcasts, have rallied an infrastructure around organizing for Democratic candidates. They've got far sight.
She's not doing herself any good by constantly shining a light on Klobuchar. I haven't seen any big moments where Amy has returned the favor. If Warren keeps at it, Klobuchar is going to be cemented in the media as the more-electable woman.
‚ÄúNew Hampshire is weird‚Äù kind of sums up where I think Warren has gone wrong. She‚Äôs not appealing to the working class. I switched from Warren to Sanders because I found her campaign to be a bit exclusionary, tbh. Perhaps not intentionally, but it‚Äôs something in her rhetoric. When she spends her time explaining how her healthcare system is going to work this seems to resonate with the college education voter, and turn off those who aren‚Äôt college educated. Something about the intellectual ‚Äúelites‚Äù explaining things, maybe. I think if she loses to Sanders in MA, which is looking possible, then she has to either figure out a new way of delivering her message or drop out.
Many NHers moved there specifically to escape Massachusetts, either because they couldn't afford MA or they didn't vibe with the culture / politics.
As they said on that episode, people think of Boston as liberal but their media is HARSH and conservative. They‚Äôve been blasting her for years, she‚Äôs as much a villain as Hillary was.
I don't think it's anything in particular, just that they have a strong right media there.
>Why would local media have a beef with her specifically? Perplexing to say the least.  The same reason why local media is hostile to progressives everywhere: wealthy owners and corporate consolidation. She's a local progressive so they spend more time focusing on her.
You‚Äôve got the narrative down. This talking point is everywhere. It‚Äôs not original or insightful. It‚Äôs a clear attempt to gaslight and tear a woman down. It‚Äôs not going to work here.
It's sad that it came down to believing him over her. Based on their emotions, I think they had a misunderstanding of what was said.
CNN thanks you for falling for their strategy.
The stoush where she was brave enough to tell the truth about a sexist thing a man said to her even though she knew she‚Äôd get blowback for it because men hate it when they‚Äôre called out?   If you think she leaked it, she obviously didn‚Äôt. CNN was shit stirring. Her camp weren‚Äôt prepared at all to handle it.
[deleted]
Does Vermont have a city as big as Boston with wide reaching radio/media?
have you forgotten that indiana & minnesota are NOT neighboring states? there's no reason amy & pete should have outperformed warren in NH except that there's no media bias *against* those two in that region. honestly if boston radio goes that hard against warren it's a goddamn miracle that she beat a republican incumbent for her senate seat in the first place.
Has everyone with your taking point forgotten that she's the senator in Mass?
Oh yeah I know, I was mainly referring to the Democratic establishment and the women‚Äôs groups who got behind Hillary immediately. Many have hinted that they believe Liz would be by far the best choice, but for whatever reason (I have theories but never mind) they‚Äôre not stumping for her the way they did for Hillary. And she really needs them to.
This isn‚Äôt true
Beating Trump should take precedence over potential future access.
There‚Äôs only been two states. Pete and Klob are gonna fall in the next two. If Bloomberg doesn‚Äôt take over I feel that many moderates will flock to Warren as a compromise.
Klobuchar turned it around in a single debate. She needs a breakout performance, and with Sanders hanging her out to dry on M4A, I think we're gonna see the gloves finally come off.
Removed: Trolling.  Yes, there is a reason we have a Primary process that includes all of the states instead of just 2 states or 3 states. We will continue the primary until a nominee is selected, and not stop at arbitrary points to give the nomination to the person who has the second most delegates after only 2% have been distributed.
Any ideas on how we could counter that? Do we just continue to drop facts about Warren on their Twitter? I'm sure every other campaign's supporters do that, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't. Of course it's about facts and being able to back it up, but we also have to find a way to gain control of the narrative again.
Very true. Personally, I just think of what else can be done. I know twitter/internet isn't exactly a reflection of real life but I'm sure media outlets still factor in data from there to gauge what type of articles to release.     I know we believe in Warren, but I'm just thinking out loud for myself. We can't just wait for the country to come to their senses when the media would rather talk about Biden's chances of winning against Bernie or Pete, while totally omitting Warren from the conversation, who is also ahead of him.
Dan Pfeiffer (and the rest, but Dan is the one from Delaware) have a soft spot for Biden, but they all definitely prefer Warren, even if they won't straight up say that on air. It's not hard to read between the lines.
[deleted]
Yeah, you can tell Favreau is a Warren guy. I haven‚Äôt listened to Lovett or Leave It, but from PSA it kinda sounds like Lovett is a Bernie supporter. I‚Äôll have to start listening to that pod!
Oh absolutely: my point was that that supporters from every candidate can sleep well with Warren as president, but the supporters of the same candidates will have problems with others but Warren.
You do you but at this point what is there left to be heard on the other side? How much more do they have to cheat and lie before everyone writes them off until they get their shit together again?
I don‚Äôt think listening to Shapiro should be described as hearing from multiple sides. That implies all parties are interested in providing good faith arguments based on a reasonably understanding of reality. Neither are typically true of Shapiro IMO.   I am not making assumptions about why you listen. I do follow popular right wing media too, though but not because I think I‚Äôll be more informed. I want to know what they are up to, and I don‚Äôt trust that regular media or law enforcement will keep track even though they are very popular.   There are actually people on the far right side of the spectrum who engage in good faith with a reasonable understanding of the facts if you want to understand their beliefs. And that can be useful to understanding what drives that belief system. They aren‚Äôt as popular though because they are true believers whereas your Shapiro‚Äôs and your Limbaugh‚Äôs are as much about selling their brand as they are about forwarding any cause.
Yes, she‚Äôs let everyone off the hook and needs to get stuck in. Bloomberg first of course, because he‚Äôs an existential threat to democracy, but Bernie and Biden too.
I think you underestimate the working class if you don't think they can understand the basics of a healthcare plan. They can. Details are important but I guess it's easier to just believe in Bernie's magic wand that doesn't require any effort (and won't get passed).
>I switched from Warren to Sanders because I found her campaign to be a bit exclusionary, tbh  I'm a Bernie > Warren supporter and even I find this statement highly ironic at face value. That said, I think you're not wrong overall. It almost seems like the access to information has made politics dumber. You need big, simple, strong ideas that can break through the noise and let people latch onto.  The plurality of the electorate isn't solidifying their picks until the last minute, nobody's doing their homework, it's just even more gut-feeling votes than ever.

The same city that protected Catholic priests who raped children for decades.  I can imagine.
Why does it have to be original? I can make up my own mind
given that she told reporters about it off the record right after it happened and then never mentioned it again, it's clear that whether there was a misunderstanding or not, neither of them felt it important enough to bring up publicly. what CNN did was dredge up those off-the-record notes from their reporters, spin them as though warren's campaign JUST came forward with it and used it to draw views for their own debate and split progressives to give centrists a path to the win. and the fact that warren took all the heat for asserting herself in a story she didn't even want to go public with is unmitigated bullshit. certainly feels like both the media and the public at large are saying "shut up, women."
What's sad is that I expect that from conservatives--just look at Blasey Ford and attempted-rapist Kavanaugh--but I expected **better** from people who claim to be liberal or progressive.  But what happened? Bernie's supporters went on a vicious attack against Warren, calling her a snake and a liar; completely misogynistic bullshit. It went well beyond a disagreement on what he meant.
Whether he said it or not (and I would argue that Bernie has greater credibility than Warren) is not really the issue. It's the handling of it.   I've loved Warren for a long time and her policies are pretty good (not as good as Bernie imo but way better than the other Dems) but the way she plays politics is really bad and this highlighted that
"As a supporter of warren of Warren for years now, the straw that broke the camel's back for me was her having the audacity to speak up for herself against a man. I prefer that the leader of the free world be meek and submissive- that is unless that leader happens to have a penis which makes projecting boundaries and strength commendable rather than a drawback."
The story is Bernie leaked it now is it?
I know. It's frustrating because a lot of these same organizations hold back out of respect for the voters. Where as some of the more corrosive elements of our coalition treat voters as though they are pieces on a game board, it's hard to watch the team players in the Democratic Party hesitate to express an opinion, but indicate heavily their respect for Sen. Warren.  That's the way it goes though. We all know that Sen. Warren has been facing major league pitching this whole primary and a lot of these other guys have been playing AA ball.
But she's not Hillary, she's a fundamental threat to the status quo, to the banks, to Democratic mega-donors. Thus, if you're a wealthy power broker whose material interests are aligned with the status quo, she's literally only preferable to Sanders because then we're in wild uncharted territory and nobody knows what's going to happen.  Every article I read last year about all the clandestine dinner meetings of the democratic leadership and donors about how to stop Sanders or who they should get behind included explicit dislike of Warren. Essentially that Warren was unacceptable but Bernie was unthinkable.  A lot of people in the Democratic party would rather have a check from Michael Bloomberg today and roll the dice in November than let Elizabeth Warren have real power.
If they were capable of that level of interest in the public good, most of them wouldn't be politicians in the first place. We have a broken political system that disproportionately raises self-interested narcissists to the highest levels of power.
I no longer take anything for granted. Amy wasn't going to do well in NH until she did. Warren was expected to do better and she didn't  I am looking for tangible ways the campaign can do better, not make assumptions based on polls. The last time I looked at SC, Warren wasn't doing so hot there and Pete is catching on in NV. He apparently has the best Caucusing directors in the race which explains his overperformance in IA. Since he has the forethought of hiring such people, I won't count discount him as easily as many are inclined to do.
I think short of a major win in one of the states or a huge fundraising/endorsement news (like, Obama says the party should unite under her), Warren isn't going to get much airtime. Media has already counted her out after Iowa and since she's not attacking, they're not going to devote any air time to her. They want drama and she's not playing that game anymore.
There is a decent chance that no single candidate will get the 1990 state delegates necessary to win the nomination. That will mean that whoever has the most delegates will need to make a deal with one or more of the lower-ranked candidates and form a coalition. The longer Warren stays in, the more power she has to shift the nationwide conversation toward her policies and goals. Regardless of whether she's the frontrunner, her voice is influential and necessary. She should stay in as long as she can.
Journalist live online, and newsroom budgets are scant. What you get is a lot of cheap reporting that regurgitates what journalists are reading on Twitter, which most Americans don‚Äôt use.   They literally create narratives out of whole cloth, and then average people see snippets because people won‚Äôt pay for news anymore. They think the snippets actually reflect reality.
New: Ayanna Pressley is backing Elizabeth Warren
[deleted]
Ohhhh shit. That's big. You knew something was up when she didn't endorse Bernie with the rest of the squad. Makes sense given they're from the same congressional delegation. Also I'm sure she might want to run for Warren's seat should she step down after becoming the nominee.
As a Bernie supporter, I am happy for both of them and know we'll all be on the same team next summer.
Saw a lot of Bernie people calling her a sellout. Both Bernie and Warren are good candidates and it is great that Warren has her endorsement.
In the end, the ‚Äúsquad‚Äù all predictably backed progressive candidates, and that‚Äôs good for us all.
This is a really wonderful day for this endorsement. Yesterday we had our City Council elections and [many progressive women and people of color won seats](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/boston-city-council-change.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&fbclid=IwAR1L7Qgs2zuk6N-slF-yGJVfebP-fs61JT5AL7qRABNKsRjZxcmIQVZls4g). One of them, absolute fucking rockstar Michelle Wu, is a prominent Warren surrogate and former student. Warren and already Pressley have both had a huge influence on the new generation of progressive leadership in this state. Warren is our first female Senator. Pressley is our first black congresswoman, and she had her come-up on the City Council as well. This is an ICONIC duo for MA politics.
[deleted]
I‚Äôve said it since the election: Ayanna Pressley is the true all-star of the freshman class. She may not make as many waves as others in the media, but she is as principled as they come, sticks up for those who need representation most, and knows how to get things done at every level. I was proud of her as my city counsilor, and I‚Äôm proud to call Ayanna my congresswoman.
[deleted]
https://twitter.com/AyannaPressley/status/1192132941335449601  here's the video!  woooo edit: she's got so much swagger in this video.
Its going to be interesting watching the Harris Twitter fans telling this black woman that Warren doesnt care about issues that affect black women and the black community.
Yes!!
It's always been a bit borderline to consider the squad
They are both MA congress peeps. I can see it.
Who is she?
[deleted]
[removed]
Hell yes they are sticking together. People don‚Äôt cut ties in politics based on endorsements
AOC said herself that she still supports both Bernie and Liz.
Unsurprising given the Liz - Bernie dynamic. At the end of the day, their visions for America overlap quite nicely. It‚Äôs more a question of what we think the process most likely to achieve that vision is.
You can be friends and still think differently. Level headed people. Love it.
  Jeeeeeesus. People are really trying to push that a purple heart emoji is AOC calling Pressley a centrist. I'm going back to bed.
I wish more of the vocal Bernie supporters would follow AOC's example like this. Not necessarily heart emojis, but definitely less of "HOW COULD U, BERNIE'S THE TRUE PROGRESSIVE, U SELLOUT"
I didn't have any doubt that they would. It isn't 2016, some people try and stoke the "my candidate or its rigged" flames but they tend to be trolls.
Of course they are, AOC said herself we are all on the same team.
I thought for sure Rashida was going to endorse warren when she held back hers too. But then she did it a week later. Warren made multiple visits to Detroit and her district to highlight redlining, auto union strike, and environmental racism.
[deleted]
> Also I'm sure she might want to run for Warren's seat should she step down after becoming the nominee.  ding ding ding   Although I think Joe Kennedy would vie for it as well, if the Markey challenge fails
How is this big when the AOC and Ilhan's Bernie endorsement were considered nbd on this sub a few weeks ago?
[removed]
Amen.
(Not all) but many of the most vocal Bernie Supporters really jump to excommunicate people that support Senator Warren. (Presley, and Krasner for example) hell they were starting to get antsy on r/AOC.
Ignore those clowns.  Most informed Bernie supporters knew this was coming, and have no hard feelings at all. Good for Liz.
I like Bernie and Warren pretty similarly, and honestly I'd be subscribed to their subreddit too if they weren't such asshats. Twitter is similar too. IRL Bernie supporters are fine though.  But yeah... I kind of called this from a mile away. Pressley is not only from her state but is also from the neighboring district. Politicians from the same state have incentives to follow each other.  I also think Pressley's vibe is a little more, for lack of a better term "establishment friendly". Warren:Sanders::Pressley:AOC in other words. And she's had a longer history in politics too.
Those people need to learn to stop being stupid. Pressely has the right to support whoever she wants.
I love Michelle Wu's support videos.  She not only comes across as highly engaged and intelligent, but really joyful about working to improve our country through the political process.
I listened to her interview on Pod Save America a few weeks ago and I was incredibly impressed by her. She has big things in her future. (Like maybe a senate seat vacated by President Warren?)
Yes, she is great. By far the most level of "The Squad" - she's a lot less preoccupied with the Twitterverse and more plugged into on-the-ground politics and policy.

That sub is one big echo chamber
Ayanna is always dripping swag
... um  https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/27/rashida-tlaib-endorses-bernie-sanders-president/2454880001/
Tlaib already endorsed Sanders. Jayapal is interesting. She got into office in 2016 being supported by Bernie. Rode the progressive wave in Washington state in 2016. Since in office has been close with Pelosi and dem establishment. Her big thing is Med4All. She did support Warren‚Äôs proposals. My honest guess is that she might stay neutral until major activity happens in the race.
It‚Äôs almost like people don‚Äôt have to agree on 100% of everything to get along!
She went further than that, she tweeted we are very lucky to have two strong progressive front runners.
Actually, I think it's the other way around. The "process" is similar (though there are still differences), but the long-term vision and world-view is different between the two, one believes that the system we have is beyond fixing and envisions long term moving to an economic system not based on profit and exploitation above-all-else, the other believes in the economic system that we have but wants to improve on it.  /Bernie supporter (and socialist) sneaking in to have a look at what you guys are saying about this. Warren would make a decent president, certainly better than all the others other than Bernie, and I would vote for her and possibly even campaign for her (depending on her stances in the general) if she were the candidate, but the differences between them should not be understated.
You didn't get the memo that everyone not named Bernie Sanders is a centrist?
I love Bernie, I voted for him in 2016 and would happily vote for him if he is the nominee but I agree.  It has honestly turned me off a bit from him.
I know a couple of these folks in real life. Different people then in my other comment. I tend to avoid political convos with them because hearing about everything being the deep state and excessive use of MSM does my head in.

Exactly. This was expected all around.
I am pretty angry with Joe Kennedy for challenging Ed Markey for his seat. Markey has done so much good for this country and seems like a such a decent human being. He is one of my favorite senators. There are plenty of awful people in congress Kennedy could have chosen to challenge. He needs to back the F off and earn his place in the senate not attempt to force out one of the best.
I think Pressley would be the favourite in replacing Warren.
I just joined this sub a week ago or so, but I think those were big deals too.
Name a quicker way to get people to discount your opinion than calling someone else part of the establishment.

I know most Bernie supporters are fine, but the obnoxious ones are very aggravating.
Thank you!  From a comment section on a Secular Talk video about Bernie vs. Warren:  1. "When will we stop saying "we'll wait until Elizabeth Warren clarifies her positions"?! She's unclear and vague ON PURPOSE. That already says so much about her. I'll take the guy that's been clear about his positions since the 1960s".    2. 'Warren's theory of change: "we must change.... kinda"'.    3. "Warren: just beg the rich people to ve less cruel.    Bernie: the elites won't go down unless we fight them."    These are Trump levels of delusion. These guys live in fantasyland. They're just idiots.
Maura Healey will also have a strong shot at the senate seat. But Ayanna is amazing. Would be nice to have two great choices in a primary like that.
AOC is pretty plugged into the on the ground stuff. She won because her whole campaign was on the ground. She‚Äôs also a great questioner in committee hearings.
If "establishment" is supposed to be an insult then what do you think of people like me who went into the public service "establishment" specifically because we wanted to make change and know that the best way to change a system is from within?
Jayapal co-chairs the House Progressive Caucus, and has a lot more at stake in terms of political captial than some of these others. It would be crazy for her to do anything other than stay neutral for the time being.
Bernie supporter here. Agree with this 100 percent. Both Warren and Bernie would be a god send if we could get either in.
As I think of it, economic systems are processes while a society with an uplifted lower class and understated upper class is the result. In other words, it kinda comes down to semantics.
> an economic system not based on profit and exploitation  Would you mind my asking what are some policy differences between Sanders and Warren that illustrate this philosophy?
heck someone must have forgotten to cc me on that one.
In Europe, even Bernie would be a centrist. As a Bernie supporter, I'm happy to refer to him as a centrist.  His policies and Warren's are preferred by most Americans. That makes them both centrists when you're measuring stick is the American public.   Yay centrists !!!
I was undecided for much of the the 2016 primaries and several close friends were very rudely dismissive the second they learned I hadn't cancelled Hillary. I was more aligned with Bernie on policy but that kind of behavior really kept me from getting fully on board in 2016 and it's one of the things that's keeping him at a distant second for me. Have a friend who lives on the opposite side of the country who had the same experience.
Yup that's exactly my story.
> Liz refused to commit to some key issues   which are those? anyway fascinating insight
What were those mistakes?
Can you elaborate?
Seems very logical to me, Sanders has the support of every other Muslim in Congress, Omar, Ellison.  He is very strong among muslims nationally.  Tlaib donor networks are heavily muslims nationally, it would be very unusual for Tlaib to not endorse Sanders.
[deleted]
And the other two?
See, I like Markey, but I also like Joe Kennedy a lot and do kind of vibe with getting younger leaders in the Senate. Markey has been in Congress since the 70s.
Well Chuck Baker would get the appointment, so no. And I suspect Kennedy would beat her in 22
Ya this sub is weird sometimes

Compromising with others and working through existing political mechanisms doesn't mean a lack of principle. Similarly, casting blanket accusations against the party you'd theoretically work with and insisting on your way above all else doesn't indicate principle.
That‚Äôs also why they don‚Äôt get anything done. They don‚Äôt coalition build and alienate people who would be and should be allies.
Are you suggesting that Warren supporters have no principles, don't know what we want, and aren't aggressive in pursuing it?  I'll agree maybe on the last one. But that's because I know what I want, and that's Elizabeth Warren‚Äîa level-headed planner who has already shown an ability to fight corruption and create change. The last thing I want is more needless aggression, I get enough anger and shouting from the current POTUS, I'm not trying to win with more angry shouting.  This is coming from a 2016 Bernie supporter.
They lack principles because they vote for incremental change? . . . Like Senator Sanders?
Yeah, bad apples.   If you check Twitter there is a large contingent of Bernie supporters proactively stating that "cancelling pressley" over this is pathetic and wrong.
Why not Martha Coakley? Third time's the charm!

Love me some AOC too :)
I'd say that you're misunderstanding the connotation of the word and reacting defensively. Also, I'd say that I don't currently have enough information about you to make some sort of judgement either way.  It seems like you'd qualify every politician as establishment based on how you're using it?
IMO party leadership should keep their mouths shut on these things. So Jayapal is doing the right thing. Making it seem like "the party" is deciding makes the whole process look illegitimate in the eyes of people on the losing end.
I would advise you to read up on his issue pages on workplace democracy and corporate accountability and democracy:  [https://berniesanders.com/issues/workplace-democracy/](https://berniesanders.com/issues/workplace-democracy/)  [https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/](https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/)
> In Europe, even Bernie would be a centrist.  Where in Europe exactly? In Germany and France the classic "centrists" are people like Merkel and Macron. Sanders is solidly on the Left basically everywhere. Unless your personal definition of centrism is "anyone who isn't part of the Marxist Leninist vanguard" this doesn't make sense.

So I live in Belgium and work in policy, and I hear this all the time, and it really isn't true.  American politics don't map neatly onto the politics of Europe, due to the huge differences in history, culture, and representation in parliamentary systems. For example, the social democracies of Scandinavia are very much of the left wing compared to the US in tax policy, but they are also really strongly free trade focused, well to the right (though it really isn't a left-right issue tbh) of Bernie on trade policy. The main political arguments in the US aren't really big points in Europe for the most part. Support for state programs like healthcare and education isn't a left-right issue in Europe, it's an accepted default. Even the far right in Europe supports these things - you surely wouldn't suggest that the ultra-right parties like the AfD or Vlaams Belang are left of the Democratic Party, right?  Yes, healthcare is universal and education is paid for, but there are a bunch of issues that go the other way or, more commonly, don't fit on the US left-right spectrum at all. I know that people are trying to move the Overton window when they bring this talking point up, but it's really a massive oversimplification.

Her only flaw :)
I think Bailey was a gift from her husband? So technically it was his choice.
Says the person who has time to ask that?
Not saying it isn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs sad to think that Bailey being in the WH will mean thousands more rescues go unadopted because Golden Retrievers are more in-demand and thousands more dogs are abandoned each January because it‚Äôs cool to give a puppy as a Christmas present. Wish EW would just acknowledge adopt-don‚Äôt-shop is better for dogs in general.
True, but thousands of dogs are abandoned every January because either breeders ‚Äúoverproduced‚Äù for the holidays or unprepared people were gifted a puppy for Christmas.   It‚Äôs a sad thing, and a Christmas-gift purebred in the White House will only up demand for more.
I'm a mod.  I'd rather not be wasting my time removing dealing with trolls, but that's the job.  If you stop trolling we can both dedicate our time to more useful things.  Win-win.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in to help raise $24.6 million in the third fundraising quarter. Together, we‚Äôre building a movement that‚Äôs going to put power back in the hands of the people.‚Äù
> Campaign manager Roger Lau, in an email to supporters, said more than 500,000 people made more than 940,000 contributions to the campaign during the third quarter. The majority of those donors -- **300,000 -- gave to Warren for the first time during that period**, Lau said, for an average contribution of $26. Since she entered the race on New Year's Eve, an estimated **750,000 people have given to Warren's campaign.**  That's amazing! The momentum continues!  &nbsp;  Hey folks, I know we're glad about the fundraising number. Our sub's goal is to double the amount of donations by this subreddit (500 donations) by the end of Q4 (December). Can we do that? I think we will!  Here's the donation link if you are interested: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/redditforwarren.  You'll get a donor flair if you do!
Oof.  I regret not pitching in a little more when I had the chance. Oh well.  Definitely will be donating more this quarter.
That brings the year's numbers to: 1,800,000+ contributions from 750,000+ *individual donors* for a grand total of ~$50,000,000 (Senate campaign transfer not included). That's an average of $27 per donation, $66 per donor.  This is a grassroots movement.
https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1180135696658550787  Warren raised the second most of any candidate, behind Bernie by $700k. She also has $25.7 million cash on hand, which is arguably a more important number.
Bernie supporter here. It warms my heart to see the two progressive candidates having the most fundraising out of the whole field while Biden is 10 million behind both. Congrats warren! Progressives are grass roots funded!
~~I think I'm shadow banned on here, but posting anyway...~~  Sanders/Warren: $49.9m vs: Buttigieg/Biden/Harris: $45.3m  [https://twitter.com/ryanobles/status/1180138071892869120](https://twitter.com/ryanobles/status/1180138071892869120)
Also Biden had a piss poor Q3 at some $15 million. The progressive movement is strong, people!
*Darth Vader voice* Impressive.  Most impressive.   She raise about what, 19 million last quarter? That‚Äôs a five million gain.  If that‚Äôs the case she had the second highest growth of any candidate
Alright I'm gonna set up my recurring monthly donation this weekend. Was gonna wait until a clear leader emerged on the Democratic side. It looks like it's time.
Next quarter let‚Äôs make her #1.
I hope that these results, for both Warren and Sanders and especially the two combined, puts the stupid ‚ÄúBiden is most electable‚Äù narrative to rest.
Amazing news!!! Love how the 2 progressive candidates are dominating the field!  Just like her polling figures, her fundraising numbers are only rising and soon will be #1!
I wish all of us feeling both Warren and Bernie could join forces NOW and shut Biden down.
Great number for Liz obviously but it‚Äôs really sad that we‚Äôre lighting all this money on fire in a primary that could be better spent in the general or especially in Senate races.
Seeing such strong grassroots support, I'm still baffled as to why she's still committed to taking in corporate/special interest money in the general election.
No regrets. This was an outstanding quarter for the campaign and caps off a great couple months of other really good news for those of us who support Warren. We just need to keep up this momentum through February!
The fact that she has 750,000 individual donors is incredible! She had to build that movement from the ground up   We might get 1 million individual donors by the end of Q4.
$27 per donation? I've heard that number before...  I'm all in on Bernie, but excited to see Warren pulling similar numbers.  It shows just how strong the progressive movement is.
And that cash on hand is after already making a couple large TV ad buys for February!
The cash on hand is very close to what Bernie and Clinton had at the end of Q3 in 2015 even though they were only two - so that's pretty good!   [https://www.businessinsider.com/q3-presidential-candidate-fundraising-2015-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/q3-presidential-candidate-fundraising-2015-10)
The progressives are on the move... it's so nice to see. Inspiring.   Get out there sisters and brothers, we got a lot of work ahead!
>She also has $25.7 million cash on hand, which is arguably a more important number.  Yeah, money raised is important but cash on hand is vital going in to Q4.
Biden in at *$15 mil*. Wow.

Progressives should be happy with these numbers in general. Our grassroots movement is growing.
ur not  &#x200B;  and ikr
It'll be interesting to see how fundraising has evolved along the quarter. We'll have to wait until Oct 15 for that.I'm hoping for an article like this one:  [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/17/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/17/us/politics/2020-democratic-fundraising.html)
you're not shadowbanned
That‚Äôs really bad for Biden. He didn‚Äôt raise that much more than Yang who brought in $10 million. Between these numbers and his recently falling polling numbers, he might have an even tougher time fundraising this quarter. It seems much of the big donor money is going to Buttigieg now.
It's pretty rough lol. It shows that people really aren't that enthusiastic about Biden
I think it is super important that her donations are growing as well as her polling. She is the candidate that continues to grow on every metric.
That would make the biggest gain belong to Yang at over $7 million. That‚Äôs really impressive.
Trump is going hard on negative Biden ads. We'll have to see what affect it will have on Biden's voting block.
Warren just spent a ton of money on down-ballot races, especially in Maine to take out Susan Collins. We can only make change if Democrats take the majority.
She‚Äôs not taking ‚Äúspecial interest money‚Äù in the general election. You are misinterpreting the widely circulated videos out of context.  She said she would lift her ban on high-dollar *fundraisers*. That‚Äôs something Sanders has also banned (but also kind of still been doing with his ticketed fundraisers with limited $27 tickets and then the rest being $100 to $2800). But it means she would commit to hosting those ticketed fundraisers for up to $2800 on the general (same as Sanders, Yang, etc.). In these cases, ‚Äúbig money‚Äù isn‚Äôt a huge difference for donors. Both Bill Gates and I are capped at $2800 per cycle. The only way for them to donate more money would be to donate their money to a PAC, which she has maintained a ban on through the general election.  More details and reading found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/cjcguc/the_case_for_warren_from_the_left/).
Small donor donations are a luxury. We are not in a place and time to be picky about how we beat Trump. If he wins a second term he's going to rip this country apart. Obamacare will be gone. Abortion rights gone. Migrant children will die. The climate will be fucked. The courts will be stuffed for a century. He will break campaign finance laws. He will solicit help from other nations. He will take money from every shady corporation and dark money group possible. He will cheat and lie and obstruct and disenfranchise his way to a second term given the chance. Now is not the time to clutch pearls about campaign funding purity.  If the other guy is using a dirty bomb you don't restrict yourself to using a BB gun.  If Warren thinks she can beat him without big donations then more power to her, but the number one priority is beating Trump. Whatever it takes.
In the same time period that Warren and Bernie got ~$50M in small donations, Trump pulled in $124M.  And Trump doesn't need to spend any of it on a primary.  Whoever the Democratic candidate is, they're going to be in a massive hole, and while money isn't everything, it's also not nothing.  But think of it this way.  Senator Warren, who was doing normal sorts of fundraising, was calling for businesses to be broken up and their CEOs jailed.  If that's the corruptive power of money, I don't think any of us has to worry.
So far, Warren's gotten \~300,000 new donors in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Adding another 250,000 by December is totally doable!
Imagine unironically calling Warren progressive
She‚Äôs one of only 2 candidates I‚Äôve seen running TV ads here in SC so far, and the other doesn‚Äôt really count because it‚Äôs Tom Steyer.
I know it's easy to get frustrated with the Bernie or Bust mentality we see from online commentators, but the truth is that most people don't think like that. We should all be fighting for both candidates to have the strongest following among the field. Many Bernie followers will happily support Warren if she's the nominee, we should be supportive, not shut them out. I know I personally can certainly be better in that regard.
Come on dude. Fuck off with that divisive bullshit.  Celebrate Warren. Don‚Äôt shit on other Dems. Be like Warren
Removed for rule 4.
Way to be divisive
Dirty is a loaded word. It's money from her Senate campaign which yes, did include money from sources other than individual donors.
Yeah, how dare she spend the money we donated to her for what we knew it would be spent on!   We wanted her to keep it and swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck instead. You know, be responsible with it.
Didn‚Äôt Sanders do the same thing?
These kind of purity politics don‚Äôt help anyone.
Damn straight. I can't wait to vote for either Bernie or Warren in the GE. I honestly did not think we would ever be in a position where not one but two progressive candidates are increasingly likely to take the nom.
Ah, it must just be posts then.. good insight into the race by looking at it broken down like that (Sanders/Warren vs the rest of the field).
Pete's gonna overperform in Iowa, and so will Yang I think. That does not bode well for Biden.
That honestly is, he has a hardcore of supporters.
I never in a million years expected it. I don't know if it's his demeanor or his UBI. I don't believe UBI is the best antidote to automation, but he is cool.
Thanks for trying to clear up some of the misunderstanding. The other two commenters were just making excuses for what was apparently a false statement of mine.
Imagine not being a dick to people we might have to ask to vote for Bernie in the General. Do you want to fundamentally change the course of justice in this country or do you want to be a smug child?  Imagine unironically calling YOURSELF a progressive.
Keep doing gods work PeanutButterSmears.
Bernie isn‚Äôt a Dem but I‚Äôm celebrating him anyways!
[removed]
So it's not true that she hasn't taken money from special interest then is it?
Yes.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/30/are-sanders-warren-grassroots-funded/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/30/are-sanders-warren-grassroots-funded/)
How would that impact whether or not it's morally correct?  Shouldn't we be calling out everyone?
I know, so excited by this.  Sanders best quarterly haul in 2016 was (I think) about $33 million. This quarter the candidates running truly grassroots campaigns (Sanders, Warren and Yang) surpassed $60 million. The movement to address our country's problems with bold proposals is growing. People are ready for change.
There might be an approval process in place for posts to cut down on spam and people intentionally campaigning for other candidates here. There's one group in particular that likes "asking questions" only to turn around and promote their candidate's single policy.
I hope. As someone who is all-in for Warren my ideal result in Iowa is that Warren wins with Pete taking second. That will really hurt Biden‚Äôs main argument of electability.
I‚Äôm in his Basecamp group on Facebook because my friend added me. His online support is definitely strong!
Tbh, I personally don‚Äôt mind PAC money. They barely made up 1% of Warren‚Äôs Senate campaign contributions, and also barely made up 0.5% of Clinton‚Äôs in 2016 general. It‚Äôs hardly anything, and to top it off, Warren never received more than 15% of said PC money from business PACs ‚Äî most of the ‚ÄúPAC‚Äù money was from ideological groups like Planned Parenthood and EMILY‚Äôs List dedicated to reproductive rights.  But if Warren wants to ban them, I‚Äôm all in for that!  Money doesn‚Äôt even buy influence anyways, ACCESS does. Getting a $2800 check in the mail doesn‚Äôt make anyone likely to support you a lot in a big race like this (the smaller and more local races get, the more money starts mattering just a little more). It‚Äôs the closed-door fundraisers, some drinks, some music and dancing and schmoozing, where the influence really comes in. And Warren swore off those for the primary and has also sworn to forgo special access even if she had to have such fundraisers in the general, and keep them open-door. That‚Äôs the important thing she got right in my opinion.
Come on, you know that Warren's just another center-right Democrat. The mentality is just "beat trump". How's that going to convince people to vote for her? Doesn't she also want sanctions on Venezuela? Not very progressive, eh? Sure. She's far better than Biden, Trump, or any of the others, but if she gets elected she's just going to be another Obama.
While I too am annoyed he won‚Äôt join the party and work within it, I do always appreciate that he runs for President as a Democrat instead of becoming a non viable third-party option that would just help elect Trump.
Removed for rule 4.
>Biden I‚Äôm totally being divisive  That‚Äôs Joe ‚Äú4th place in fundraising because all the mega donors maxed out and i don‚Äôt have enthusiasm‚Äù Biden to you
Not new money this cycle.
Somehow I doubt you're calling out everyone.
There's a real sense of frustration amongst so many people, and it's not just in the US. There's a reason Trump won (well, apart from Clinton's campaign choices, the electoral college and Russian interference), he tapped into this groundswell of support from people who have been left behind by the explosion of wealth and power from the very top of society. We are increasingly left behind when new wealth is made, and find ourselves with fewer hours, less security, lower wages, and higher debts than ever before. Something had to give. This amazing support from grassroots for progressive and untypical candidates is just one sign of many.   We need to support candidates who advocate real changes to the system, because the system does not work for the average person.
Yang truly was impressive as well. I‚Äôm hoping a Warren administration would bring him on board to tackle AI and automation issues and provide input on specific issues like VATs.
That was my thought as well... which is a fair policy
I'm okay with that because I think either Warren or Buttigieg would be a stronger nominee and better president than Biden.
I think it's actually better to have Warren first, then Biden at a fair distance second, then Buttigieg. If Buttigieg is above Biden, you're going to have the donor class rally to Buttigieg in no time and abandon Biden.
[removed]
in what world is Warren  ‚Äúcenter-right‚Äù ? pls gtfo
I‚Äôm perfectly fine with that. I think Warren beats Buttigieg much more easily than Biden. Right now a lot of Democrats prefer Biden out of fear that he‚Äôs the only candidate that can beat Trump. I think with that argument out of the way, Warren does really well and starts to bring a lot of different Democratic groups together. The donor class isn‚Äôt going to support her no matter what until the general. I‚Äôd rather have them supporting Buttigieg than Biden.
> If Buttigieg is above Biden, you're going to have the donor class rally to Buttigieg in no time and abandon Biden.  Hmm, not seeing the downside here....
>If Buttigieg is above Biden, you're going to have the donor class rally to Buttigieg in no time and abandon Biden.  That's already happened. Buttigieg, despite polling in the low single digits, has pulled in more money the last two quarters than any other candidate.
Same. But there isn‚Äôt a single viable candidate who has done that in the past. At the end of the day, until we reform campaign finance and overturn Citizens United, at a certain point we need all the money we can get to defeat the SuperPACs and corporate interests backing the GOP right now.
In a world where you don't know what you're talking about.
Well I'm from New Zealand, she would be centre right there.
I am thinking about it and you may be right in terms of strategy. I may have just grown sour on Buttigieg in the past few weeks that it's making me biased.
It's crazy they think that way. Biden has more of a checkered past than Hillary Clinton. There's lots for the Republicans to target, which makes it even crazier that Trump had to ask Ukraine to make shit up that was the same as what his own kids were doing. Even though Warren is ahead nationally, Biden is still leading against Trump.
The downside for me would be that Buttigieg may be a stronger competitor than Biden as the primary progresses. But then I kept thinking about it and given Buttigieg's weaknesses in SC and NV, he may actually be weaker.
"But there isn't a single viable candidate who has done that in the past." Bernie Sanders? From my understanding, the only PAC money he's ever received has been from labor unions.  "At a certain point we need all the money we can get to defeat the SuperPACs and corporate interests backing the GOP right now"  And that's exactly why [Democrats lost over 1000 seats throughout the Obama administration](https://www.quorum.us/data-driven-insights/under-obama-democrats-suffer-largest-loss-in-power-since-eisenhower/291/). Ask yourself this, why is it that currently the most well know democratic representative in the house is AOC? She is a principled democrat who only accepts money from small dollar donations, and has been principled in her actions. All the Republicans can say about her is "sHe A SOcialIst!" and "VeNeZuELa!".  Should Warren become the nominee and start taking in big dollar donations from billionaire hosted fundraisers as she has done in the past, Trump and the Republicans are going to correctly bash her over the head with her hypocrisy about getting rid of money in politics.
So you're not voting in this upcoming US election with US politics? Why the fuck are you here???
Buttigieg definitely isn‚Äôt my second favorite candidate. I do like him more than Biden but that‚Äôs a fairly low bar for me.
> It‚Äôs crazy they think that way. Biden has more of a checkered past than Hillary Clinton.   I agree. I think Biden is possibly our riskiest possible candidate because of this. He is like a more problematic Hillary Clinton with less upside in my opinion. They think this right now because he‚Äôs a straight, white man with a lot of name recognition.   > Even though Warren is ahead nationally, Biden is still leading against Trump.  It‚Äôs really not even worth looking at these early, hypothetical general election polls. [They mean nothing.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-we-take-these-early-general-election-polls-seriously-no/)  I believe Warren will have the best chance in the general which is why I support her. I think she has policies people can get excited for and will turn out to vote for. I think she won‚Äôt suffer from some of Biden and Clinton‚Äôs weaknesses where many voters decided there was no point in voting or are willing to vote third party because they don‚Äôt like either choice. You **have** to give people something to vote **for**. We will not win by saying ‚ÄúTrump is bad. Vote for me to replace him with someone not so bad.‚Äù and that seems to be the Biden campaign‚Äôs main argument.   I also believe Warren is uniquely skilled at explaining the root cause of problems and her policy solutions in a way average Americans can understand.
That's a fair point. Warren's my #1, and Buttigieg is my #2 (along with Booker), so I would rather the top 2 be Warren and Buttigieg, just because then I will be happy with whoever wins (although I would be happier with Warren, of course).
Bernie Sanders has hosted high-dollar fundraisers and taken PAC money and played by the same rules until Warren led with her pledge (and Sanders followed) this year, actually.  You should read the thread I sent you. ‚ÄúHigh dollar fundraiser‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúschmooze with the high dollar donors‚Äù. It means Warren lifting the ban on ticketed fundraisers that Sanders has continued to use, with the ‚Äúworkaround‚Äù being that some of the tickets were priced at $27 (but when those ran out, the prices jumped back to high-dollar prices again).
I didn't say that, I said I am originally from NZ. I'm living in the US now
I feel the same way. Pete's social media has just gotten kind of pretentious lately, as he's trying to gain the Obama-type appeal.
[deleted]
That‚Äôs just kind of my least favorite thing about him in general. He seems like a really smart guy and I respect his career so far. But a couple months ago I read an article about his life story and his coming out story.   First I think that it was great that he came out and was brave of him knowing his political ambitions to do that. But reading about his younger years, he has been living his entire life towards the goal of becoming President. Everything he has done other than that, has all been to make himself a better Presidential candidate someday.   I don‚Äôt know why for sure, but that just kind of turns me off a little bit. I prefer a candidate with a compelling reason for running, not someone who is running because he‚Äôs always wanted to be President.
Warren only presidential candidate participating in first national gathering of Muslim Americans in politics.
As usual, she beats the rest of the pack to the punch. It's because she's authentic, and I love her candidacy more and more every day. I'm so glad I reset my support for Warren.
She just gets better and better.
Is Biden‚Äôs strategy just to avoid every single event except the absolutely vital ones? It really feels like he sees this as a lazy stroll that he doesn‚Äôt need to put effort into.
[deleted]
I truly love Liz I can‚Äôt wait until she‚Äôs President
This speaks volumes... and it should be reported in the press.
I think it's great that she's doing this, and it shows where her priorities are - on treating people like people, no matter who they are. On the other hand, I don't think this is an "attack ad" on the others, they all have very busy schedules and I'm sure none would say they wouldn't go if they could. I see it as a positive for her, but not a negative on the others who couldn't make it
knowledge of other viewpoints is ammunition in your bid to win an election.
Rather misleading title, if other candidates are sending videos then they are still participating.
>Biden and Bill de Blasio ‚Äï ignored the invitation.   >   >Kamala, Buttigiege, Castro ---refused the invite  Do you guys believe it's a good look for Warren to attend this event? Especially over live stream?
[removed]
Yes, authenticity is key, 100%. I think if we can learn anything from the horror of 2016, it's that it was a referendum on the way politicians typically campaign. In the age of social media and getting to know celebrities as real people, the pandering and "look, I'm just like you, I have \[popular product\] and I love \[insert name of famous local eatery\]!" just doesn't fly anymore.   I love Liz because she could go to, let's say, Philly and go to Wawa and actually say, "I liked the coffee okay, but to me, nothing beats Dunkin Donuts" and I respect the hell out of that.
She also has a lot more free time since she doesn't have to zip from fundraiser to fundraiser.
I don't doubt her authenticity, but I think this is much more about her actually doing the work.  She's always been an incredibly hard worker and direct. I think she's realized very few in Congress are hard workers. Most are just good campaigners and fundraisers who know how to do what they're donors tell them to do. She has stepped up. She's doing the work the job requires.  I feel the same is true of AOC. There's a reason her questions stand out. She has done the work to know what she needs to say to expose just how bad things really are.  It's wonderful seeing representatives that are passionate about doing the right thing and committed to actually making it happen.
 [https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/1109509936680075269?lang=en](https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/1109509936680075269?lang=en)
He spent almost 300K on private jets last quarter to fly around to closed door fundraisers.
I feel he is expecting to get the nomination off the back of Obama now and it‚Äôs not working.
He‚Äôs a good speaker, but maybe they‚Äôre realizing what he has to say is a little outdated. Maybe he‚Äôs just using the Hillary strategy and trying to just do as little damage as possible and run out the clock.
It's better for the environment this way.
It is what it is. If it generates negative attention for others that‚Äôs on them for not showing up, or even sending a video. Warren is doing her part focusing on her campaign and not whining to the media about other campaigns, I love that. Her style seems to be paying off really well.
Big difference between "Hi, I'm ______ and I think you guys are great" vs "Hi guys, sorry I can't be there in person, but I'd love to answer any questions you guys might have for me"
Yes.
Because she wants to hear their concerns and wants to represent and act in the best interests of all Americans.
First, she cares. She shows this by attending.  Second, if she's going to be representing them, she has everything to do with them. That's how a representative government is supposed to work...
[deleted]
I can't respect that because Dunkin is garbage (born and raised in New England here, so I can say that), but I agree with your general point.
That's something Bernie could make good use of as well, since he doesn't do fundraisers either. Surprisingly, as much as I love and support him, he hasn't gone above and beyond the way Warren has.
She's definitely one of our hardest working senators, and it shows in the thoroughness of her questioning. I actually disagree that other members of Congress, at least in the Democratic side, aren't putting in the legislative effort. She just happens to stand out so much that it seems that way!
I'm glad Bernie did that. Warren speaking at a nationwide conference is still noteworthy, even if she's doing it remotely. My comment is not to imply Warren is better than Bernie, but rather more candidates can and should go above and beyond.
The amount of waste in the American political system is s.t.a.g.g.e.r.i.n.g
Eh, I think the carbon emissions for a flight (to D.C.) are worth the face time for a presidential candidate.  She's got a leg up because everyone else is worse, but if that weren't the case a telecon does look much less engaged.
Making policy with religious considerations isn't something I'm going to support. Let the GOP do that garbage.
If it's not a religious event, why call it one? Arab Americans in politics would suffice if it wasn't about religion. As an ethnic minority, they are treated extremely unfairly, and need support in that respect. I'm not denying that at all. But acting like Islam is something we need to see represented more in government is silly.
Have you seen the SNL Dunkin Donuts skit? That shit cracks me up.
Dunkin is a hell of a lot better than Starbucks, but that's not saying a whole lot.
I love how usually there's warm feelings for Bernie here, but go to S4P and so many comments are trashing Warren...   Despite being a heavy Bernie supporter, with a lean towards Warren this election, I just can't do S4P, man... the gentler, often more wholesome, discussion here or in Buttigieg's sub just feels a whole lot better.
He's got his 2016 foundations to build from though, massive head start.
He really has done some amazing things, but he's not liked by the powerful on both sides. His lack of press for commonly polling as the 2nd place candidate with such a progressive platform is at best bizarre, and most likely deliberate.
Well there are many that can't or won't push as hard because they depend on dialing for big money donors.
Irony is strong with you...
She's not doing that.   But Muslims have concerns for their safety, discrimination, and their freedom to worship.
[deleted]
I don't really drink much coffee, but I hate their donuts. Philly has so many great donut places that it's hard to eat chain donuts now. Then again, it's not fair to compare local chains to more national/large regional ones.
I feel you. I flirted with supporting Sanders after seeing Warren not do so well initially, but when she picked up steam I felt like I could support a winning candidate that I still loved. Sanders is really respectful in general of his opponents. His surrogates, though... not so much. And unfortunately the attitude of his surrogates affects that of many of his followers, which is a shame because they strongly believe in so many good things.
I have actually seen quite a few positive comments about Warren on S4P, but there are a small minority that are basically like "take her down, she's the enemy, Hillary 2.0" etc, which is upsetting and I think not going to help them get more votes.   I do like the positive vibe here, goes along with Warren's positive vision for the future that we are all fighting for!
That should make it even easier for him to reach out to these gatherings and grow his support.
Sorry I don't understand.
Fight for equal protections under the law, but we already have too much religious influence in our government.
[removed]
Yeah, I was just talking about the coffee. I don't really eat donuts much but I'm a goddamn coffee fiend.
Oh not saying he shouldn't, just that I understand it's still very early days in the contest. You'll still be doing this this time next year, he can wait, his position is established, Warren has more work to do, so thats why you see her pushing so hard. I'm glad she is, she's really good. I hope you guys end up with her or Bernie, both good options. (Will see what I think of the others as this goes on)
Agree but I see Warren going to this event as something positive.
*Christian influence. I don‚Äôt want any religion in government either, but don‚Äôt pretend like Islam isn‚Äôt a minority with very little power.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I'm not pretending that. Keep all religion out of my government.
Ah, I was ignorant of "!=" meaning until just now, my bad.
Great argument. I didn't call black people tokens, I called Carson one. Do you honestly think he's anything but a tool for the GOP? He's an example of "one of the good ones" and frequently used to discredit the plight of African-Americans who didn't pick themselves up by the bootstraps like Ben did.

Warren: Kavanaugh 'should be impeached' just like Trump
And she's right and even though Senate won't it's important for her to make it clear where she stands on the issue.
They need to give him the full Abe Fortas treatment: investigate his ethics problems until he resigns or is utterly humiliated.   It‚Äôs not just the sexual assaults, it‚Äôs the money. He said he had hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt from buying Nationals tickets? Everything about him stinks to high heaven, and it would be a mistake *not* to investigate the hell out of him.
Hopefully, Warren will not let Trump/Kavanaugh get away with any crimes if she is in office.   Too many times, we have let Republicans get away with crimes so as to ‚Äúnot tear apart the country‚Äù while the Republicans continue to irreversibly tear apart the country.
Let‚Äôs throw in Gorsuch, too.
While I agree with Warren that the filibuster is very bad for voting on legislation, it's still good for nominations. Special K would never have made it to the bench if they needed 60 votes. Moscow Mitch has fucked us for the next 30 years. I just hope we can replace RBG within the next 4 years. I don't know how long she has.
keeping that same energy
At this point I don't even care if there is evidence or not, Kavanaugh needs to be impeached. And Trump should go to jail on bigotry charges
Yeahhhh idk about this one guys
Just so we are all on message and clear: the Senate does not impeach. It hears the trial and may vote to convict and remove after the House votes to impeach
Yes. I think we're all watching too see who will do anything. Not afraid to shake up the status quo. I like Warren. Just need to see if she'll back up what she says. ü§î
Is she still right considering that the victim can‚Äôt verify that it happened and never filed a complaint?  I mean, she‚Äôs a lawyer.  So surely she understands due process and rules of evidence?
His debts were all mysteriously paid off.  And then there was Kennedy‚Äôs sudden retirement and his son‚Äôs connection to Deutsche Bank and Trump‚Äôs loans.
Can you source the nationals tickets thing? Never heard that
>They need to give him the full Abe Fortas treatment: investigate his ethics problems until he resigns or is utterly humiliated.  I don't know. Nothing about this guy makes me think he has enough of a sense of shame to see himself out. And the whole landscape is so tribalistic now that he'll have unconditional support from Republicans who will just say he's being railroaded, so it might not even really work at humiliating him if they manage to convince everyone that these are partisan smears and "liable."
This is exactly why the filibuster is bad. It's useless. It's just ignored when it matters. Getting rid of it will help the Democrats be on the same playing field, and it may encourage discussion about a better procedure.
>Special K would never have made it to the bench if they needed 60 votes.  But Merrick Garland would have if they hadn't. . .
Yeah I agree with you. It sucks that Kavanaugh is on the court, but I don't think trying to impeach him (and probably failing) would accomplish anything other than contributing to the ongoing political polarization of the Supreme Court.  I don't want the judicial branch to be destroyed by the same toxic partisanship that has paralyzed the legislature.
That's true.  Clarification is necessary because some people don't understand the process.  "Even though the Senate won't convict and remove Kavanaugh" would have been a more precise way for me to phrase it.
Impeachment simply means that we become able to level charges against someone - not necessarily convict them of a crime.
Facts? Evidence? Get out of here with your Republican talking points.
Here ya go: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/new-strike-against-kavanaugh-season-tickets/565022/
He may not leave the court, but I think he definitely feels shame. Think about how bombastic he was at the confirmation hearings‚Äîit definitely bothers him. Right-wingers will defend him because‚Ä¶ well, you know. But we should at least get the satisfaction of ruining his name.
I agree.  I'm a big advocate FOR the filibuster--but you're right.  It only works if everyone abides its conventions and tradition.  Even then, people will disagree with it as a tool (even if I think it is a good one). If anyone doesn't?  It stops working entirely.  It isn't worth keeping once the crack forms.  We've reached that point.  Ditch it.  And if we want comity and deliberation in the Senate?  We can damn well pass laws and amendments to do so such that one side can't unilaterally abuse the system while the other side can't.
I think that ship has already set sail due to Moscow Mitch's actions in 2016.
Perfect.
I think the filibuster has it's place *if* it's old school style. It has to be an issue that you care enough about to stand on the senate floor and ramble for 72 hours and withstand public pressure to do their jobs. Where we get into trouble is these stupid cloture votes where we allow a party to just say "I intend to filibuster". It allows them to do that to everything.
Warren will just purge the FBI of wingnuts and have them arrest Kavanaugh.  AND remove the filibuster.
I think she's unlikely to "purge" the FBI.  Or have Kavanaugh arrested--that's bizarre.  But remove the filibuster?  I think she'd push for that openly.

Elizabeth Warren just called Donald Trump ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Elf on a Shelf‚Äù
I don‚Äôt miss Jeff Sessions, but I do miss Kate McKinnon‚Äôs sketches w/ him on SNL where she played him as an odd little southern racist elf creature and this made me think of that.
I honestly have never felt so fucked in my life as I do the last few weeks.
This is unapologetically amazing.
You've heard of elf on a shelf, now get ready for  Rootin' Tootin' Gay-Prosecutin' Journalist-Shootin' Putin
Whether he realizes it or not, Trump is helping Putin terraform Siberia. Why else would he roll back methane leak standards, which even gas companies support? Expect talks of selling Alaska back to Russia to pay off the national debt. We are all caught in a nasty game of geopolitics as a few billionaires struggle over the 21st century‚Äôs arable land while letting the rest of us burn, drown, starve, and suffocate.   [I even made a game out of it.](https://igg.me/at/gop)
I've been saying it for a long time.  The GOP now stands for Government Of PUTIN!!!
Lol I love it
I hate living in this timeline of history. This is a great clap back moment for her because it's absolutely true. Now Putin's Elf is openly speaking about Giuliani's involvement in the Ukraine plot.  r/murderbywords
It‚Äôs the other way around: Putin is the Elf on Trump‚Äôs Shelf watching and scaring him into behaving.
I think warren is the least damaged candidate in the race with the best chance to beat him, but I don‚Äôt think this is a very clever insult.
Love it!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Honestly, I like Warren for her substance, not for snappy one liners. Too much of politics is a game of who has the cleverest burn these days. Give me a position paper and a plan, not a Twitter burn!
Putin‚Äôs Elf on a Shelf. Leave it to Liz haha
GOTEM!!

As much as Putin wants Siberia terraformed, he wants the Arctic ice to melt so Russia can access the sweet sweet gas deposits buried underneath the Arctic Ocean even more.  And seriously, it's screamingly obvious that the entire democratic world is under systematic attack by Russian-backed fascists -- and yet so many people don't even realize it. It's so frustrating.
Wow that‚Äôs awesome
That feeling when you know she's the best candidate for the job but you worry she might get outmaneuvered when it comes to the Twitter industrial complex.
Why not?  The Elf is a spy for Santa placed there by unknown forces.  I mean...
why not tho, I think it's hilarious.
I agree, I support Warren for her well thought out plans and hate that out politics have degraded to memes and one-liners.  With that said....Warren does have some sick burns.
Removed per Rule 11.
[removed]
Read the Mueller Report.
I take it you never read the Muller report?  I did. I also read the Call Summary where Trump asked a foreign country to interfere with domestic elections.  I also watched as he did it again, and again, on interviews.   He has been pretty blatant about it, and people mistake breaking the law in the open as not a crime. It just means he is a shitty criminal.
Actually what they found was collusion and obstruction of justice.  But Muller, a life long Republican, also pointed out that a sitting president can‚Äôt be indicted.  Which you would know if you read the report.  And we know that Moscow Mitch and his merry band of sycophants won‚Äôt hold the president to account in any other way.  Which you would know if you were awake last week.     I just can‚Äôt wait for January 20th, 2020 at about 12:01 pm when Elizabeth says ‚Äú...so help me god.‚Äù And off camera we hear a federal marshal say ‚Äúplease place your hands behind your back mr. president.‚Äù <click> <click>.  But that won‚Äôt happen because on January 20th, Chump is going to be in his Dacha in Armenia.
Middle class will be brought back by cancelling Trump's tax cuts for the rich, which even Buttigieg is going to do, let alone Warren or Sanders.
What will she do to help minorities and the middle class, you ask? here the answer: https://elizabethwarren.com/plans
Exactly
The problem is the analogy is flipped unless the tweeter was misquoting Warren. Trump being Putin‚Äôs ‚ÄúElf‚Äù means Trump is spying on Putin.
The elf is there to give a detailed account. Trump isn‚Äôt that for Putin. The elf is not there to wreck the house, trump is that for Putin. Also it‚Äôs a super dated meme. In early November of 2018 it would have been a great thing to say about Jeff Sessions re: Trump.
You know how people always list ‚Äúsense of humor‚Äù as an attractive quality? Well that‚Äôs only half of it. The other half is that you laugh at the jokes someone you are attracted to makes. Liking warren makes her seem funnier than she actually is. But you laughing doesn‚Äôt make it funny to people she needs to win over.   Just as a meme it‚Äôs way out of date which isn‚Äôt a good look. Then as an analogy it doesn‚Äôt fit, trump is a hand grenade that Putin threw in to DC. He‚Äôs not silently gliding around the country looking for things to report back. The funniest thing about it is that it rhymes.

I was so impressed by one of her lectures over a decade ago that I shared it around. Finally it felt like there was someone who understood what was happening to the middle and working classes in the country. I want that person holding the levers of power. The rational, methodical, smart and insightful advocate for working people.   It's absolutely *maddening* her core message has to be filtered through the child's sand pit that is social media and the 24 hr news cycle.
Nah it means Trump is spying for Putin.
I disagree. Trump has a habit of making inexplicable decisions that just so happen to play directly into Putin's hands, or making bizzare (even by Trump standards) claims that just so happen to line up with the Kremlin's latest round of talking points.   There's clearly some kind of communication going on between the Kremlin and the White House. I wouldn't be surprised if it was two-way.
okay. i'm struck by how seriously you seem to take this but i'll accept that logic for why you don't think it's clever.   Did you watch the video? It's actually not clear if she was calling trump or putin the elf on the shelf. And she literally only said the words "elf on a shelf" briefly in response to someone else who set the context. It wasn't like...a thought through thing.

Removed for Rule 7.  Do not spread false or misleading information.  Warren has in fact not missed more votes than other senators.  Of the Senators who have been running, [only Klob and Bennet missed fewer](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/15/senate-voting-records-070916).

It' no small wonder we got a swamp creature like Trump that way. People are having fun so they think they must be doing the right thing, which is exactly how a drunk on their 12th shot approaches things. I want the adults to be in charge again.
Link?
Is that what the elf on a shelf is supposed to do? Change your house for Santa's benefit? There is two way communication going on, but it's not every little detail constantly. You've just got to really push the comparison for the joke, at which point it's not a really clever joke.
Didn‚Äôt watch the video, only read the tweet. If it‚Äôs way better in context then it‚Äôs probably comedic timing, in which case the video is what should be pushed around and any attempt to push a retelling should be resisted. Comedic timing is something great and something to be proud of, Jerry Seinfeld made a huge career out of telling mediocre jokes with amazing timing. If someone retells you one of your favorite Seinfeld lines you remember the joke in context and laughter at your memory of Jerry‚Äôs great timing; if you tell the same joke to a person who has never watched Seinfeld they aren‚Äôt likely to have a good impression of Seinfeld.
[removed]
Removed for Rule 7 (Do not spread false or misleading information).  Please refer to Warren's [student debt cancellation plan](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/student-loan-debt-day-one), the first one introduced in the campaign.  Sanders was following her lead.  This is a warning.  Do not come to /r/ElizabethWarren and spread misinformation about her plans and policies.  If you don't know her platform well enough to know one of her often mentioned and extremely popular plans, don't comment as if you do.
And I don't *want* that adult to be good at being a Twitter troll either.. But Dammit. Know The Swamp.
She has several but I'm pretty sure [it was this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A)  No matter what you see on the campaign trail, this is the mind that could be in the whitehouse. Inquisitive, immensely knowledgeable and concerned with working people many, *many* years before she was a politician.  I know everyone has their pet issue but Jesus, she has a message with mass appeal and the mind and insight to implement it. I honestly don't watch the news and the daily horserace for the kind of stuff in the tweet this thread is about. And honestly, not all of my views align with some of the ones I see expressed here. I just know what she was concerned about before she became a politician so I trust that no matter what, this is the person you get.

Warren rising in Iowa, most favorably viewed candidate in field with 78% favorability
Dare I say she is right where she wants to be. Let Biden and Bernie take the arrows for awhile.
That's great news. People love the up and coming candidate. More and more will support Warren as they see others doing the same.   And fortunately, there is a long time to jump ship from inferior candidates who appeal to others only in terms of the nebulous notion of "electability."
I think she may resonate with Republican voters because they're poorer and her message is not your fault, the system is rigged and let's fix it.
I've never donated to a presidential candidate.    Since she is not taking big money I am donating this year.
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   Caucus: February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
I don't want to get hurt again, so I'm trying to temper my excitement. But I've still been sure to talk to everyone in my social circle about her. Feels less like a pipedream than it did a month ago, that's for sure.
I would love to see her go the distance and give Biden a run for his money. Best case scenario is if Bernie continues to struggle and comes in 3rd his supporters would naturally be picked up by Warren.
Go Liz! I just got my Persist sticker in the mail today. Rooting hard!
Keep it up warren!
Notice how in the chart she's the only candidate referred to by only her first name? All the other candidates have both their first and last name.
Why isn‚Äôt her picture in this article. More male coverage. So blatant bias. Typical media.
Exactly! A slow rise is a safe rise, and I think it is more authentic this way. I'd imagine a slower rise represents a candidate who is going out and talking to people face-to-face to reach them as opposed to letting the media broadcast your face 24/7. Getting too much attention too quickly can be a bad thing. Beto is a good example.
Agreed--and shes got this personal touch that gets missed at big rallies but if you meet her in person as I have (shes my senator) shes sweet, kind, and listens. To me shes an old school progressive like from the 1890s. Definitely excited about her running and happy to vote for her.
And she has the unique claim that she was a republican for a large stretch of her adult life, which is something that could bring comfort to centrist Republican voters.
https://i.imgur.com/6hCQomf.gifv
I think the primary will eventually boil down to Warren vs Biden. It's very likely that Bernies campaign drags (its already dropping) and he bows out and endorses Warren.
Elizabeth ‚ÄúTeddy Roosevelt‚Äù Warren
Bernie has the cash to stay to the bitter end if he so chooses.
Not really. He has $30 million cash on hand. That might keep him in the race till Super Tuesday.   In 2016 he got slaughtered by Hillary on Super Tuesday. It‚Äôs not looking good for him.
Not looking good? Bernie has more unique donors than any other candidate *by far*. His funding is solid. The people in real funding trouble are all the ones trying to chase big donors. With so many people in the race, those donors are only going to max out for a few, if that. And then they have to find new people.  That's the beauty of getting your funding from regular everyday people. Hardly any of them max out, and certainly not in the beginning. If you get enough real people supporting you, you can go the distance.  I like Warren. Not as much as Bernie, but shes in my top 3. Its cool if you like Warren the best. But trying to talk down Sanders in a non-factual manner isn't how you get to the top with progressives, IMO.
The X Factor is that if people start seeing Warren rise and she siphons support from Sanders, his revenue could easily dry up.  Having the most unique small donors is a great strategy if you can keep them all.  But if other candidates start looking more viable or offer more appealing solutions to people, you‚Äôre going to start to lose them.  I think a lot of people dove in on Bernie because he had the name recognition and they honestly hadn‚Äôt looked into the other candidates.  If he can keep those donors with him he will be fine.  If they start to taper off Bernie could find himself in trouble.
There's certainly some cross appeal between Bernie and Warren, and vice versa. But I think Bernie has a decent size of core supporters that aren't going anywhere. So, while it's possible that he could lose some, I doubt his funding will "dry up". As far as being viable, Bernie is still solidly in the top 2 slots. So, that concern seems premature.  Still a long way to go. We'll see what happens. But my sense is that Warren's new supporters are mostly people who are more party loyalists. People who shopped around between Kamala, Pete, etc. and are now gravitating towards Warren. I hope that's what's going on. I don't really want to see Warren and Sanders cannibalize each other's supporters. The more people supporting progressives, the better, IMO.
This primary isn‚Äôt over. Full house at The Filmore in Denver, CO for Liz
How does Warren draw such crowds, and be outpolled by Pete? His events are consistently nowhere near this size.
I‚Äôve seen several photos and videos of the crowd size in Denver and they‚Äôve all made me so happy. There IS momentum!! Let‚Äôs keep this fight going!
I was there! It was a pretty incredible experience. The line stretched back four blocks at one point. One of the question-askers said he was at the Pete event last night and Warren's blew his out of the water on the enthusiasm front. I was debating making the drive but am so glad I did.
Ugh I wanted to go to this so badly but chose to canvass yesterday instead and didn't have time today; really hoping I made a difference with the undecided voters I chatted with (everyone at least had Liz in their top two!!).
There's a [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfUM0IA7mTs) as well.
nice! that is a great venue.
I‚Äôm a Bernie/Liz voter, I‚Äôll vote for the progressive candidate who has the best chance to win the nomination.  Today‚Äôs national polling showing Warren and Bernie as the top two candidates is a dream come true for me and I hope that is the way the race stays.   Imagine the establishment heads exploding when it becomes clear that the choice is between which flavor of fundamental change the party puts forward.  It‚Äôs a great time to be a progressive in America as we are finally getting our say.
I‚Äôve watched a lot of her rallies and this was a particularly good one. She‚Äôs drawing big crowds, her fighting spirit is up, she‚Äôs consistently sticking to her values (got a question today from an undecided about M4A vs public option and she framed it in terms of us needing to fight to get insurance for every person, not wait around because we think it‚Äôs too difficult), and she‚Äôs leaning into her coalition building skills (CFPB) as an argument for her effectiveness.
but two tiny states and a desert have voted!!! it's all over!!!  /s
It‚Äôs not over! Nevertheless, she persisted!  Honestly, regardless of the outcomes Tuesday, I hope Warren continues to persist in her run for the White House.  I think that she is many people‚Äôs first choice in their hearts, but they are scared and giving their votes (right now) to lesser candidates out of a desire to not lose to Trump. If there are a series of candidates who drop out, I really like a Warren vs Sanders two horse race, and think she does well even if only 1-3 other candidates drop out (looking at you, Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden!).  In that scenario, I think that - even with Mayor Pete still in the race - a lot of folks who are concerned, as I am, that Sanders will struggle to reach out to even more moderate Dems, let alone Republicans, would flock to Warren.   Keep going, Senator! We love and are inspired by what you‚Äôre doing!
She's struggling, it's a shame people don't see what we see in her but even if she's not winning these early states she's still losing them by far too much.  I'm with her until the end, but at this point my support is more so she can hopefully get a cabinet position or even VP spot than any confidence she will be the nominee.  She's by far the best candidate and it frustrates me tremendously the rest of the country doesn't see that.
I was there! Great crowd, great energy!
I really wish she would have expanded on her thinking with that last question on the contested convention. The I couldn't remember how it worked thing kinda feels like a cop out. Still though, really enjoyed watching the rally from my former home state. Glad they gave her a proper welcome with a full house!

I have to wonder if this will actually help us.

Pete appeals to old people, oddly enough. They are probably staying in because it's late and cold outside, and standing for long periods is uncomfortable for them.
People nerdy enough to attend a political rally during a primary are not representative of the public at large.  Same goes for putting up yard signs, sticking bumper stickers, posting on Twitter or /r/politics, etc.  They're good signs of enthusiasm, but enthusiasm is what makes marginal people show up on voting day and bring their friends. The big bulk of voters are just habitual and don't actually care that much.
It's honestly so impressive. She's on the rise and it makes me so excited because she's the kind of trans-formative president that we need
I heard that and noted it
You sacrificed yourself for the team. I am definitely impressed and grateful to you.
Fighting the good fight!
I just watched it! Wow! I really want to go to a rally now.
Yeah I was watching that!! I felt super energized by it!!
Thanks for posting! Really enjoyed it
Man that little video blurb before the rally she needs to blast that all over the tv airwaves
Thanks so much for linking this. I don't know why but it seems like it's hard to find her rallies but links to Buttigieg's pop up so easily.
>  I‚Äôll vote for the progressive candidate who has the best chance to win the nomination.  The progressive candidate with the best chance to win the nomination? When do you vote?
Holy fuck, I hadn't seen those polls yet. That's very encouraging!
What polls are you looking at that show that?
Don't give up! I've been text banking and have spoken to thousands of people in the Super Tuesday states. There is a LOT of enthusiasm for her.
If she's not the nominee I doubt she'll leave the Senate until her term is up, she wouldn't want to give the GOP governor a seat to fill.  As much as I'd like to see her in the Exec branch she's very effective as a Senator and is one of the best people to have when dealing with the financial industry.  Still, I think super tuesday is when we'll really see. There are thousands of delegates left, I don't consider this struggling at all.
Big changes in history never came easy. People dug in their heels and fought back harder.
It's not over yet
There‚Äôs so much that can still happen. This moment, with Trump in office and Bernie‚Äôs rise, is so unprecedented and unpredictable.
It's way too early for talk of a brokered convention and MSNBC was reckless in broaching the topic after only two states.
Removed rule 11.
Compensating for something?
[removed]
I'm so happy to see support growing
[removed]
Felt electric even just watching on the stream! And despite having seen a lot of these by now, it still fills my heart with hope and optimism every time.
CBS News/YouGov national preference poll released yesterday
That's very true and a very pragmatic way to look at it, not surprising considering our base and candidate :)
It was basically a gotcha question for Bernie.   Of course there‚Äôs cases where a brokered convention makes sense; I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely, but if Bernie had a plurality but also had incapacitating heart failure right before the convention he might want to throw his support behind Liz instead of letting the DNC pick.  But that‚Äôs unlikely, and a silly thing for him to say as a front runner
Maybe. I think it's probably a coalition of older more religious people who think Biden is past his sell-by date, but I could be mistaken.
honest question, shouldn't the VP ideally be someone who's black if the nominee is white?
Senate majority leader if Sanders wins it.
Elizabeth Warren Is Making All the Right Enemies | Mark Zuckerberg says a Warren presidency could ‚Äúsuck‚Äù for Facebook. Seems like good news for the rest of us
A quote from Franklin Delano Roosevelt:   >We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace--business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.  >They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.  >Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me--and I welcome their hatred.
A Warren presidency would "Zuck" for a lot of those greedy mutherf'ers. Wouldn't suck for the rest of us.
This headline is misleading. What he actually says is that it would ‚Äúsuck‚Äù for Facebook to have to file suit against the US government in order to prevent a break up, he also says he‚Äôs confident Facebook would win that suit.
I‚Äôm an Amazon (AWS) tech worker, and staunch Warren supporter, and I love her stance on breaking up big tech. She uses all the right words. Some progressives want to punish big tech, which is not the right way to look at it. Big tech needs to be broken up to push competition, but shouldn‚Äôt be punished for succeeding in an under-regulated market.
That's an endorsement!
But the virulent Bernie supporters still call Warren a "corporate stooge"
She oughta make an ad with this quote spliced with all these quotes from Wall Street executives, Zuckerberg, etc. expressing fear and hate for her. Make it backfire on them.
Yes! She quoted that in "This Fight is Our Fight."
True, but he was saying that a Warren presidency (A) would equal a lawsuit against the US government (B) which would = suck for Facebook (C).
Elizabeth Warren is now among Democratic front runners
[Here](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2019-05-28/six-democrat-variables-01-01-01-01.png) is an image of the results.   She's continuing to gain ground as she puts out more impressive policies that will help the vast majority of Americans.   Hopefully more of the working class folks hear about her policies and history protecting the common man from corporate crimes.
IMO I don‚Äôt think the fallout from bernie supporters would be as bad as what happened to HRC.  Many Bernie supporters are also fans of Warren and they both worked on important legislation together.  Me included, if warren dropped out, I‚Äôd switch to Bernie in a heartbeat, Biden not so much.
I just cannot fathom how Biden is getting support. Literally no one I know from three separate states of living has said anything supportive about him.
Right where she should be!
Good.
Awesome üëè
Wow, she's doing a lot better than I thought! She's virtually tied with Sanders (who I thought would have had a bigger lead). I just wish Biden wasn't getting so much media coverage.
She needs to really campaign and reach out to the black community. Imo, she has the best platform here.
Not long before she is #1 sorry Joe
"Warren leads among liberals while Sanders leads among men" says a lot.
Remember folks, we're in the great game now. At some point soon the social media battle will begin in earnest, you tweet something positive and you get back 30 angry troll tweets. They're bots. Report them and move on, do not feel intimidated, do not be silenced. People you know will post stupid unsourced "news" on facebook. Call out the false propaganda and report it to facebook so at the very least, there's a record of a report, and they might even reduce it's circulation.
We are going to have trouble with the Bernie and Biden crowd. Over 20% each are only considering Biden and Bernie. Gonna be another shitshow.
Great! The more traction she gets the better. But I would start looking for more and more disingenuous attacks from the politico and MSNBC set as she becomes more viable and more of a threat to win.
We can‚Äôt have another 2016. Please get behind who gets the DNC nomination. I know it might not be who you want but it‚Äôs an important step to take back our government
Bernie needs to drop out.  A primary between Biden and Warren contrasting 3rd way incrementalism and radical (for the US) progressive *policy* is exactly what the democratic party needs.
>She's continuing to gain ground as she puts out more impressive policies that will help the vast majority of Americans.  More importantly, it seems like one of the impediments to her doing even better is just the perception that she's not doing well.  *Many are also unsure whether Warren can win the Democratic nomination and the election. Democrats themselves are somewhat optimistic, although less than half currently think she is likely to win the nomination or win the general election.*  This suggests she's positioned to spike really quickly once the dam breaks.
I suspect what you have said is right but I think the big boost she is seeing now is from her unabashed stance on impeaching Trump.   Many of us are tired of this political prognostication about the implications of impeaching when our representatives are tasked with defending the constitution and country from a criminal in the whitehouse, whether or not it will help them politically, as Warren has done by being the first to come out in favor of moving forward with impeachment.
Right? I was a huge Bernie supporter last cycle, but this one Warren actually got me to donate to her campaign thanks to her policy push.
Right? A lot of the bitter ex-hillary supporters up in this thread don't understand the difference between not liking a candidate because she's a corporatist conservative masquerading as a progressive, and not liking her because 'she's a woman' and 'your toxic lol.' They seem to think that current Sanders and Warren supporters are somehow against each other. They aren't.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  That or they are Russian bot accounts designed to foment hatred among us.
He stood next to a successful black guy for awhile.
It could be the company you surround yourself with.  The more moderate democrats, particularly those that lean to the left on social issues and to the right on fiscal issues are strongly opposed to the "progressives".   If you're living paycheck to paycheck, I'd imagine you're much less keen on Biden than someone who's more comfortable.
Name recognition and Obama branding.
*For the love of god, people, stop freaking out about this!!!*  The first debate is still a month away, the primary really hasn‚Äôt even begun yet! If this was a sports league, we‚Äôd still be in the preseason right now. A very small section of the electorate is paying attention right now, it‚Äôs only political junkies like us who are following this stuff daily. And have we failed to consider who the two front runners are? Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.   Okay, that‚Äôs *Joe Biden* - as in, the former VP to Barack Obama, the most popular and well liked president alive, and arguably one of the best president‚Äôs this country has ever had (historians rank him around #12).   And *Bernie Sanders* - as in, the candidate whose historic primary campaign nearly unseated Hillary Clinton in 2016 and who built a following that is unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on left on the left in our lifetime.   *Of course* those are the two front runners at this stage of the primary. Like I said, most people aren‚Äôt paying attention right now, and the debates haven‚Äôt begun so most voters don‚Äôt know who their options even are. Biden and Sanders are leading because those are the names that people recognize.   But mark my words, Biden‚Äôs support will migrate elsewhere once people begin to tune in and learn who the real Joe Biden is, apart from the goofy lovable VP to the president everyone has fond memories of.
Older people and black people love him
I understand why the corporate media loves him, he's a classic puppet politician who will do everything they can to help the rich at the expense of the rest of us.  Why real Americans support him? Ignorance and complacency are my best guess.
There exist moderates.  They're likely going heavily for Biden.
Nostalgia. I'm skeptical of this round robin debate stuff, I want Warren unleashed on him.
Same way that Trump was able to waltz into the election last year, name recognition. That's one of the big powers of money, it allows you to blast your name all over the place. It helps that Donald understands how to create drama. By doing so he is able to get media outlets to publish him since what he says will get people to click.
Same. No one I know ia going for him
You have to think of it in simpler terms. Everyone agrees the position that most prepares you to be president is vicepresident. He was vicepresident for 8 years for a presidency that was very popular, particularly among Democrats. We can argue to what extent it was things he did vs things everyone else in the admin did vs what Obama himself did vs other factors. But the average voter thinks of things more broadly and less ideologically.
This poll is "considering voting for" though. At first I thought people were talking about a tie in the horserace poll. It's a good sign but clearly Warren is still behind in the regular polling. Surging, though, it seems.
I heard something really interesting this morning while listening to talk radio. I don‚Äôt remember the exact % results in each poll, but this was the gist:  - In 2016, most of Bernie‚Äôs support came from people who self-identified as ‚Äúpaying extremely close attention‚Äù to the primary.   - Currently, most of Bernie‚Äôs support is coming from people who are ‚Äúnot paying attention‚Äù - indicating that the base of support he formed in 2016 is still there, and they aren‚Äôt bothering to pay attention because they aren‚Äôt shopping around. They know who they are going to support, and they don‚Äôt need to know anything more than that.   - Currently, the candidate doing the best with voters who are ‚Äúpaying extremely close attention‚Äù is Liz Warren.  This suggests to me that Bernie‚Äôs support base is something of a fan club, and it‚Äôs pretty solidified. It‚Äôs not going to drop much, but neither will it increase much - because the thing that brought people into Bernie‚Äôs camp in 2016 are now leading people to Warren for the 2020 primary.
It's actually a bit surprising. I would have expected Biden to lead men just like he does for women.
She's second behind Bernie who is number one, with a 7 point spread while Biden is number 3.  Among females, Biden is number one with 51%, Warren in second, and Bernie 4th or ties with Harris.   So is what it tells you that democratic men are more progressive than women? What's your point?
It's Biden vs everyone else right now. Biden has the more conservative voters. In order for a progressive to win either Warren needs to convince Bernie to drop out early, Bernie needs to convince Warren to drop out early, or Biden needs to make major early missteps. I'm hoping that Bernie and Warren have personally discussed the possibility of one of them dropping out early with each other.
I think it's (way) too early to say what voters we're going to have trouble with. The field could collapse into two major candidates as two wings of the party each coalesce behind a single candidate before super Tuesday, or the field could still be wide open and we might be looking at a run-off for the final election.   In the former situation I think there's a good chance that current Biden Voters will be the biggest opposition, in the latter it could be Bernie or honestly anyone because it's a Wildcard's Game at that point.  And honestly, if we get to a point where it's a matter of Bernie versus Liz, I'm fucking happy no matter who wins.
We only really need to worry about Biden supporters. They're older and more conservative so more likely to vote Trump than not at all.  I understand Bernie supporters who aren't bothering to look at other candidates because he's got decades of consistency and actually polling at the top of a very crowded field. If push came to shove, I seriously doubt that they would vote for Trump over a progressive like Warren or a moderate Democrat. They held their nose & voted for Clinton at a higher rate than her supporters did for Obama in 08.
Absolutely! Corporate media will cut down any progressive that threatens their owners' bottom lines. I like using fair.org as a media watchdog personally.
It's waaaay too early for Bernie to pass the Baton. Until Iowa it's strictly better for Progressives to have more voices in the race and in the debates.
> I suspect what you have said is right but I think the big boost she is seeing now is from her unabashed stance on impeaching Trump.  This poll is May 18th to the 21st. I don't think that would have made a big enough dent back then. It suddenly has a lot more salience now though, so we'll see how it works out for her.
Yeah, donating and supporting both right now. My state is so late in the primary process I probably won't have to choose, and if they are both their to the end that's a great choice to make.
I agree with most of what you said but I remember seeing a poll stating that among Warren supporters, Bernie was the second choice but among Bernie supporters Biden was the second choice. Seeing as Bernie and Biden are practically polar opposites, I would argue that there is some sexism at play and that shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed. Also I‚Äôve noticed some of my favorite political commentators (Michael Brooks for example) misrepresent and attack Warren.
Yup, I'm sick of people freaking the fuck out about polls   Just spread the word about Warren (or whatever candidates you want), remain diligent, and go vote in the primaries. Quit the fearmongering/defeatist negativity and work toward something positive.
You really think Biden‚Äôs goal in supporting the Democratic Party for the last 50 years has been to help the rich at the expense of everyone else?   The ‚Äúcorporate media‚Äù loves to cover him because he‚Äôs twice as popular as any of the other candidates because he has strong support from older voters and black voters. He‚Äôs hardly some puppet. He‚Äôs a very popular former Democratic VP.  He has plenty of shortcomings as a candidate, but don‚Äôt spread this toxic attitude. A Biden presidency would be 1000x better than any Republican and a big step forward, even if it‚Äôs not as good as what we want.
Your viewpoints on him are a bit toxic, I must say
What makes you think that about him? He‚Äôs not exactly a wealthy man himself.
If it's all about name recognition Biden would be tied with Sanders.
Is there any way we can get the media to black out coverage of trump except for actual policy coverage?  No more free airtime for the criminal.  They have him billions in free airtime last time around.
> Everyone agrees the position that most prepares you to be president is vicepresident.  Who agrees to this? I'd argue governor of a large, diverse state like New York or California would be way more useful.
I was merely noting what I found so distasteful in the last election -- how Sanders' popularity seemed driven by the primacy of Bernie Bros. They made my local caucus a nightmare, they way they bullied HRC voters.
I'm afraid the long he stays in the greater the "Potomac fever" he'll get (again).  His justification for running, rightly so, was the lack of progressive voice.  Bluntly, that's not the case in 2020.
She first came out for impeachment on the 7th of may IIRC, why would a three week gap between then and the poll not be enough to see a sway?
>You really think Biden‚Äôs goal in supporting the Democratic Party for the last 50 years has been to help the rich at the expense of everyone else?   Whether that was his goal, it's what he's accomplished. Look at how corporate friendly he made his home state.  >The ‚Äúcorporate media‚Äù loves to cover him because he‚Äôs twice as popular as any of the other candidates because he has strong support from older voters and black voters. He‚Äôs hardly some puppet. He‚Äôs a very popular former Democratic VP.  He has twice the name recognition of any other candidate. You're right about his support among older voters, but I'd have to see polling that he's really popular with black voters. Obama picked him to get white voters to vote for Obama, not to get black voters to support him.   >He has plenty of shortcomings as a candidate, but don‚Äôt spread this toxic attitude. A Biden presidency would be 1000x better than any Republican and a big step forward, even if it‚Äôs not as good as what we want.  Honestly, while it will be a nicer presidency, I doubt it would be much better than a Republican presidency if his interviews, policies, and history in the Obama administration is any indication. He'll talk a good game while letting Republicans play a good game.   That said, yeah I'm going to vote for him over a Republican, but we can't let that low bar be the standard. Republicans will keep limboing under it while Democrats hurdle just barely ever it instead of pole vaulting over them.
This! 100x times this! We must not become like the Bernie bros and their toxic support of their candidate. Let's try to be positive and welcoming while still debating important ideas and principles
Maybe. Personally, I find his views & continued support for the awful Crime Bill he put together incredibly toxic.
[Just one source for you](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/18/joe-biden-2020-money-wealth-1221934)  "‚ÄúMiddle-Class Joe‚Äù Biden has a $2.7 million vacation home." "He charges more than $100,000 per speaking gig and has inked a book deal likely worth seven figures." (I checked and the book deal is worth $8 million dollars) I dont have a problem with people becoming wealthy, but you said he wasn't exactly a wealthy man himself, which is untrue. He likes to call himself "middle-class Joe" but that is no longer true, if it once was.   Some of his prior stances and actions rub me the wrong way.  He supported bankruptcy reform which made it almost impossible to discharge student loans. Since then he has backed several bills that make it harder for average Americans to declare bankruptcy in attempts to appease the credit card companies that are from his homestate of Delaware.  He has terrible history in terms of racial issues as well, being an "anti-bussing crusader" in the 70's and being for the 1994 crime bill which led to a rapid increase in the prison population.  He believes "life begins at the moment of conception" and has a bad history on pro-choice legislation, usually choosing to abstain from voting.  His role in the confirmation of Clarence Thomas even with the allegations against him remind me so much of Susanne Collins and Kavanaugh it looks bad.  Voted FOR the Iraq war. I don't feel I need to elaborate on why that was dumb.  The smallest issue I have with him is his age. He is 76, Trump is 72. Why nominate someone who will turn what would be one more Trump weakness, into a strength?   He is a terrrible candidate for the Democratic party, especially in 2020. We need someone younger to provide an even better foil to the travesty that is in the White House right now, and Warren fits that bill.
As for his wealth:  https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/18/joe-biden-2020-money-wealth-1221934  In addition, you should also consider how his political position has advantaged his *family*, politically and financially.    He's the consummate pro-corporate Democrat, with a long record:  https://www.vox.com/2019/1/10/18173132/joe-biden-hillary-clinton-2020  Given your user name, I doubt you'll find it credible, but: David Sirota frequently contrasts Sander's progressive record with Biden's neoliberal one on twitter.  Personally I support Sanders, Warren, and, to a lesser extent, Buttigieg.  I want a progressive on the ticket, and to have influence on the cabinet choices and administration's platform.    If Biden is the Democractic candidate, and his running mate is not Sanders or Warren -- highly unlikely, as his politics are the opposite of theirs, and he and Warren actually hate each other -- then there's a good chance I simply won't vote.  I won't be given any compelling reason to go to the polls: I won't vote for more of business-as-usual... and that's Biden.
I mean Sanders is in second. Sanders has been framed as a radical by many sides, so that makes cautious people less likely to trust him.
Barring legislation, no, and legislation would be very risky in this area. The real problem lies in the articles that we click on. If everyone stopped clicking on sensational bullshit, then sensational bullshit would disappear. Unfortunately that runs against human nature. We are the problem.
Let's put it this way, the majority of VPs who run for president get the party's nomination. You have to reach back to Reagan I think (arguably Bush) for it to have been a big state governor. Although I will say that it's an arguable point.  Another way to look at it is that whoever was VP was already selected to be president shall the need arise so in the mind of a voter if someone is good enough for VP they should be logically good enough for VP
I hadn't heard of that, but that's unfortunate because Bernie himself seems like a really great candidate.
http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-bro-myth-sanders-base-more-diverse-2019-3  I wouldn't let a couple of extremists paint an entire group. Or were all Clinton supporters just as militantly "feminist" as Albright when she said there was  "[a special place in hell](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/06/madeleine-albright-campaigns-for-hillary-clinton)" for women who don't support Hillary?   Regardless, we have to keep our eyes on what's really important, finding & supporting a democratic candidate who will defeat Trump. The rise of fascism in America is a danger to us all and we need to remember who is pushing America into the hands of the oligarchy.

Well,  now he is the progressive voice with the most name recognition. I think he has as much a right to run as Warren and other candidates.  I don‚Äôt think we should be antagonistic about Bernie or even Biden. I‚Äôm hoping, that either Warren or Sanders drop out early in the race to support the other so that the progressive vote can become consolidated.  If worse comes to worse, I‚Äôll support the Democratic nominee even if it isn‚Äôt either Sanders/Warren.
The impeachment issue became more salient after the Mueller statement.
>Look at how corporate friendly he made his home state.  Delaware has been the most corporate-friendly state since the 19th century. But sure let‚Äôs blame that all on Biden.  We won‚Äôt get anywhere with silly, ahistorical negativity. Let‚Äôs have a positive primary campaign on the issues and save our insults for Trump.  BTW I support Warren and donate $20 per month to her campaign.
> He has twice the name recognition of any other candidate.  He has about the same as Bernie, and 14% more than Warren. Even adjusting for name recognition he has the best favorability rating, though all of the top tier candidates are pretty close.   [From 538](https://i.imgur.com/TEpwO6h_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)   Regarding his popularity among black voters, there‚Äôs [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/05/07/black-voters-helped-make-joe-biden-democratic-front-runner-will-they-keep-him-there/%3foutputType=amp) from the Washington Post:  ‚ÄúIn these recent polls, Quinnipiac said Biden had 42 percent support among nonwhite Democrats. CNN put his nonwhite support at 50 percent. Biden‚Äôs closest competitor among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters of all races, Sanders, won 14 percent of the nonwhite vote in the CNN poll and 7 percent in Quinnipiac. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) each earned less than 10 percent of the nonwhite vote in these polls. The Hill/HarrisX and Harvard-Harris both have Biden leading Sanders by over 30 points with African American voters.  Public polls don‚Äôt always have a large sample size, so it can be tough to get pinpoint accuracy on the opinions of racial groups. But these numbers suggest Biden has significant backing from some African American voters. And despite Biden‚Äôs less-than-progressive record on issues such as busing and crime, the support he is getting from these voters shouldn‚Äôt be surprising.  Polling data and past election results suggest that black voters are almost uniformly Democratic ‚Äî but not uniformly liberal. And black voters have at times happily supported establishment candidates. That makes Biden, an establishment liberal who served as vice president under America‚Äôs first black president, but whose policy stances are not notably progressive, a decent match for what these voters are looking for in a candidate.‚Äù  What are referring to about his record in the Obama administration?
Hey now, let‚Äôs not be toxic toward the Bernie crowd.  edit: I get it, I'm turned off by his supporters' sub on reddit. I'm just saying why not rise above the trash talking of other DNC front runners, because whoever ends up the candidate will have a backlog of all the other candidates' followers' toxicity towards each other and that's not healthy for whoever ends up being our last hope against Trump.  I say this as a Bernie supporter from 2016 who is leaning Warren this time around.
Yeah, I was pretty grossed out when I learned that Bernie voted for that. That was toxic
I'm not voting for Biden in the primary but to not vote for him in the general is madness. Republicans are destroying the rights of women and POC at a lighting fast pace and allowing them to stay in power will just continue this. I don't have the luxury to not vote in the general. I fucking hate Biden, but I don't hate him as much as I hate every fucking Republican.
Same bullshit spread by Russians about Hillary.  I don't prefer Biden but saying the smear your have against him is unbelievable. Be positive about Democrats ffs
lol, david sirota
The point is that while name recognition obviously helps, it's the fact that you are both recognized **and** liked that leads to Biden's polling lead. He has been the most popular political figure in America after Obama for a while now.
It is depressing that you are correct.
>Another way to look at it is that whoever was VP was already selected to be president shall the need arise so in the mind of a voter if someone is good enough for VP they should be logically good enough for VP  "In the mind of a voter" and "logically" don't go together.  This sort of speculation is usually just after-the-fact logic used to rationalize a conclusion.   >Let's put it this way, the majority of VPs who run for president get the party's nomination.   The Democratic Party nomination process has been completely transformed by crowdfunding. The only advantage connected insiders, like VPs, had was access to corporate donors that let them smother competitors in the crib. That's not a thing anymore and hasn't been, arguably, since 2004.
>we need to remember who is pushing America into the hands of the oligarchy  We're just not working hard enough. Poor people are stealing all of our earnings /s
>[http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-bro-myth-sanders-base-more-diverse-2019-3](http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-bro-myth-sanders-base-more-diverse-2019-3)  They basically cite poll numbers that show people who have a favorable view of Bernie are diverse. But that doesn't refute the Bernie Bro "myth" at all. Since the Bernie Bro "myth" is that young white guys are Bernie's loudest, nastiest, and most committed supporters. Simply rating him either positively or negatively doesn't tell you what his most committed supporters are like.  &#x200B;  >she said there was  "a special place in hell" for women who don't support Hillary?  This is misleading. Her full quote is ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a special place in hell for women who don‚Äôt help each other!‚Äù and it's something of a personal slogan. She has said it way before and in other contexts. She's not saying there's a special place in hell if you don't vote for Hillary. She's saying women need to help each other. Notice everyone who quotes this quotes "a special place in hell" but doesn't quote the full quote, because it reveals it's not exactly what advertised?
Jesus Christ. It never stops.
>prevent the DNC from making a huge mistake  >when you lose by more votes than Trump did in the GE and somehow it's the DNC's fault
Name recognition?  On that ground Biden has it sewed up, right?  For once in my damn life i'd like to someone with a track record of liberal *policy*.  I'm tired of writing in "zombie LBJ" and "zombie FDR" in spaces my party neglects to even contest.    > I don‚Äôt think we should be antagonistic  In the greatest bastion of 2016 Bernie Bros... Fuck that noise.  I voted for him the last primary not because he was a better candidate but because the party needed to move left.  It has.  Dude's done his job. It's time for John the Baptist to make way for Jesus.  Edit:  IRL you can have conversations outside groupthink.  Antagonism is a terrible approach there.
I didn't mean to imply he single handedly made it that way, but he did nothing to make it better, only worse.
The Bernie crowd is nothing but toxic.  They attack Elizabeth Warren and every other candidate that's not Bernie. I've never seen the same from another campaign.  They are the only dividers in this election.
Literally just head over to ESS and you'll see posts documenting the daily desperate attempts of Sanders supporters to bring Warren down. They are the ONE group of supporters to whom my sympathy does not extend
I am a strong believer in leftist principles but the biggest reason I will support any candidate but Bernie is his toxic fan base. Us Warren G's must not become like that
https://youtu.be/wuenGIA3YwI  This 1:30 video of Bernie explaining how awful the crime bill is, but is willing to vote for it as a compromise because it introduced the violence against women act should show his intentions.   He has been screaming about it's obvious dark side & the consequences of it since the beginning. Biden however has continued to defend it even when Bill Clinton who signed it into law admits it was a mistake.
And for me, that's the problem: cycle after cycle, I have to vote for the Lesser Evil.  I'm not going to vote for the Republicans -- so the Democratic machine foists some neoliberal on me, and I have no choice but to vote for them?  My political choice is between white nationalism, and a pro-Wall Street party?  What choice is that?  I do not owe anyone my vote.  If they want my vote, they have to convince me.  They have to give me something to vote *for*, not just *against*.
Please clarify: what qualifies as 'smear' in anything I've said?  You object that I hold Biden accountable for his long pro-corporate, pro-Wall Street record?  How is that unfair, exactly?  (Or pro-Russian, FFS?)  Also: you *do* realize this is the subreddit for *Elizabeth Warren*, right?  Founder of the CFPB?  Proposer of a significant wealth tax?  Proven political adversary of *Joe Biden*? (Go watch their exchanges over bankruptcy legal reforms...)  Hear this: no one gets a pass just because they wear a blue t-shirt.  That was Hillary's position, too: "I'm Not Trump! Vote For Me!"  That wasn't enough to win all the states she needed.  There is a very important lesson there for Democrats, if they're paying attention...    Everyone will be held accountable to their record -- and whatever it is, is of their own making.    I'm going to be just as critical of Biden and his record as Warren has been...
You know, I find your response fascinating.  So somehow you think Sirota is, what, a joke?  Why?  Because he's unapologetically left wing?  Because he works for the Sanders campaign?  What?    His tweets about Biden point to **other journalists' pieces** about Biden's policies and voting record, and contrasts his record with Sanders.  To me, that's actually valuable: on the basis of *his own record*, I can see why I can't cast a vote for Biden.  But hey, you just stay in the peanut gallery, laughing...  when the Biden administration compromises with the Republicans to cut social programs to pay for more wars, I hope they don't cut anything important to you or your family...
Biden isn't really liked so much as not disliked. My impression is that most people know very little about him beyond Obama memes.
I mean we shall see I guess, but Biden is the only VP to run since the crowdfunding you described started and he's in with a commanding lead. I think any VP that runs after a presidency will probably win the nomination. Probably, although not always.  All you have really is "there's precedent, but that doesn't count anymore." But it's not like we have contradictory precedent, just speculation as to why the old precedent doesn't count.
Gonna be the second cycle where Bernie would be the most/2nd most palatable candidate in the field to me but I'm gonna pass on voting for him in the primary because so many of his internet supporters are condescending jackasses with zero self-awareness and generally less subject matter knowledge than the people they're condescending to
[removed]
This is 100% true, regardless of bitter downvotes.  Additionally: Biden is seriously the least energizing choice Democrats could make. Literally nobody is excited about it, it‚Äôs just a bunch of lukewarm statements about ‚Äòelectability‚Äô and ‚Äòname recognition‚Äô. Yeah that‚Äôs inspiring.  Without using Google, what are his main two or three ideas that are going to really help America climb back out of the dark hole it‚Äôs in? Nobody knows, he probably doesn‚Äôt know.
Is this a joke? I like Bernie, and was pro Bernie last primary. If Bernie is more viable than Liz I‚Äôm voting for him strategically, but otherwise I‚Äôm voting Liz cause she‚Äôs Bernie but younger and with more specific policy plans.   At least where I am in the country that‚Äôs boilerplate primary strategy for Bernie peeps, and nobody‚Äôs getting their butt chapped because they remember how terribly that went last time.
>The Bernie crowd is nothing but toxic.  I supported Bernie Sanders. I support Elizabeth Warren. What are you talking about? You're mostly full of it. Hey you know what's toxic? Blanket generalizations that aren't even marginally based in fact.
I dunno wtf ESS is but your vast generalization is the exact toxicity you're whining about. Admit it, you're a bitter Hillary supporter.
Agreed. I actually like Bernie (not nearly as much as warren) but I straight up loathe his cult. I hate seeing this sub emulate some of the the cult subs‚Äô worst tendencies.
That doesn't mean anything if he still signs it, does it? Lots of people have "reasons" for their mistakes. It was disgusting. "Hey man I know this is terrible, but I gotta do it". Cool.
'white nationalism, and a pro-Wall Street party?'  Republicans suppress the vote and stack the courts with psycho judges we can't remove, which makes it harder to give people something to 'vote for' or whatever the fuck. For example, Stacey Abrams was pretty cool, but got cheated out of the governorship because of voter suppression and now abortion will be banned in the state by the crooked governor who stole that election, which will lead women to be maimed and killed because their body autonomy has been taken away. If I was in a red state, one day that could be me. So yeah, I'm still not going to sit back and let the nazis come to power easily when it takes me five fucking minutes to walk into the booth, pick someone who isn't going to be an utter fucking nightmare to anyone who isn't a straight white man, and go on with my day. In the primaries I'll always fight for the best candidate, but if they don't make it, I'm still voting. Voting for the better candidate in the general takes very little time out of my day, and I will always do it.  A lot of communities who have to go through hell just to vote (broken machines, hour long lines, suppression laws) don't have that luxury, and are part of the reason why it is so hard for good candidates to win. I'm not going to sit back and let a Republican win and make that situation even worse. I don't need any convincing to go out and vote against sadists who want to destroy my rights.
Sirota is a joke because he's vehemently and relentlessly not in line with Bernie's expressed desire to unify the party and because he worked with Sanders while pretending to be a serious journalist and calls people who question him "mentally incapacitated". He's gross.   Sanders is probably not going to be the nominee. I think he would be better than Biden as POTUS, but I don't see him getting there. Having a guy like Sirota speak for his campaign is only going to ensure Trump's victory when he loses the primary again.    When the trump administration continues to cut social programs to pay for more wars, I hope they don't cut anything important to you or your family...
Thank you, @CoryBooker . You've always been a powerful voice for justice and equality, and you've made this primary stronger. I know you will continue to be a leader in the fight to defeat Donald Trump and build a stronger future for America.
Good show, Cory. I went from not really liking Booker before the primary to thinking he was actually alright. I loved what he had to say on climate change, marijuana legalization, etc., that he spoke out on issues like violence against trans people of color that don't get enough attention, that he had an [animal welfare](https://corybooker.com/issues/animal-welfare/) plank on his agenda (like what politicians ever talk about this? Be still my vegetarian heart!) It turns out a lot of what I'm not into is just his schtick, which can be kind of OTT, and even if that's still not to my taste I can respect him for being out there with an energetic and passionate voice for the issues he cares about.  Also, I love Rosario Dawson! She was like the boss fight that my homosexuality had to overcome in order for me to achieve full gayness.
I liked Booker a lot. He obviously wasn't my number 1 choice, but I'm sad he wasn't able to make the latest debates and has to drop out.
Booker would be a better VP choice than Castro.
Iowa 2020 Election   [Caucus Voter Pre-Registration Deadline](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fVoterRegistration): January 24, 2020   [Caucus](https://www.aclu-ia.org/en/how-find-your-caucus-site): February 3, 2020   [General Election](https://sos.iowa.gov/elections/voterinformation/index.html): November 3, 2020
With him and Castro gone, I've lost my top two choices in the race after Sen. Warren. Sad to see that happen.
Just last week he called out the media for criticizing EW for things they wouldn't criticize him for. A truely good guy, hope he sticks around in someone else's (Warren's) campaign!
Elizabeth was my first choice, but I love Cory Booker. Also love Julian Castro. We had some great candidates,!
Everything she does just oozes class
In a perfect world, Booker would've been the frontrunner. Besides Warren, I did like him as a candidate. Shame to see him go.
Booker was an excellent candidate‚Äî charismatic speaker, executive *and* legislative experience, a Rhodes scholar, a happy warrior attitude, and one of the best climate action/environmental justice plans in the field. With him and Castro gone, I longer have a second favorite candidate.
I look forward to voting for Booker in the future. He‚Äôs still got many rounds left. I can‚Äôt wait to see his next move.
Booker is a great guy, feel he would have been a strong candidate almost any year. Much like Castro I feel he just didn't have the chance to stand out.  Would still be an excellent VP pick though.
I have gained some respect from Booker during this election cycle but I do feel people should be educated on some of his past that doesn‚Äôt align with a lot of what Warren currently stands for.   https://www.wnyc.org/story/booker-gets-more-wall-street-any-house-senate-member/  Booker at one point was receiving more money from Wall Street than anyone in Congress - next in line behind booker was Mitch McConnell. Booker is even mentioned in the book ‚ÄòDark Money‚Äô for publicly criticizing Obama during his re-election campaign for negative comments about the finance industry that Obama had made.  He‚Äôs said the right things during this campaign but his history is more dubious than practically any other dem candidate if you consider yourself a progressive.

I love how friendly and respectful Warren has always been to her party. Great quality in a leader just look at pelosi
[deleted]
Definitely agree here, as a vegan it was really cool seeing someone promote animal rights. A bit sad seeing him drop out this early.
> Also, I love Rosario Dawson! She was like the boss fight that my homosexuality had to overcome in order for me to achieve full gayness.  This is amazing. Made me laugh.
> I went from not really liking Booker before the primary to thinking he was actually alright.  He walked back on his support for charter schools, which was my main issue with him. (Not JUST the charter school bit, but the general neoliberal "privatize public goods" grift they represent.) It showed he can learn from his mistakes.
He was my definite number two choice personally, and I'm sad to see him go.  I appreciated his voice and his perspective in the race and at the debates.  I feel like I really don't have a number two choice anymore.  Luckily I vote on Super Tuesday and I'd be really shocked if Liz drops out before then, so I don't think I'll have to worry much about that.  I'm all-in for Liz, but I will miss Booker.  Glad to still have him fighting for progress in the Senate!
My number two as well. If we end up going down the moderate path I would have strongly preferred him over Biden.  I have to wonder what would have happened if the likes of Steyer and Bloomberg who claim we need a moderate put their money behind him (or Kamala) rather than entering into the race themselves. Things could look very different.
Warren/Booker has been my dream ticket since day 1.
One advantage of pairing with Castro is he may have an advantage in helping with the border crisis that Trump has created.
Not enough geographic diversity IMHO. Castro being Texan is MASSIVE.
Castro was a part of Obama's cabinet though. Having people from Obama's team isn't a bad thing, especially right now.
I'm down to my pre debates #3 at this point actually.
Same here, it's very disappointing.
Same, lol, not Castro but I liked Harris and Booker.
He is the senator from NJ.  Quite a lot of people who live in NJ work on Wall St.  Thus Wall St represents a significant amount of money for NJ.  Anyone who understands how the system is designed should expect him to support Wall St just like we should not be surprised if Warren took money from biotech firms and defense contractors as a senator from MA.
Yeah, a Booker pick for VP would signal Liz's entire life has been a lie.  Its not going to happen
In his video announcing he was dropping out, he said he would be supporting whoever won the nomination, so that seems less likely to me.  I wonder who that could be.  Where did you find that quote?
>Warren staffers have been saying for days now that they've got a big endorsement coming.   Just wondering, where did you get this from?
>they've got a big endorsement coming.    Oprah???
IIRC [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIEjvJahBLo) was her last ditch effort to turn me straight. It almost worked :P
Liz is in it until the convention. :)
I don't think Steyer is in it for moderation.  He's not a full-bore progressive like Sanders or Warren, but he's a long time climate activist and has a wealth tax as part of his platform.
Same here. Facebook showed me a post I made Jan 6 2018 calling it.
I'm not so sure about that since he isn't from the border. He comes from a border state, sure, but he hasn't run for or won statewide office there and is from San Antonio, which is far from the border. I could see his status as a latinx candidate sending a message to latinx voters, immigrants, and refugees that they are represented by a Warren administration. That's definitely important. But I don't think he has any specific expertise or experience that would help with border issues.
[According to 538 that doesn't make much of a difference.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-overrated-vice-presidential-home-state-effect/)
Slow your roll. It'd be a contradiction of certain things she stands for and I'd expect some explanation of that, but saying it'd signal her entire life has been a lie is absolutely absurd. Not that I expect she'd pick him anyhow.
Building broad coalitions to accomplish your goals doesn't make you a liar.
[She's going to Iowa. Then she's going to New Hampshire. Then she's going to Nevada. Then South Carolina...](https://media1.tenor.com/images/d801bc25daa0b5871e1a672bcedf4f8f/tenor.gif?itemid=4925611)
To add to this, Castro has never run statewide and isn't well-known outside of San Antonio, where he served as mayor. It doesn't seem like his Texan status would translate to much even if those things did tend to matter. If I were going to pick a Texan for his appeal in Texas, it would be the guy who came closest to winning there recently: Beto O'Rourke.
Taking as a VP someone who has had Wall Street and Pharma money funneled into his Senate campaign would be absolute hypocrisy.  Warren won't do it
Is this a Howard Dean reference?
He is the senator from NJ.  Pharmaceutical companies and Wall St employ around 5-10% of the state.  His job is to represent the voters and many have some ties to these businesses.    If he had no ties to these sectors he would have been doing a bad job.    Would you be surprised to discover that Warren has ties to biotech firms because as a Senator from MA that should surprise no one as there is a very active biotech sector in MA.  Remember senators represent their state not the country as a whole.
Almost every Democrat has had Wall Street or Pharma money at some point.  Purity politics don't help progress.  If you're not open to bringing new people into your coalition you will never get anything done.
Did you not click to watch the GIF? Yes it is!

Removed for Rule 4.  Campaign contributions are not bribes and we will not allow comments accusing other Democrats of corruption for receiving them.
Exciting foreshadowing at the Minnesota State Fair
This is a soybean poll at the MN State Fair as of today, though she's been leading the whole time.
I voted here!! I also bought a Warren 2020 pin here üòÅ
Minnesotan here, I‚Äôll have to make sure I show my support for Warren when I go to the fair tomorrow. Believe it or not but Minnesota has deep progressive roots. A lot of people think the Midwest  needs a moderate voice but we actually need the opposite!
Speaking of polls:  > The poll finds a virtual three-way tie among Sanders (20%), Warren (20%), and Biden (19%) in the presidential nomination preferences of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters across the country. Compared to Monmouth‚Äôs June poll, these results represent an increase in support for both Sanders (up from 14%) and Warren (up from 15%), and a significant drop for Biden (down from 32%).  [3-Way Lead as Dem 2020 Picture Shifts](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_082619/)  I sincerely hope that next year, we‚Äôll all have to choose between the greater of two goods.
What are the other large ones? I‚Äôm curious
Those straw polls have no scientific value yet I can't help but keep track of them and be happy when Warren is leading!   Side note: Buttigieg keeps doing very well in those straw polls. That was the case in Iowa too. His actual polls haven't been that great lately but it seems that there's more grassroot support than the polls would indicate.
Beto should take a cue from Hickenlooper and run for the Senate.  He's still very popular and I think Cornyn is much more vulnerable to defeat than Cruz.
Klobuchar in second.. Lol what?
Fake nuts, (that‚Äôs a pun)
IMO this is the most scientific poll of the cycle.
How does it work? Everyone gets one bean? 5 for $1?
Hey one of those is mine!
Thank you for your bean!
I think people love her here because of her union strong messaging. Us Minnesotans love our unions! I also feel that her campaign gives off some Wellstone vibes for people!
Another poll came out today showing a more normal distribution. For now, that Monmouth poll looks like a major outlier to all others and people shouldn't get too excited.
Its sad that that is hard to imagine.
Sample size was small and the maximum margin of error was 5.7%.
Speaking of polls, the majority said Clinton would win in 2016. Polls are shit.
As best I could tell at the time it went Warren > Klobuchar > Buttigieg > Sanders > Harris > *Democrat* > Biden > Yang
Looks like Biden on the far left, and Klobacher Sanders and Harris from tallest to shortest.
I think his performance here has more to do with audiences in MN and IA being more white and midwestern than national audiences, which significantly boosts his appeal. He's still doing quite well in early states because his main demographic, college educated whites, are a larger percentage of the population there.  On the other hand, Biden should really be crushing these straw polls for the same reasons, and he is not...make of that what you will.
Poll is at the Minnesota State Fair. She is from Minnesota... home turf advantage
You have to spend a few minutes answering demographic questions and giving your email address to our state Democrat party, the DFL, and you get one soybean.   I suppose you could do it multiple times with multiple email addresses but that's a lot of effort for a light-hearted, non-scientific poll.
WHAT DOES A BEAN MEAN
Link?
Yep, and with a far bigger sample size.   Love to know how Morning Consult finds 6% of early state voters backing Steyer though.
That is the expected confidence interval.  Most opinion polling has a sample size around 1000 people:  > But the average poll has a sample size of 1,000 adults.  National Council on Public Polls‚Äô FAQ‚Äîhttp://www.ncpp.org/?q=node/6  > Sample size doesn't much depend on the population size, which is counter-intuitive to many.  > Most polling companies use 400 or 1000 people in their samples.  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/166/ddg#172  This does a good job explaining the math:  https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/references/sample-size-surveys  > The mathematics of probability prove that the size of the population is irrelevant unless the size of the sample exceeds a few percent of the total population you are examining. This means that a sample of 500 people is equally useful in examining the opinions of a state of 15,000,000 as it would a city of 100,000.  https://surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm
The majority said she would win the popular vote by 3%. And she did. Learn what polls mean before discounting an entire segment of math & statistics.
The polls in some states were inaccurate, but the national polls were pretty close. If you understand the methodology, you'll understand that polls aren't shit.
Biden was behind that tall one on the far left which was Buttigieg. You can just barely make out the two "i"s in his name if you zoom in. When I go back, I'll try to grab a few more angles for next time. The fair also runs until after labor day, so I'll keep everyone posted.
If she can't even lead in her home state, she needs to drop out. Even O'Rourke has a share of the lead in TX.
Thanks!

He's apparently been dumping his money into ads in Iowa and other early states. Easier/cheaper to get 2% in 4 individual state polls than national polls I guess.  But even so, 6% seems really high.
Yes, this point about sample size is basic statistics. As long as the sample is representative then it doesn't need to be large. And yet the size of the sample is always the first thing people fixate on, especially if they are skeptical about (or simply dislike) the results.
Yeah and she still lost. So what good was polling? It was literally worthless.
That actually makes me happy.  I don't get support for Biden.  I like him as a person, but his time is past.
Buttigieg seems to do well in these types of polls.  He got 2nd in the  Iowa Corn Poll at their State Fair as well, which used the same mechanic but with corn kernels.  Doesn't seems to correlate with his national polling right now.
In the meantime, [here's a snap from the first Saturday of the fair](https://i.imgur.com/S5RvWz0.png) (day three) at a different angle, so you can puzzle out some more names. (Warren was already way ahead (and got my bean), but I took this for some Buttigieg friends.)
Actually many Minnesotans like her, just not for president. The common sentiment I hear is she should stay in Minnesota. She won re-election with 60% of the vote. I would say though the City Pages article does reflect the feelings of their pretty progressive readership.
Yeah, she's, uhhh, [not doing too well locally](http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/the-minnesota-state-fairs-worst-new-food-is-the-amy-klobuchar-waffle/557994931), though at least has *some* name recognition here.
It's time to stick a comb in it, as they say
Oh for sure. I can see a couple percent but I don't get 6.   I also want to know who the hell are people looking at Trump and thinking what we need is another billionaire who wants to buy the Presidency but that's another question.
Iowan here. I can‚Äôt watch a single YouTube video without seeing a Steyer ad. I can‚Äôt imagine how much money he‚Äôs been pumping into it.
[deleted]
Look do you know if this was before or after Bernie made his appearance/speech? It looks like he was doing proportionally better yesterday than in your photo. I wonder if his appearance alone made a difference
I assume people who think you have to fight fire with fire. To give steyer some credit, this dude has been bankrolling causes like gun control, voter registration and turnout, and impeachment for years.  But with so many Dems against big money in politics (even money that supports them) I can't see him ever getting real traction.
There was some recent reporting that he's spending like $200k per day or something insane. Excellent example of why we need to more closely regulate money in politics.
Bernie marched for civil rights and Biden embraced segregation. I honestly have no idea why minorities would support Biden.
Biden‚Äôs support is pretty weak and half hearted, I suspect it‚Äôs mostly name recognition rather than any embracing of issues he‚Äôs behind.
His MPR interview started at 1 or 1:30 on Saturday, and this is probably at about 4 or 5 Saturday. It was definitely after on the same day. The guy I got he survey from (which you needed to complete for the bean) was wearing his shirt.
He did not embrace it.

This is where things stood Saturday in the late morning, beforehand.   https://imgur.com/gallery/ImjxRfN
I‚Äôd like you to notice how specifically you had to phrase that. You didn‚Äôt say anything GOOD in his defense, like that he stood up to racist senators from the segregation era, or that he did like... anything positive for racial dynamics.   Just that, you know, he wasn‚Äôt racist HIMSELF. He just uh... enjoyed hanging out with them and hearing their views and politely debating them over a salmon tartare lunch at the Lafayette.   I have no idea why anyone would look at this field and then look at Biden with his ACTUAL HISTORY OF ACTION and go, Yup, that‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs gonna fight tooth and nail for racial justice.
>No Biden did not.   [Yes he did](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/joe-biden-didn-t-just-compromise-segregationists-he-fought-their-n1021626)
Nice try with the strawmanning. That‚Äôs not what I said about minorities and you know it.   Biden‚Äôs support among minorities appears to stem mainly from his connection to Obama and an implied continuation of his policies. Not because they love Biden‚Äôs specific Medicare proposals or his foreign policy ideas. Go and read FiveThirtyEight if you don‚Äôt believe me.   Frankly the more minorities find out about Biden‚Äôs past positions like bussing or the 90‚Äôs crime bill and his refusals to apologize, they less they support him. Though I don‚Äôt disagree with your above edit that minority support of progressive policies is weaker than most people think.
Quick, somebody get the bean counters working on these images!
Lol, I didn't phrase anything on purpose. You're reading way too into my brief response. I just know it's not worth a discussion because everyone is evil except Bernie for most people on r/politics.
[deleted]
No, I‚Äôd love to have a discussion with you. Especially because I put either Harris or Warren in my top spot.   You should not make assumptions. I‚Äôm a socialist, but I‚Äôm also a tactical voter.
"Just that, you know, he wasn‚Äôt racist HIMSELF. He just uh... enjoyed hanging out with them and hearing their views and politely debating them over a salmon tartare lunch at the Lafayette. "  This here doesn't give the impression of someone willing to have a conversation.  Bussing was a shitty situation because of the asshole racists of Boston. It ended up setting up BAD situations, the violence was terrible. I know because my parents and aunt's and uncles went through it, as did my friends parents and we've discussed it at length. Now, do you let the violence go on day after day? For Christ sake the Irish mob was even contributing to the violence ("Whitey was notoriously opposed to the busing plan, sponsoring militant violence against the pro-busing Boston Globe and the Kennedy homestead in Brookline."). The violence against black students was increasing. Everyone is so quick to call the guy a racist to pile on the shit, but in this case, it was extremely complicated. But God forbid I admit this, because then I'm a racist by people who don't even know me OR the situation first hand.

That's not even where we are right now. ü§î
>If you have to say "you don't get" why a candidate has support you aren't trying to understand how to build a coalition - TRATIA  And in defense of that statement, you wind up at:  >I just know it's not worth a discussion because everyone is evil except Bernie for most people on r politics. - Cobrawine66  Nice coalition building, good Sir! You really showed those progressives who's unwilling to have a conversation.
Did I say he advocated for it? No. Why do you feel the need to twist my words in order to defend a guy who defended segregation?
Charlotte + Liz = üòç
She is simply the best candidate.  It's depressing, because I like Sanders but I can't shake the feeling that a lot of his popularity is this idea that's been drilled into people's brains that he is the only one fighting. That he is just on another level of care than anyone else.  It's simply not true. He's human. He's made mistakes. He has things to judge and critique.  I would be perfectly happy having Sanders as president. However, when I sit down and look over the words and thoughts of him and Warren, Warren is undisputedly better for me.  I just wish I had more faith people had done he same and made their own decision, instead of going in with a preconceived notion that Sanders is the gold standard.
Charlotte has raised over $100k for Warren in the past 48 hours! üò≥
This sort of outreach is why she's the candidate for me.  I'm tired of my way or the highway being the order of the day.  I'm looking for someone who has spent their lifetime building coalitions as that's what the democratic party is at it's core a *coalition of people with similar, but somewhat divergent ideas*.  I hope Warren comes on stage and Hungry Hungry Hippos every candidate on stage then waltzes through a few more of her plans which haven't been stolen without any credit by a different candidate.  Said it before, it's not that Warren deserves to be president, it's that America deserves to have a President like *Warren*.  We **deserve** to see crisis on the horizon and rest easy knowing our leader has the skills to keep our loved ones safe.  We **deserve** to have a president who speaks to all of us as equals, rather than dividing us into categories by loyalty.  We **deserve** to have a president who says "everything will be alright" whom we *believe* because she's never lied to us before and damnit if she's wrong she fought tooth and nail to make it the truth and will keep fighting till the last breath leaves her body.  I truly hope we reach out and snatch what we deserve in this primary else, as usual, we will deserve what we get.
It's great to see a real candidate go out of their way to reach voters, especially in the LGBTQ community!
Could someone explain who Charlotte is for someone out of the loop, please?
She'd make a fantastic president

Human beings tend to favor stories and narratives over what's real. Stories are more exciting, more pure, and are tailored for our imagination. I think the story of Sanders is what draws so many people to him. And that's a great thing, because it's inspired a lot of people to get involved in the political process.  But once you get past the story of Sanders, and the story of Warren (particularly the negative narratives about her), you see that Warren is \*more\* exciting than any story. She has flaws, and we've all seen them in the past few years, but man, what she says, what she does, and how she fights, is what gets me motivated, more than any other presidential candidate in my lifetime.
>It's depressing, because I like Sanders but I can't shake the feeling that a lot of his popularity is this idea that's been drilled into people's brains that he is the only one fighting. That he is just on another level of care than anyone else.  I feel like this sometimes but I've been working on trying to ignore that because ultimately my happiness with Bernie or Elizabeth or any of the other candidates as POTUS shouldn't really be dependent on how other people think and feel.   I get there are electability arguments and such but I feel like when thinking about Bernie or whoever being President I shouldn't really consider whether his supporters thought he was the only one who could do it or not. I've been in a lot better mood since I've started focusing on that line of thinking.   Makes me think more of how Bernie or even Biden or Pete would be such a massive upgrade from Trump and how much less stress and anxiety I'd have daily rather than focusing on how some of their supporters were jerks on Twitter or Reddit or whatever. Doesn't excuse those people but honestly they don't matter to me in the end.   That said I hope all these mental exercises are for nothing and Warren wins the nomination. That way I don't have to bother with any of it.
> I can't shake the feeling that a lot of his popularity is this idea that's been drilled into people's brains that he is the only one fighting. That he is just on another level of care than anyone else.  Probably because that's the narrative his campaign is spreading (#OnlyBernie was literally trending on Twitter after the very same debate in which Warren crushed Bloomberg's windpipe), which I personally find more insulting towards his supposed good friend & progressive ally than "we talked & he thought sexism would hurt my chances against Trump."  But low-information voters gonna low-information vote. ‚òπÔ∏è
He essentially became a meme during the 2016 election and all young people of a certain ilk decided before 2020 even started that they were ride or die with Bernie, to the point of online harassment, without once looking at anything other than what happened in 2016. I‚Äôm glad he ran then and he brought a lot of important topics to the national conversation, but the blind fealty he has from young extremely online people concerns me.
Nuanced opinions not allowed!!
As a Bernie supporter, I hope, and think it would be foolish if he were to not, that Liz would be involved majorly in a Sanders administration.
So can I share some unpopular opinion kinda?   I'm a fan of Warren, but given current results and polls, Sanders has run away with this. Something would have to significantly change for him to get the nomination. (Which is not bad. Liz is my #1 but Bernie is a strong #2.)   But what if he is President now and then followed by Liz? If Liz doesn't win this election, why wouldn't she run again in 4 or 8 years?   Just pondering this and wondering what some other Warren Warriors think on this.
This. Her outreach, and not railing against any "establishment" (which, has it's issues, but I don't feel like a primary in which it runs is the place to air those grievances), makes her feel like the most inclusive candidate.
Provide sources or don't post it at all.
Idk to me Liz‚Äôs story is much more compelling. A woman from the Midwest who grew up financially challenged and wasn‚Äôt too interested in politics during her early life. She became a special education teacher, then went to law school and rose the ranks to become a Harvard professor despite being a woman in a very male dominated field. And then once she started understanding the challenges working families face in this country, she decided that getting involved in government was how she would most be able to fix the problem. It‚Äôs a humble, unselfish story that I find more appealing than Bernie‚Äôs story. But the advantage is Bernie has been able to tailor his image since 2016. Most of the general public in my opinion think he‚Äôs the guy who started this progressive movement, the guy they know is fighting for them, and that‚Äôs what they stick to. Liz has had less time to get her story out there on the national stage, but to me, it‚Äôs much more aligned with a majority of American working families.

i'm hanging it on a contested convention. i don't think 3 states is enough to say he's "run away with" anything yet - bill clinton didn't win a single primary until super tuesday. hitting bloomberg last week put some major wind in her sails and hopefully - HOPEFULLY PLEASE GOD - hitting bernie today gave her more momentum and reason for people to consider her *instead of* him. when i told my MIL i was voting for warren she asked me what was the point of voting for someone who had no chance and i said "she has a chance as long as i vote for her." if i'd had more time i'd have brought up her recent fundraising & polling but we were on our way out the door.  but i think in the event of a contested convention, if warren can rack up some second-place delegate numbers, she could make the case to moderate delegates/superdelegates that HER positions and plans, at least, are well-researched and data-driven and will actually accomplish good thinks for americans, the way her CFPB did. bernie's got nothing on that front, just a lot of rabble-rousing.
I think it is what it is. There‚Äôs a small foolish part of me that still hopes Warren will suddenly move into 2nd place, but I know it‚Äôs unlikely. We‚Äôll know for sure in a week when Super Tuesday hits. The only thing I‚Äôll say is that I hope Bernie sees past the spat he and her had and asks her to be VP.
Sure, Pretty well known as a grifter. Honestly very likely making up that Elizabeth Warren called her.

And then once she started understanding the challenges working families face in this country, she decided that getting involved in government was how she would most be able to fix the problem.   This story is what drew me to her above any other candidate! She not only became a Harvard professor, she became a super star in her field and is the third most cited scholar in commercial law (a huge accomplishment even compared to other Harvard law professors). Despite coming to government late in life, with the creation of the CFPB, she's still managed to achieve more than many lifelong politicians. She rises to the top of any field she enters, and I have no doubt she would make an unparalleled president.

Removed for trolling.
i mean she's already polling 2nd nationally.   i just feel like so much of her potential would be wasted as VP. best-case scenario he co-opts all of her plans and she gets no credit. worst-case scenario he digs in his heels with his my-way-or-the-highway style and she's muzzled and nothing gets done and the country isn't willing to vote for another democrat for 8+ more years.
I think pulling into 2nd with delegates is completely plausible
She‚Äôs so smart, well read, insightful, talented, and passionate while also being empathetic, compassionate, attentive, understanding, and humble. Basically she‚Äôs a badass mothereffing superwoman.

> woman from the Midwest who grew up financially challenged and wasn‚Äôt too interested in politics during her early life. She became a special education teacher, then went to law school and rose the ranks to become a Harvard professor   It's literally right there.
I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs true, but like I said I‚Äôm waiting (in agony) for Super Tuesday to know for sure. Right now, FiveThirtyEight places her at a 0.4% chances of winning the nomination. But on the side of a little bit of hope, they place the chance of No One winning at 43%, which I guess would leave her as a viable option at a brokered convention.
Personal story isn't why I'm choosing Warren, but it is ***incredibly important*** in a campaign. In a campaign, you have to define yourself and define your opponent before they can impose their narrative on you.   The Republicans constantly pushed the idea that Obama wasn't an American: the Bill Ayers thing, Jeremiah Wright, the madrassas, saying his middle name over and over again, and countless other things they did to try to paint him as unAmerican.   To fight back, he relied on his story. Growing up in Kansas and Hawaii. Organizing in Chicago. Living the American dream of working your way up to Harvard and beyond. It helped fight all subtle ways in which the GOP tried to define him.   Warren has an incredible story, one that connects with working men and women, with parents, with the middle class, anyone who had to bust their asses and work to get where they are. It's very motivating and she will need it in the general.
It's about the solutions, but it should also be about if they'll do a good job as President. Warren's story tells me she can examine issues closely, change her mind based on data (realizing the issue with bankruptcy, etc.) and find appropriate solutions. A solution is great but if they don't have the right mindset and ability to act on data, then I don't believe they'll be effective in implementing those solutions.
Not to be rude, but I feel like you're interpreting my comment in the least charitable way possible. I'm not saying her personal story is the only reason I'm voting for her. I'm saying it's what initially drew me to her. And part of her personal story is her history of getting things done and being extremely competent at everything she's attempted. I'd say this is an essential part of "fixing the problems people face."
Personal story is important for many people because a background of hard work and empathy for others and aspiration to educate and improve the lives of others demonstrates the capabilities of a great leader.
By that logic my candidate has a much broader view of who counts as "us."
[removed]
They also gave HRC like a 90% chance to win the election? Sooooo I don't know. They nailed 2008 but they just don't seem as good since imo.   But more to the point, what I said was it's completely plausible she pulls into second in delegates.
>Personal story isn't why I'm choosing Warren, but it is ***incredibly important*** in a campaign.   And who has a better story... than Bran the Broken?  SORRY, I COULDN'T RESIST üòÇ
Competence and empathy are the qualities I think her story really illuminates for me.
[removed]
Yeah, Sanders was happy to "fight" when it meant showing up to rallies when these were considered fringe issues. But in 2006 he started talking about how civil unions were good enough when people in Vermont were fighting to get married.  And unlike Warren, he wasn't a private citizen when he pulled this shit. But I guess we have to forget about the conservative stances he had on gay marriage, regime change, crime, guns, and immigration during the 90s and 00s.
They gave her a 71% chance of winning (65% 24 hours beforehand). And for better or for worse that was an estimation based on 0 votes being cast whereas some votes have already been cast in this primary. I‚Äôm still hoping for the best, regardless.
>And who has a better story... than Bran the Broken?  EVERYONE! They ALL have a better story! Given me back Hodor you crippled male Kristen Stewart!
For real tho.   Honestly, that finale was probably more prescient than we thought.
Empathy is a huge amount of it for me, as well as following the data. I feel like Bernie's in it less because he cares about my struggles and more because he's just naturally inclined to acts of rebellion.
uh, her policies on racial injustice, gender discrimination, LGBTQ equality, immigration reform, reparations? ask bernie what he thinks about white males having a disproportionate amount of power in this country. it's demonstrable fact that there's a race & gender disparity in wealth & power - which is why liz acknowledges it, because she follows the data and she LISTENS to people's lived experiences. bernie calls my lived experience "identity politics." not to mention if i say i prefer liz's medicare plan because i get on it right away instead of having to wait who knows how long for the full bill, i'm "compromising" and "not a true progressive" when I NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR NOW, DAMMIT.   liz is the only politician i have EVER donated to. i'm on an extremely limited income and do not have the money to "throw away" on political campaigns. but liz is the first candidate who makes me feel HEARD. i don't feel heard by bernie, i feel pushed around. he doesn't try to convince me to vote for him by listening to my concerns & considering other options, he commands me to "get behind him." liz doesn't talk about people "getting behind her," she talks about people *fighting* ***with*** *her*.
He was also quite happy to go to those rallies and kept running failing political campaign after failing political campaign trying to enter politics while ignoring his son and not paying child support.  There's a privilege when it came to being a radical that Bernie had and Liz didn't.
[r/freefolk has entered the chat] lol
A difference I see in Bernie‚Äôs narrative and Liz‚Äôs narrative is a lack of a personal story with the former. It‚Äôs not necessarily bad, but when Bernie talks I know what he wants to do as president, but I don‚Äôt know why exactly he wants to be president. A lot of people criticized Hillary for it in 2016, too. With Liz, I know why she‚Äôs running. It may not matter much for people who value only policy and platform in a candidate, but knowing why you‚Äôre personally invested in wanting to hold the highest office in our government is important for me.
> when Bernie talks I know what he wants to do as president, but I don‚Äôt know why exactly he wants to be president  YES! i'm personally skeptical of anyone who's been in politics as long as he has and is only just now aiming for the presidency. i actually got it with hillary, you know, she did the law school thing, married a guy who was into politics, ended up governor's wife, then FLOTUS, wanted to be able to do more but FLOTUS was basically window dressing in that era (probably still is to a large degree), so she became a senator, then secretary of state... moving up to the presidency made sense for hillary. bernie's been content to spend the last 30 years in congress, not really making much of a name for himself, not advancing beyond it, and seemed to see 2016 as more of a "literally no one else is running, may as well?" kind of shot.   but like you, i get why warren's running. hell, i see a lot more of OG obama in her than in bernie or biden. she was just a bit more cautious than he was (maybe too cautious, we'll never know). and i really just can't stress enough the importance of how i can see that she's taking in all the information, analyzing it, strategizing the most effective path forward. i have so much respect for intelligence and research and adherence to data, probably more than a lot of voters. i would truly rather vote for someone with an IQ of 148 who says "i'm going to do this but i'm not going to do that and here's why and i've calculated that this will happen if i do that..." than someone who yells "REVOLUTION!" and expects me to just trust that they know what they're doing and have a plan not to lead us into a pit full of punji sticks.
Vox: Elizabeth Warren now leads the Democratic primary field in Iowa
Great job, everyone -- now keep fighting to the finish line!
[removed]
What are you talking about?
Warren has been an constant advocate for progressive policy for a long time. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that.   What I am starting to worry about though, is the stability of some of the Sanders faithful (I love Bernie too, btw) going forward, if he keeps slipping in the polls, and eventually loses the primary. They really seem to be showing their teeth lately (or maybe it‚Äôs their ass they are showing), and I don‚Äôt find it to be all that helpful to the situation.
Jesus Christ almighty, you can't even do sarcasm right...
I'm curious - I assume you're a Bernie voter, yeah? I like Bernie a lot, I vacillate between him and Warren for who I'm most excited about. If Bernie does not win the nomination, how do you plan to vote in the general if it's Warren or (god forbid) Biden?
They deleted their comment, but from the other replies, I think it's important to mention that Bernie supporters online are being heavily targeted by misinformation and widely impersonated to try and drive a wedge in the Democratic field.  I suspect what we saw here is one of those impersonators.  There was a good r/activemeasures thread about this not too long ago: https://www.np.reddit.com/r/ActiveMeasures/comments/d5onxn/prominent_prosanders_subreddit_wayofthebern  Remember we're all in this together, every Democratic candidate we have in the race will be better than Trump, and we need to rally behind and fight for whoever wins.
I wonder if it's part of an attempt by agitators (foreign, domestic, whatever) aka trolls to make Bernie supporters seem worse than they are. There's some bizarre Bernie/Tulsi support which makes no sense on a number of levels and yet it's consistently on their sub and also mentioned/supported by bots and trolls on twitter.  The best way to maintain civility is to appeal to the most reasonable Bernie supporters, just as it is for any other groups who aren't already aligned with Warren.
im a big supporter of warren and bernie, my votes going yang as long as hes in the race as I believe his policies best address stay at home mothers. but the main difference between the 2 support groups behind warren and bernie seems to be compassion. im only speaking from personal experience but warren supporters are just more willing to discuss the ideas, share information etc etc. shoot id argue the only reason im not voting warren is that shes taken corporate money.any in my own experience  I asked why federal jobs guarantee is better than ubi and they banned me from the bernie subreddit. I just think perhaps and dont take this the wronf way, there are far more women on warrens subreddit and it shows. which isnt at all a bad thing. if anything if warren hadnt said she didnt believe in automation i might have more faith in her economic policy than yangs.but the fact she missed that, and that being my job indirectly is to automate other jobs. i just cant trust shes still as informed about economic policy as she once was.
To paint a more complete picture, the disinformation campaign we as Democrats are up against hits both directions at once.  Using Bernie supporters as an example, but this is applicable to all groups, including Warren supporters:  1.  Genuine groups of the target demographic are targeted with information to drive their online behavior and beliefs to become more useful.  Internally, this comes in the form of:  - Inflammatory posts about other candidates  - Fake articles about other candidates attacking theirs - Upvote botting of posts and comments containing or encouraging in- vs out-group thought - Impersonating supporters of other candidates making assholes of themselves - Upvote botting comebacks against that impersonator (to reward attacking supporters of that candidate)   .2.  This is also replicated in behavior external to this group, by either doing or encouraging what we just saw.  Their supporters are impersonated in our subreddits with posts designed to get a massive negative response, training US to associate that behavior with Sanders supporters.  The point is to encourage adversarial behavior from both ends until it becomes a self-sustaining feedback loop.  This is also what happened in r/politics where you see massively upvoted comments claiming anyone who voted GOP is incapable of empathy or in some way subhuman.  It's important to understand that anyone engaging in online political discussion is a target, not just specific groups being leveraged.
Anytime I hear someone talk favorably about Tulsi (particularly those on the right), I always assume that they are consuming media with nefarious sources.
You're in luck, because she hasn't "taken corporate money." What she said is that she didn't "believe in unilateral disarmament" in the general from big donors. (No one has asked Bernie if he would take big donor money in the general if it meant defeating Trump, so until someone does, I think that line of attack is overblown, tbh).   As far as I know, Warren's statement on automation was just that she didn't think it was as big a problem as outsourcing was based on a study she had cited. Which study would you recommend instead?
Elizabeth Warren has a plan to get rural Americans broadband internet
My favorite fucking thing about the Warren campaign is she keeps rolling out great fucking ideas and I think, "Shit, what a no brainer. Of course we should do that!"   I want to live in Warren's America so fucking bad.
Butbutbut I thought Chairman Khajiit Varadaraj Pai said eliminating net neutrality would bring rural Americans broadband through increased competition! Are you saying the creature lied to us??  In seriousness, this is one of Warren's best proposals, and that's saying something. Given how much of a hot button topic broadband Internet has become recently, I really hope this helps with her appeal to rural voters.
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/7/20757705/elizabeth-warren-broadband-digital-divide-broadband-access) reduced by 84%. (I'm a bot) ***** > Warren&#039;s broadband plan would grant $85 billion in federal money to subsidize building out broadband networks in rural communities.  > Warren&#039;s plan addresses the deep digital divide in the US, where around 39% of Americans in rural areas don&#039;t have access to high speed internet, compared to 1.5% of Americans in urban areas, according to the FCC. That&#039;s largely because building out broadband networks across vast swaths of the rural US is expensive.  > Joe Biden has said he would invest $20 billion in rural broadband infrastructure, and triple the amount of funding to expand broadband access in rural areas.   ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/cn65xu/america_has_a_terrible_digital_divide_elizabeth/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.02, ~418225 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **broadband**^#1 **rural**^#2 **access**^#3 **American**^#4 **Warren**^#5
This is the agenda pivot I was expecting. She‚Äôs going to start going after the moderate Dems that are supporting Biden. Expect more policy proposals centered around rural America and messages that will appeal to moderate Dems.
It's getting increasingly difficult to do simple things like find a job or do your homework without internet. Rural Americans flock towards Republicans because they like someone who shares their discomfort with immigrants and gay people. In turn, those Republicans slash infrastructure funding and leave lower-middle class rural Americans without important tools like internet. This is an amazing policy and strategy from Warren.

The military will love this too.  I'm frightened of retaliation and censureship from Comcast though.
And she does it again, another plan that makes sense, and is a win-win for all Americans (unless your Comcast/Verizon etc)
Didn‚Äôt we already give ISPs huge tax breaks to do this? Wasn‚Äôt that the agreement at one time?
I want this so bad. I live in Tennessee and so many of my friends and relatives do not have a strong internet connection. I teach at a university that offers 100% online degrees to students who don't have the bandwidth to take their classes, thus putting the burden on us to come up with ways to get material to students who can't get online.
Excellent! Increase the rural communities ability to access information, increase their ability to be self sufficient, increase their freedoms, allow them to enrich their lives more, enable flourishing of the rural communities. Let's not let the right keep their strangle hold of information and coral their possibilities.
This sounds like the time to plug /r/ruraldemocrats
That's nice and all.. But we need a complete over haul with fiber optic across all populated areas in the country. The internet we have to put up with from IPs is a joke.
Honestly, I'm not sure that building our cable infrastructure is the right move at this point. 5g towers should be built out to cover these areas. They will likely provide better speeds at a lower cost.
Elon musk is already on this, except he has bigger plans than this nobody.
Don‚Äôt worry McConnells America will always be there to stop any of this.
She should also sell it as job creation. Building it out will create jobs, and having access to it gives folks more opportunities. Remote work and remote education are increasing every day.
Fuck Ajit Pai
It's a huge issue for telemedicine in rural Western North Carolina. Hospitals are closing. Rural doctors are leaving.   They think they can get Broadband to only the schools. So, that's where the telemedicine clinic will be too. LOL
Fuck I'm a liberal in rural America and want Verizon to finish their job.
I think this could play out in a significant way at the national level if Warren were to get the nomination.  Rural America has been up to this point essentially conceded to the GOP. But there is potential opportunity, Trump hasn't really done much to help these folks. And a lot of farmers have been hurt by Trump's reckless trade war. She has already released a plan already to help American farmers. Yes, the divide between Rural vs Urban is so polarized it may seem pointless, but if anything showing you care is a good first step.

They'll just give more money to Biden like they've been doing  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø   screw comcast
We'll have to see what MSNBC says.
It's my understanding that for rural Americans, 5G isn't really efficient. Its high frequency means that there needs to be an antenna about every 500 feet, which just isn't practical in a rural setting. Running high-speed broadband is way more effective.
Either way, you risk regional monopolies. The point of her plan is to expand the public option.
5g is short range. It wouldn't be good for rural.
Npr had an intelligence guy on a few months ago talking about the risks of 5g from a national security standpoint.  Because so much of the hardware is closed to the US , he was saying we cannot trust 5g communications to be secure.  Something along those lines.  It has a lot to do with China being the major player in providing 5g hardware... I think.   Shit... My memory is shot.  These last three years have certainly taken their toll.
There's one major problem with this that never gets talked about: assuming 5G is remotely as fast as they say, customers will use up all their bandwidth in a short time and have their connections throttled.  Then there's the build out, which with all wireless standards is spotty at best (and downright terrible for large swaths of the country). There are still places near my house where you can't get 4G or even it's slower cousin, LTE. And this is years after the initial push to get the service out. I live about forty miles northwest of DC, so it's not like I'm in the boonies.  And there are other problems listed in this thread. Honestly, 5G sounds great, but it's not going to solve this problem. And will not be as fast as last mile fiber can be.
You'd need like several 5G towers for a single farm.  And that's not just to have reception over the entire farm (which probably isn't necessary)--that's just to get the signal across the farm from the nearest tower outside the farm, to the actual house.
With an inspiring candidate/ president we have a good shot of flipping the Senate in 2020 or 2022!
Agreed with this. While we're at it, open up the internet service provider business. Break up big ISP's and allow local towns and cities to take control of their own communications.   FDR's New deal created new jobs programs by focus on parks and infrastructure, Warren can do it with expanding tech and throw it into the green New deal.
Big time. I remote work and sort of digital nomad. I have to tether to LTE anytime I travel outside a major metro and it keeps me from spending time/money in small towns.   I get better internet in rural Thailand than I do in US towns.
John Oliver said it best: "Ladies and gentlemen, that man is a goober."
I mean I don‚Äôt think you can deny that mass shootings are a problem regardless of the statistical likelihood, and minimizing the problem based on the statistical likelihood is pretty disrespectful to everyone that‚Äôs died in a mass shooting, everyone that survived a mass shooting, and everyone that was affected by it. Although it‚Äôs statistically insignificant, no one should die in a Walmart, at a concert, in a school, in a church, at a nightclub, etc. There has to be something that changes. Universal background checks or behavioral screenings, assault weapons ban, magazine limits. These things should be supported by everyone, even responsible gun owners. The integrity of the gun industry and the gun community is at stake too, and it only makes sense to be in favor of measures that help to uphold that integrity. No one would care how many guns people had if everyone was a responsible gun owner. It‚Äôs the white supremacist mass shooters that ruin it for everyone, so shouldn‚Äôt we be trying to make sure they can‚Äôt get guns capable of killing a dozen people in just seconds?  But I get what you‚Äôre saying. It seems like a lot of Democrats really don‚Äôt know much about guns at all, and it needs to be made more clear that they do not want to take everyone‚Äôs guns away. We play into that narrative from the right way too easily. I come from a relatively rural area as well and I know *a lot* of people that have them. While I personally have no desire to own a gun, the vast majority of these people are smart, responsible gun owners, and attacking them only makes the issue worse. I can totally see how it‚Äôs alienating, and I don‚Äôt think we should focus on it. There‚Äôs hardly anyone that would not vote or vote for someone else because a candidate isn‚Äôt tough enough on guns, especially given the opponent. It‚Äôs a hill we can‚Äôt afford to die on while the issues like the ones you mention exist.
That is correct. Millimeter waves utilized for 5G telecoms have high attenuation coefficients due to resonant absorption by atmospheric gases.
I need to read the proposal.  I think that's great as long as it's not operated by the government.  Last thing we need to do is give them direct control over private communications.
5G will likely inherently remove the need for data caps. Or at the very least it will allow much much higher data caps.
Right. I knew that. /s
A public option is operated by the government... at least, municipal governments in this case.
The government should own the network and we can build encryption into it. Have a VPN between every modem and the ISP. Have the ISPs lease access to the network and use contractors for maintenance. This is how the electric grid works in a lot of places already.
Yeah but that isn't profitable!
Not likely. Much too lucrative to force people to pay extra fees to overcome their data caps.
Warren leads Senate on calling for Alex Acosta to resign
okay this is a really dumb question and I feel like I should know this, but why the hell is the secretary of labor dealing with epstein‚Äôs plea deal
Good on her, I love it.  He should be gone 100 times over.  Moreover, he should have never been appointed in the first place.  Fuck this administration's ethical practices (or lack thereof), and I hope more Democratic Senators take a strong stance on this.  Acosta has no place in that valuable of a cabinet position.
https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html  Shout out to Miami Herald and the journalists Julie Brown, who STAYED on this story until SDNY got to it. FBI even thanked her for her reporting!
Why aren‚Äôt people calling on trump to resign?
A sweet heart deal for a guy who sold girls for sex. Where is the outrage from Evangelicals who say they care about children.   Thanks so much to Warren.
[Acosta broke the law](https://www.ft.com/content/13df89ee-3628-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5) so if he doesn't resign, it's time to impeach him.  Let's have the Republicans vote on whether they side with a man who illegally broke the rules to give a billionaire pedophile a slap on wrist and his co-conspirators immunity. Plus it will make the Democrats less hesitant about impeaching Trump.
Our fearless leader

He was the prosecutor on a similar case involving Epstein over a decade ago
[You should really read this](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/all-we-know-about-the-new-case-against-jeffrey-epstein.html)
He was just a US attorney in 07 when he was the one to give Epstein the deal.
Acosta was Epstein‚Äôs attorney in the first trial. He was responsible for getting him to plead guilty and receive no punishments for it, as part of that plea deal, codefendants of said case (one of whom was Donald Trump) could not be tried for any crimes related to Epstein.
I see your excellent idea and raise you the resignation of the entire administration.
literally everyone is, but calling on his resignation won't do anything without an impeachment.
In which Epstein was sentenced to barely any jail time and was allowed to leave the jail six days a week to go to "work."  After sex trafficking *dozens of underage girls*
He was a federal prosecutor in Miami, not Epstein‚Äôs attorney. Acosta coordinated a sketchy plea deal for Epstein which basically amounted to a slap on the wrist for significant crimes. There is increased attention on his past actions now because federal prosecutors in NY have just brought similar charges against Epstein.
He can resign at any time for any reason.  He‚Äôs no longer protected from criminal prosecution if he does though.
Importantly, Acosta also got immunity for any "co-conspirators" -- of which Trump was likely one. So now Trump and anyone else involved in that incident can't be prosecuted for it. This is likely why Acosta was given the Labor Sec position.
Our country is such a disgusting shit show
Oh, so Acosta is even worse than I thought
I'd be a bit cautious in pegging Trump as a co-conspirator yet. Vox has a good article that goes over some of the connections between him and Epstein, and its tenuous at best.   https://www.vox.com/2019/7/9/20686347/jeffrey-epstein-trump-bill-clinton  I mean, Trump being a serial sexual harasser and accused rapist, I could see him liking Acosta simplu for getting Epstein off easy. Think of it like a gross job interview. But I think it's too early to speculate whether Trump is guilty of the same crimes as Epstein.
Yep! Definitely needs to go.
I'm not speculating, I'm repeating "Jane Doe," a 13-y/o model who brought charges against Trump after, at four different orgies that Epstein hosted, Trump initiated sexual contact, the last time tying her to a bed and raping her. In the court filings is a declaration from an Epstein employee who says she personally witnessed these encounters go down. Acosta's deal with Epstein's lawyer (Dershowitz) exempted Trump from prosecution for the Jane Doe rape in the process.  &#x200B;  edit: The Miami Herald has been doing great work tracking all this. Check their work out and consider supporting them.  edit edit: check out [JusticeforKatie.com](https://JusticeforKatie.com) as well
Yeah, that's actually one the Vox article points out are kinda flimsy. If I read it right she withdrew her accusation too. It could absolutely be true, I'm just cautious of jumping the gun on this. Vox is fairly left-leaning so if they're hesitating I'm inclined to do so too.   That said, I hope they dig in and bring everyone else they find down along with this scumbag.  EDIT: Thanks for the links also. I haven't actually read the original Herald report yet, but I need to. That's what journalism is supposed to be.
She didn‚Äôt withdraw her accusation; she dropped the case out of fear.
Warren Pledges To Release Impeachment Docs Withheld By WH
This is one of the reasons she impresses me so much- she not only sees the problem, but thinks 10 steps ahead on how to address it. That‚Äôs good leadership. Have any other candidates said anything like this or come up with a post-trump anti corruption plan like her recent one? She‚Äôs really showing her chops here with this trial
it's gonna be so stupid if she doesn't win. She's everything we need right now.
YES. She really is leading the fight. She‚Äôs ahead of the rest of them on everything!
This is great. I just don't understand why her platforms and anti-corruption doesn't seem to be resonating with the Iowan electorate compared to everyone else's status-quo policies?
God, I hope this wins her more support. I love that she is avoiding the "let's move forward" rhetoric. We can't "move forward" until we acknowledge what was done.
Would the WH just commit to destroying everything before that?  Doesn't seem like breaking the law is much of a deterrent for this one.
will she pledge to prosecute?  * trump  * barr   * pence  * pompeo   * perry (oops)  * nunes  * rudy   And for Russiagate:  * trump  * barr  * kushner  * dtj  * rudy
To be fair, the only potential Democratic President that might withhold such info is Tulsi Gabbard (ha..........)
This is why I like her the most.  Ya, I love her plans and I hope we can have the house and the Senate so that we can pass those plans.  But if the Senate stays Red and McConnell refuses to pass a single piece legislation, Warren has a plan to do the most good exclusively through the Office of the President.  She is the best person for the job.
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre gonna win with Warren!
I worry that too much we‚Äôre in the stupid timeline
The good news is that she has shown she doesn't need to be President to make her dreams and plans a reality, such as the CFPB.  I'm absolutely voting for her, but I'm confident if she doesn't make it, the future President can't ignore her plans.
Because members of MY party aren‚Äôt corrupt.  They‚Äôre angels and only Republicans have corruption problems, so as long as I vote Dem, I‚Äôm good!
Because the people who control the media are terrified of her.
also while we're at it will she fine/imprison KAC and Ivanka for violating the Hatch Act?
I was also impressed with her NYT interview. Her fluency of not only policy but government was on full display. She also subtly hinted at an understanding that her bold visions would meet opposition in both parties, and that she would sometimes have to settle for incremental advances. As a voter who has pragmatic expectations from a President, this was reassuring to hear.
I'm less worried about the Senate holding things up, because look at Trump.  He just makes laws and they go into effect, by passing the House and the Senate.   Forget  the term, not executive privilege.   Can see her or Bernie on day one just signing a stack of laws they pre-wrote.
I'm really hoping that the wild swing from Obama to Trump will be equally matched by a wild swing in the other direction to Warren. Overcorrecting from the corruption of Trump could potentially be the only thing that sets us on a positive path forward to repeal Citizens United and get nationwide election security and voter enfranchisement legislation passed so everyone's votes are counted.
> "My first choice is a strong consumer agency," the Harvard Law professor and federal bailout watchdog said in an interview with the Huffington Post. "My second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor."
never thought of that. that's probably most of it. sigh.

Thank you that's the one.
I am still miffed about Florida.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveils plan to end offshore drilling, protect marine ecosystems and wildlife
Bernie is my #1 but this really increases my excitement for Warren as a close #2. I really respect that she is bringing salience to the biodiversity crisis that plays into climate change and will create a whole lot of human and ecological suffering of its own. I hope folks realize that this is a kitchen table issue as much as any other because of how dependent communities are on the sea and marine life. Like climate change has become a justice issue, I am glad she is doing the same with other forms of ecosystem damage. Julian Castro also tried to bring biodiversity into the conversation. Hope our eventual nominee takes this seriously.
Glad she's holding strong on this issue. Has Warren released an infrastructure plan?
I'd love to see more of this sort of thing this year.  Let's turn this in a race to save the oceans
I love this plan, especially after seeing her answer [this question](https://youtu.be/yfsFweL2T5c?t=9222) at the CNN Climate Town Hall
I like this a lot.  A while ago I got spooked about ocean acidification and decided that would be my go-to question if I ever got the chance (I've since switched it to something else), but you know that was the first thing I searched this plan for.

Is there a wrong time to do the right thing?
The sooner the better.
Why do you say that?
Respectfully, would you mind explaining why this is the wrong time? I think she‚Äôs been on a roll lately, and this is good for reminding everyone why they fell in love w her originally‚Äîthe policy wonkness.

Is she going to take a selfie with everyone???

I know we all like her and are maybe biased, but I feel like she has had non-stop momentum for the last two months, and she hasn‚Äôt even tapped into the jet fuel instant support of going hard after trump.
She's going to win. #WARREN2020

Get it, Liz.
Damn, girl! Love seeing this enthusiasm for her.
These are presidential numbers.
people didn't believe me when i said she has a great working class union message, it easily can be extended to working class poc. [comment not specific to this crowd but general midwest]   biden should be nervous about this.
IT WAS AMAZING!! I'm currently in a huge line for a selfie but it will be so worth it üòÇ
Goddamn. I remember when she was pulling in like a hundred on a visit to Springfield.
So upset that I got sick last night and in to today. I hope she makes it back!
Apparently there was an ['Eat the rich!'](https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/1163606181069373441?s=19) chant, which if true is amazing.
I wanted to go so bad.
No empty seats!
I would occasionally look around the crowd and just not believe I was there. She was so great!
When Warren says Dream Big we say Fight Hard
Wow
Amazing!!! This campaign is a movement!!!
Did she beat Elton Johns record?

Still waiting in line! They say they do 6 selfies a minute.  I don't have to work tomorrow.  It's worth the wait
YES. Persist!
She took a photo with anyone who wanted to.  I waited over 2.5 hours for mine and there was a good chunk of line behind me.  I bet she was doing it for about 3 hours.  That's pretty amazing.
Her [speech](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=385498618816704&id=86680728811&_rdr)  was so inspiring. So ready for this fight.
Yea her stock is definitely rising. I think it's a combination of her message and policies resonating with people and the appeal of Biden wearing off (he was instantly the front runner after announcing his bid but the general population is finally realizing he's not Obama).  She's far from a shoo in yet but I'm hopeful, excited, and cautiously optomistic.
No it's not just you.   I'm a Yang supporter... Tacitly waiting for Warren to shoot up so I can push her over the line.   Warren has gravitas. Shes got a plan. She's got a message. She polls well, especially considering far less name recognition than Biden and Sanders, which I believe is the reason they're slightly ahead in head-to-head's against Trump.  She's gonna take it all the way.
Win the Dem position or the Presidency?  Because I am not sure a woman can win against Trump, unfortunately.
RemindMe! 15 months
Almost half as many as Trump!
I was there, pretty close to the stage, I heard no such thing.
Nooo, biomagnification is a real concern! Compost the rich. ‚ôªÔ∏è
I jus ate but if they was smother in jelly an raisns or I could burp i can eat a rich man lol
One Change Research poll in June showed her at first place by one point, but that's about it.
Your Yang Gang trolling is obvious, dude. Cut it out.
Ok to be fair it‚Äôs Minnesota
I don't know that she has 2000 minutes (1 day 9 hours 20 minutes) to work with.
I'm still trying to justify not waiting in line tonight. :(
I‚Äôm still in line at 9:37 PM, haha, been here since 3 checking people into the rally. Worth it.
6 is pretty solid.
She‚Äôs so crazy. I love it.
I think another dynamic of Biden is realizing that he is slipping.  He‚Äôs just not 100% there.
Another Yang supporter here. Fully agree with you, I‚Äôd be very excited if Warren was the nominee. She seems more relatable than Biden especially and even Bernie in a lot of ways. She also has a better message I think than both of them with a lot of policies to back it up.   I think for me personally ranking the nine candidates qualified for the next debate it would be 1. Yang 2. Warren 3. Bernie 4. Beto 5. Booker 6. Buttigeig 7. Biden 8. Harris 9. Klobuchar
A woman already won against Trump.

That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôve heard lmao
Same.
Yeah, same here.  I was 2 rows back and heard no chant like this.  There were several "Warren" chants and at least one "2 cents".
Also the whitest zip code in the tein cities, iirc
I know, me too. But the way people were just pushing into the "line"....I stood there a long time withiit ever moving and I got over there pretty fast. I keep saying next time but by next time the crowds will be even bigger.  Still exciting to see!
Yeah, I wanted to wait in line but I have a 7 AM meeting this morning and was already tired, but wonder if I'll regret not doing the selfie!
So did you get it?
And Biden at 100% is still like 92% to be fair.
I heard it put really well. Biden is the tautology candidate. He does well in polls because he is seen as the safe candidate because he does well in polls.  If something shakes that, his support will crater.
Yeah, agree. I'm probaby 1. Yang 2. Warren 3. Bernie 4. Harris 5. Klobuchar 6. Buttigieg 7. Booker 8. Beto 9. Biden
Touch√©!
I hate this bot, but imagining it reminding this The_Donald poster next year that Elizabeth Warren just won the election makes it all worthwhile.
A chant of ‚Äú2 cents‚Äù did break out
That's what I'm doing too. Reading these hours later and wondering if everyone got their selfie.
I did!
The more I hear about Yang, the more I like him.  I would love it if he tries for the presidency again. For now, I am still a Warren supporter, but since he is only 44, I would love to see him in 8 years.   I think he would be an amazing follow up to Warren. UBI needs to come after we fix our healthcare system and get drugs/addiction out if the criminal justice system and into the healthcare system. I think he could do wonders with a post-Warren presidency.
Well all things considered Trump is undeniably more likely to win than Warren. He only has to win the general, whereas Warren has to win a primary that includes Bernie Sanders, who‚Äôll split the progressive vote with her, and Biden, who‚Äôll take the moderate/conservative vote from her without much opposition. Since there will likely be a contested convention due to the sheer number of candidates, Biden probably win once the delegates are no longer pledged since he‚Äôs the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù candidate. Biden likely isn‚Äôt the Democrats‚Äô best bet, as he does have a fair amount of baggage, and just generally seems like he could be Hillary 2.0.
She was there til after 10 and was still greeting everyone energetically and with a smile.
I got mine,  I finally left at about 10 pm.
Same. I debated leaving at 8:30 because I was already tired and hungry, but when I didn't leave then figured I might as well stay as long as it takes.
Elizabeth meeting Tex yesterday. My new favorite photo ever.
Now I just wish we had a photo from the opposite angle where Tex has the same expression on his face and his paws are raised up.
I am READY for a wholesome DankWarrenMeme from this photo. It's so precious!!
Liz is so adorable. I love her love for dogs:)
This is quite literally amazing. Can we make this go viral?
who or what is tex
Is Tex a baby? A dog? A cat?
Beautiful!  This made me so happy!  Thanks for posting it!
I would love to see a photo of this from the side! Show a cute dog pic pls!
How do people not see how genuine she is? This picture makes me soooo happy. Sadly Trump's hostility has infected people far beyond his supporters. Her message of hope and positivity aren't just words, it seems to be just who she is. She's a beacon of light in the darkness!
OMG. I need her to be my president ‚ù£Ô∏è
Warren has the energy of your dog when you just get home from work!
Ok so I‚Äôll post the photo of us in another post. His head tilt is hilarious and she does a pinky promise with him too.
My god üòäüò≠ tiny puppy paws in the air make my heart melt
Spread the love! This photo needs to be shown to the world
Please?!
You can't make something go viral. It will or it won't. This won't

I posted it to my FB

I‚Äôll post it there also.
From your entire mod crew, THANK YOU. Politics isn't ever easy, but you all make it so, so, so worth it. Happy Thanksgiving. Get some rest and get ready for the final sprint. 67 days until the Iowa Caucuses ‚Äî we can do this!
I know people are disheartened by recent polls, but those things bounce around, and most of us are here because we know we've got an amazing candidate in Liz. Forward looking, team building, energizing, she will endure.   She's no flavor of the month, she didn't peak too early, she's playing a long game. Things will get interesting when the debates are narrowed down to a more reasonable number and the early states come into play.
Warren isn‚Äôt my top choice, but her supporters seem to be one of the few groups that truly have the best interest of the country at heart. I‚Äôve had many civil discussions with people here, something that I can not say has happened on the Bernie sub. However this primary process ends up, just wanna say thank you for being civil.
I'm a stalwart supporter and donor in New Orleans, LA (very red state). I've been all about Senator Warren since she first interviewed with Jon Stewart during the recession.  She is the change we need now. She is capable and courageous enough to take on the inceasingly tilted economic policies of multiple, party-differentiated special interests that will ultimately lead our country to ruin in our grandkid's time.  I'm not a plant. Look at my reddit posts. I support senator Warren because I truly believe she represents and will serve for the best of America.
Happy Thanksgiving, all! I wish you luck in pushing back against the crazy uncles at the dinner table =)

I wonder what it says that Bernie‚Äôs name comes up almost every time Warren‚Äôs does.  That said, I would focus less on supporters and more on actual policy.
Agreed! Thanks for being in the fight. If you want, send us your donor receipt (remove personal info) and you can get a donor flair.
He‚Äôs very outspoken about his beliefs, and he tries to brand himself as the progressive pioneer, that‚Äôs why.   Regarding policy exclusively, i‚Äôd prefer Warren any day of the year to Bernie.
Warren Takes Top Spot in The Root's "Every Democratic Candidates' 'Black Agenda', Ranked"
Well, THAT's not gonna get any traction on r politics. Bernie is 5th. What other subs should we share this with?
 There you have it. Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs ‚Äúblack agenda‚Äù is the blackest of them all. Unfortunately, she also seems to be invisible to everyone except Mike Bloomberg. **But that‚Äôs only because she keeps punching him in the face during the debates.**
They should make an ad that shows how she tops like every other scorecard
What I wanna know is why Pete is ranked so high
This is the last thing that put me into the Warren camp (That an an analysis of her positions and voting record that says she is the most progressive of the candidates).     So I'm going to donate and canvass this weekend (I'm in California)
How is tom steyer so low. His campaign is built arpund reparations for slavery and giving govt grants to HBCUs.
I can see why she tops this list, but ... Biden #2 and Buttigieg #3?  GTFOOH!!!!!
UNSURPRISING!
[removed]
I'm currently getting down voted over there for saying that I changed my registration to Democrat to early vote for Warren.  That sub has gone full cult status.
I just posted it to /r/Democrats2020
Twitter, Facebook... share everywhere!
r political discussion
Post it on the Buttigieg sub. For real,  that's a pretty good rating from one of the most woke writers in America.
The wording in that first sentence is...not great my friend.
I don‚Äôt usually say this but holy fuck was that article bad.   There is a difference between laying out the facts and then offering your opinion on them...or straight up letting your bias dominant the story.   Also, Dude is a self proclaimed ‚Äúwypipologist‚Äù; that a quick [google search](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/wypipologist/) tells me is: someone who studies white people and can explain the crazy things they do.
frankly i can't recall a scorecard she *hasn't* topped.
I mean, you can read their methodology.
Because five candidates were worse. 66 out of 100 isn't exactly bragging rights.
Because these ranks are ridiculous. Warren's probably the best on racial justice, but Biden at second? Ridiculous.
The ranking is a mixture of Pete getting high scores for having actual good plans and low scores because Michael Harriot doesn‚Äôt like Pete Buttigieg/Pete is not a legislator.
Because it's based on plans and policies, not tweets from random people
The Power rankings change weekly depending on what a candidate did or did not do that week.
He probably hired a great consultant to develop the plan to make himself more appealing to black voters. We all know it‚Äôs his weak spot...
Canvassing for Warren this weekend in California as well, down south. Good luck, LFG!!
Yay!  Thanks!
Dunno, though possibly the idea of an old rich white guy waving free cash handouts at the black community and expecting them to go nuts for it doesn‚Äôt quite come across as nobly as he would have expected ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?
It is way too early for a delegate winning candidate to drop (no matter what you think about what's happening).  Not down voting since I understand your point, but it's just not right yet.  The true power of any support any losing candidate brings to beating trump will be by how well they lead their supporters to get behind the winning candidate.  Warren's chances seem slim right now, but it would be silly for her to drop any earlier than next week.   As much as you think your comment is coming from a place of logic, it is coming from passion for your candidate (and fear of Trump or another candidate winning).
This was only hard to read because it made no sense. I'll shift my support when he wins the nomination. I fail to see how supporting the candidate I feel strongest about during primaries results in... what? Sanders losing in the general? What on Earth are you even talking about?  The whole point of the primaries is to vote your preferred candidate, vote blue no matter who is for the general election.
Well, I say you're awesome. :)
This happened in 2016 with Clinton vs Sanders too.
Also, #primarywarren is trending on Twitter.  If you need anymore evidence that they are Trump like, there you have it.  (I don't mean in terms of policies, but in terms of tactics)
I got down voted to hell for, and I kid you not, contemplating that if Bernie were president, then Warren should replace Schumer as senate majority leader.  They are so damn peevish that they can't even respect Warren enough to acknowledge that she would be a great senate majority leader.
Well have an upvote from me üíö
Actual comment I saw there today:  > Really getting sad how warren supporters keep defending their choice. It‚Äôs like they want trump.
That is most of reddit honestly.
Really? Because I see alot of pro warren talk over there, at least since Bernie took a solid lead. It's a pro-warren sub, just not as much as it's a pro-bernie sub.
I looks like they deleted it and reposted with a neutral headline.
I did not know that existed.  r/PoliticalDiscussion is also a sub not overtaken completely by Bernie obsessive followers.  They actually had a pretty normal discussion about Warren staying in until the convention.
Is that the new voteblue? I got banned for voteblue by jokingly saying we should primary the mods. Thought it was funny. Apparently not. Need my dem comradery fix back.
Sounds like another sub I'd get banned from for keeping it real.
My bad. It looks like that‚Äôs your posting.
This is a quote from the article.
It's a direct quote from the linked article.
"there you have it"?
The Root is not a serious journalism outlet in the mainstream sense. They‚Äôre a Gawker-like outlet (owned by the company that owns for former Gawker sites). It‚Äôs going to be over the top and opinionated. The goal of sites like that isn‚Äôt objective analysis for the average reader. These types of sites are targeted at specific audiences who already share a point of view. It‚Äôs part satire/humor, part activism, loosely based on journalistic practices.
didn't seem that biased to me. i mean it would've been easy to give bloomberg all 0s just because of stop & frisk or "redlining was actually good" or him trying to buy the presidency, but they gave him pretty high marks for economics, education, even criminal justice (despite stop & frisk). do you disagree that warren's black agenda is the most comprehensive & actionable?
I read the methodology and read the reasons they gave for biden and it really did not seem convincing at all.
They had reasons. You may disagree, but it would be more effective to say why based on the policies, plans, histories etc. rather than your gut feeling about a candidate.
Are you questioning their metrics?   They explain their conclusions based on a number of points; what is it you disagree with? (genuinely curious)
Before that it was Ron Paul.  The sub always goes full cult in Presidential election years.
Fucking Christ, why?
that's rather hilarious because she's not up for re-election until 2024. that was, i suspect, a large part of the reason she chose not to run in 2016 (on top of being still very new to holding public office and probably not wanting to step on hillary's toes, bless). if she had run & lost, or even if she had won, she would have to worry about her seat being taken by a republican - just as she took it *from* a republican. she opted to secure her re-election, and run in a year when if the bottom fell out, she'd still have 4 years in the senate to put the pieces back together and save her seat. in this political cycle, absolutely nobody is going to remember #primarywarren when it's actually time to primary her, lol.
She would! I can't help feeling, though, that if she were not President (which she will be, dammit) that she'd be an incredible Secretary of the Treasury. Who better to be in charge of the country's economy?  BUT let's focus on getting her elected President :)
Do you mean the comment that has ~20 points and people either agreeing with you, preferring her as VP, or complaining that you don't support her for president?
I'll take your word for it. I see very few Warren articles over there, but that's just me.
It‚Äôs 100% a pro Bernie sub now. All the top articles are from jacobin or commondreams praising him. You get downvoted, dog piled or even suspended for not being on that team.
/r/Democrats2020 is solely about the presidential primary.
you mean besides r/democrats?
Yeah, I gave it a neutral headline because I kind of figured it wouldn't get much traction if it had the same headline as this.
context is everything! my bad
Better Biden than Pete.  Though that is like picking between a broken leg or a root canal.
Biden is getting so much credit for Obama's work. A 10 for feasibility? Yeah it's easy for your plans to be feasible when they don't do anything. He gets 8 points for just being Obama's VP, when other candidates have done much more to talk about black lives other than just constantly referencing Obama.
[removed]
oh my god I forgot about Ron Paul.   they‚Äôre in favor of white male (social) libertarian populism first and foremost, it seems.
Because if a woman is going to seek power at the detriment of a particular man; she shall be punished accordingly.  It's called a backlash.  The only value women have according to the supporters of this particular candidate is loyalty to a man.
Because they have been demanding she drop out since before Iowa so that ‚Äúbernie can have all her voters and delegates‚Äù. Apparently it‚Äôs Warren‚Äôs fault that bernie hasn‚Äôt already won.
[https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/02/27/elizabeth-warren-superdelegates](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/02/27/elizabeth-warren-superdelegates)
No.
fiddlesticks
but that's easy, i get drugs with a root canal and i'm better by the end of the day...
"Biden worked for a black boss and, as veep, he was surrounded by black people who were smarter than him (Susan Rice, Michelle Obama, Eric Holder, Jeh Johnson). This might not seem like much, but eight years listening to black people is something few white people have ever done."  Not saying I agree with how strongly the author weighted that, but it is a good point and unique experience that none of the other candidates have.
Well they give him points for actually working with and listening to Black people in office which is more than fair. I don't like Biden, and 10 for that is maybe a little high but I don't see why endless "talk about black lives" should matter more than experience working under intelligent, important Black people
> Yeah it's easy for your plans to be feasible when they don't do anything.  reminds me so much of the SNL warren town hall. "my plan differs from his in that it exists. no one asks how we're gonna pay for 'remember obama?'"  i'm a little annoyed with giving biden so much credit for... standing next to the first black president, basically, but there's some pretty deep cynicism in the black electorate such that they mostly expect to get dicked over no matter who wins, and they're just trying to hedge their bets on whoever the white people will back to get trump out of office. which is why you're starting to see biden's black support drop and bernie's rise, but warren's isn't really budging.
I mean.. Yes? Promising things you could never hope to deliver is how you lose points in the feasibility category, specifically. That's literally what it's supposed to measure.
Look, I understand your passion but Idk why you wrote a thesis on the merits of Sanders' plans; this is way too long and I'm not really interested in a defense of Sanders, for a few reasons:  * This is the Warren sub. If I were interested in Sanders, I'd look at literally any other sub that involves politics, which his supporters have taken over * I don't work at *The Root*, so I have no idea what-all went into their metrics though I imagine it involved some details * I'm also not African American, so I can't speak from their perspective on the candidates and whether *they* believe their platforms can be accomplished.  That aside, this point?  > I will again reiterate that while I think his stated platform is 2nd only to warren in terms of criminal and racial justice, that's coming primarily from his staff  Let's just stop right there: he's running for president. **He** owns his platform, not his staff. And if his platform has any weaknesses due to that staff?   That means he's not as effective a leader on those issues. If he surrounds himself with questionable advice and leadership--which it's evident he does--and takes that advice, then that *also* speaks to his questionable judgement.  Personally, he can talk until the cows come home but it's Warren who's actually gotten shit done for everyday Americans; I'm voting for her.
[deleted]
Very true, but is it backlash over any one specific thing, or just because they think she spoke ill of Socialist Jesus?
What they don't realize is that if she drops Bernie is going to be the lone one on the debate stage. At least with Warren there he's got an ally for progressivism
It's about superdelegates? Even though Socialist Jesus wanted them to straight-up reverse the majority popular vote in 2016?  I don't want to live on this planet anymore...
I deeply love this response
[removed]
I didn‚Äôt say there wasn‚Äôt a better option of the two.
i think my issue is less with how they weighed it and more with the assumption that just because he was surrounded by them meant he listened to them. i wouldn't think someone who spent 8 years actually listening to black people would have said that segregationists were nice because "they never called ME 'boy'."
Because Biden was in large part chosen for his *acceptability* to the white moderate, while Obama courted the nascent progressive movement.   I see little reason to believe that Biden's tenure as VP has somehow endowed him with a special kind of wisdom that makes him a good candidate for people of color, let alone 10 points of "intentionality"
Right. That's why I have a problem with the measure. It's easy to score high there by setting the bar at the floor.
Sorry, you said you were genuinely curious about what issues someone could have with their ranking and I gave my reasons.  It wasn't intended to convince you to vote for sanders, and I even concluded at the end that Warren was better.  >He owns his platform, not his staff. And if his platform has any weaknesses due to that staff?  >That means he's not as effective a leader on those issues. If he surrounds himself with questionable advice and leadership--which it's evident he does--and takes that advice, then that also speaks to his questionable judgement.  I think you're misunderstanding what I'm trying to say here.  My argument was not that he is good and it's his staff's fault that his plans are bad, it was the opposite- that his plans are actually quite good but it's primarily a result of him having good staff, while he himself leaves things to be desired and would never have come up with something this good on his own when it comes to race, a topic he isn't super comfortable discussing.
Go away Chapo troll   https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2013/02/18/rand_paul_calls_for_new_populist_libertarianism_117057.html  https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2013/11/05/unpopular-and-impolitic  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism
It's backlash over running against Bernie; apparently he "entitled" to all the progressive vote.  When the argument could be made that maybe a 78 year old man should move over and back a younger progressive woman.  But that's blasphemy apparently.
i am frankly disappointed to see such transparent self-serving from bernie in the form of his "superdelegates are good if they give me the nomination, but bad if they give the nomination to someone else," not to mention the fact that his supporters buy into it wholecloth.
[removed]
no, i am. i am saying that a root canal is definitely better than a broken leg.
Why he was picked doesn't detract from the fact that he worked with them for 8 years.  They didn't say a special kind; just more, or better than most white people. The 10 is obviously relative to the field
It's almost like marginalized people care about the probability that things will actually get better more than they care about who has the best ideals.
> Sorry, you said you were genuinely curious about what issues someone could have with their ranking and I gave my reasons.   Ok, fair; I wasn't clear enough. I was responding to someone suggesting Biden shouldn't be as high; I was trying to get at what issues they had with Biden's results. Of course, anyone can take issue with any of them, but I didn't intend that conversation here.  > My argument was not that he is good and it's his staff's fault that his plans are bad, it was the opposite- that his plans are actually quite good but it's primarily a result of him having good staff, while he himself leaves things to be desired and would never have come up with something this good on his own when it comes to race, a topic he isn't super comfortable discussing.  Ah, I see. Because you wrote "second only to", and the part about his staff, I assumed you meant they were responsible for him being second; it wasn't at all clear you meant it the other way (thanks for the clarification).   Ok, thanks for following up.
**Libertarian socialism**  Libertarian socialism, also referred to as anarcho-socialism, anarchist socialism, free socialism, stateless socialism, socialist anarchism and socialist libertarianism, is a set of anti-authoritarian, anti-statist and libertarian political philosophies within the socialist movement which rejects the conception of socialism as a form where the state retains centralized control of the economy. Overlapping with anarchism and libertarianism, it criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization.Libertarian socialism often rejects the state itself and asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as citizens'/popular assemblies, cooperatives, libertarian municipalism, trade unions and workers' councils. All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary human relationships through the identification, criticism and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life.  ***  ^([ )[^(PM)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space)^( | )[^(Exclude me)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme)^( | )[^(Exclude from subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/about/banned)^( | )[^(FAQ / Information)](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)^( | )[^(Source)](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v0.28)

Isn't it specifically triggered by her showing up that Bernie supporter at the CNN Town Hall? I think that's the genesis for it, but it's hard to tell nowadays.
dude said he'd address racial injustice by having social workers teach black families how to raise their kids. i don't think he learned much of anything working with black people for 8 years.
You know that "not you" meme?
This is my favorite attribute about Warren. Being a man isn't per se disqualifying--of course--but falling into the stereotypical male trap of not showing humility and willingness to change, defer, and delegate turns me off so much. (Ofc I'm voting blue in general no matter who.)
Literally the most presidential aspect about her. It's called an "administration" - when a better plan comes along, a good administrator will recognize the plan, adopt it, and give due credit.   The fact that she has done this several times with candidates who have dropped out shows me that she would run the office without ego, looking for the best solutions rather than ones she could take credit for.
I think everyone should adopt Inslee's climate plan, like Warren did
This kind of attitude is why she‚Äôs my favorite.   She‚Äôs close to Sanders on policy, but I love her demeanor. No trying to score points based on who ‚Äúwrote the damn bill.‚Äù Just trying to get he best policies possible while, when possible, working with others and acknowledging their contributions.
Love that she is so open to listening to other perspectives and has the humility to always put good policy ideas ahead of ego. Incorporating Inslee, Harris, and Gillibrand‚Äôs ideas and giving them full credit‚Äîeven her willingness to read Yang‚Äôs book‚Äîto me this is the hallmark of a great leader, and Warren is the only candidate who consistently does this. That‚Äôs why it ticks me off to no end when Klobuchar and Buttigieg accuse her of that ‚Äúmy way or the highway‚Äù crap‚Äînothing could be further from the truth!
Her ability to create ideas worth policy position was the main reason i started admiring her back in the early 2000's when [she was describing the collapse of the middle class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A) by explaining high level economic principles in a way laymen could easily understand.  Her ability to recognize the contributions of others and adapt to superior policy, rather than reinventing the wheel is why I have high hopes for her candidacy.  History, especially recent history, makes me fear that the primary electorate would prefer a bombastic man of any quality over a near unparalleled competent woman, however.
I think this is a great quality. It's unfortunate that for so many changing your kind is seen as weakness.   But, I could also see Yang doing it and maybe Sanders.
More people need to read ‚ÄòThe Fifth Risk‚Äô by Michael Lewis. It explains another dimension of how/why Trump‚Äôs hubris endangers America.
If the KHive on twitter is to be believed she stole Kamala's plans.
Is that stereotypically male? I didn‚Äôt know.
Pretty smart move on her part
This is SUCH a great move. Way to start bringing us together Senator Warren!
I think maybe Booker would have done the same. He'd be a great vp for her
I hope this trend continues as the field narrows and get get closer to having a nominee.  The best ideas should be the ideas we move forward with as a party, and if another candidate has the best plan for that specific issue, then it should absolutely be adopted by the nominee. This is what good leadership looks like.
What if they said no? Would she just no longer believe in those things?
The Presidency is not a reward for having the best ideas, nor is it a gold watch to put at the end of a good career. It is an incredibly difficult job that can only be done well when you properly rely on experts to come up with their great ideas and you successfully bring those ideas into the real world.  Thinking and planning are big. But they are separate from administering and passing.   Warren is the best candidate to administer and pass the great ideas people have been having for decades.
She has also adopted Bernie's Medicare for All plan and he's still in the race. I think she has a different plan for how to pay for it (which she's been raked over the coals for), but the plans are the largely the same.   I like that she's willing and able to pull others' ideas into her platform. It's the best of all worlds, imo!
I agree! I love her willingness to adopt others' great ideas and bring them into her tent,  so to speak! It shows a certain intellectualism and awareness that many other politicians lack.
She did? Dang that‚Äôs awesome. What‚Äôs wild about Inslee is that he should fit the standard model for a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù pres candidate - well spoken governor who had some success in that position. Think that shows you how upside down things are - that a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù candidate drops polls so poorly.    Though you could make the case that he was too ‚Äúnorthern‚Äù, and that a more successful candidate would come from the south (a la Bill Clinton)
Yeah, he was my #2 and I was sad he was out of the race so early.
I think everybody should adopt MLK‚Äôs poverty plan of a guaranteed minimum income, like Andrew Yang did.
Bernie's "I wrote the damn bill" comment was made in response to a moderator questioning him about the specifics of Medicare for all. I never saw that as him trying to score points but just as an acknowledgement of the fact that he is well educated on the subject matter being that he is the author. I also appreciate Senator Warren's willingness to listen and implement new ideas like how she supports Medicare for all. If I'm lucky enough to have Liz or Bernie as my candidate I'll be thrilled!
I hate that this is true. Why the hell is 'flip-flopping' some toxic, political gotcha?  I can't even make up my mind what I want to eat for lunch every day!  God forbid we have a candidate be presented with new information, think critically, and change their mind to a better position. Some of us would even go as so far as to call that learning.
Had no idea how toxic the ‚ÄúKHive‚Äù was until today. It‚Äôs possible that I was just seeing a vocal minority, but they were extremely hostile to Warren for reasons I couldn‚Äôt find. Warren‚Äôs outreach to the AA community has been exceptional from what I‚Äôve seen, but they only had negative things to say about it. Most accounts were relatively new and weren‚Äôt people tho so it could be bots.
Member of K-Give (though not on Twitter. We just got upset because media ignored things that Kamala proposed from the begi, but reported on it when Warren jumped on board. I don't blame Warren for getting the press. I can still be bitter because my candidate had great ideas, but was always called a cop. As a rape and child assault provider, I knew Kamala had my back. Hopefully Warren will take more of Kamala's excellent ideas.
Not normal male, macho male.  Think of all the action heroes (especially of the 90's). They are all rebels ignoring the advice and consultation of others and solving the big problems on their own.  Police Chief: "That's it Hank! Give me your badge! You are suspended!"  Hank: "I am not suspended! I quit!"   *goes on to kill 70 people and rescue a child
Machismo is a hell of a drug.
Toxic masculinity.
If talking about negative stereotypes, yes. Is it the typical male? Probably not.
Yeah maybe Castro too.
Idk. I‚Äôm not convinced on him
She‚Äôd have developed her own plan most likely. Ofc she wouldn‚Äôt stop believing in those things; what kind of question even is that?
Look at the CFPB for a great example of her being a strong administrator. It's done a lot of good for everyday people since it started and has also proven difficult for Trump and his minions to dismantle and subvert - although it will likely need some TLC once a sane administration gets back into power.
 Luckily, her plan doesn't immediately changed the system, throwing insurance, benefits and union negotiations into chaos. She is getting closer to a public option as a bridge.
Warren's plan is laid out exactly how she plans to implement it, making it a gradual process towards complete M4A. The transition process takes aspects from Bernie's, Pete's, etc. For example: Warrens plan would cover every person from 18 and younger, 50 and up, and individuals (whole families?) that are 200% below poverty level in the first 100 days by expanding medicare coverage, and what medicare covers, including dental, vision, and hearing. Similar to Bernies plan  Warren would then implement a *temporary* "buy-in" option for people that just aren't in the age range for medicare, but could otherwise get it (Pete's plan, sorta). In combination, she will also greatly expand the ability for the ACA coverage, including a greater use of tax credits, removal of deductibles (Bernie's plan), having a max of 5% on co-payments (Pete's plan, but lower cap) and a whole bunch of other things that would just take me too long to type out on mobile : P   The main difference between Warren and Bernie's plan, is that Bernie lowers the max age by 5 each year. So by year four, he'd have people at age 50 covered, while Warren would have those same people covered in year one. Also, Bernie seems to try and get everyone else covered only when the legislation passes, while Warren would have people being able to "buy-in" into the coverage, before it becomes universal, so even if it takes a while for it to pass the in congress, people will have the ability to get the M4A coverage to some degree.
Inslee is also not an inspiring speaker and rather dull. Which is why I love him as my Governor.
My main problems with Inslee was my lack of name recognition (I did not know who he was until he was one of 20+ candidates running)   I did  not think a Climate Change only candidate could win.  We have known about the problems of the Climate Crisis for 50+ years. But we have not taken strong enough measures to combat it.   Warren's focus on fighting corruption and weakening the power of lobbyists is the first step to taking long term action against Climate Change. We don't have enough time to make 4-8 years worth of progress, then undo that progress in 4-8 years of a new administration.
You just had too many people stirring the pot for Inslee to really stand out. Same with Beto and Kamala, all three would have been really good candidates, had others like Pete, Biden, Warren, and Bernie not been in the race.
He was the one candidate who was unlikely to win who I wished had stayed in for the whole race to talk about the climatocalypse.
I think the best way to fund a UBI is with a Wealth Tax. As more and more Producer Surplus is taken by the owners of capital instead of those who work for wages, the more needed a UBI will become.  The Wealth Tax specifically increases revenue in proportion to how necessary a UBI is. As more and more capital is focused on fewer and fewer people, the more a Wealth Tax will bring in.  It is the policy Yang should really have.
> Bernie's "I wrote the damn bill" comment was made in response to a moderator questioning him about the specifics of Medicare for all  The FIRST time it was.  He has said it in every debate since, too. None of them to this same context.   I don't think he is being a bad person. He just got a really good reaction to the line, and some pollster is probably telling him "Be sure to say the line! It goes really well with your base!"
I thought it was in response to Tim Ryan saying something along the lines of "You don't know what it would cover" on the debate stage.
I think they‚Äôre responding more to the typical attitude of someone who supports a candidate: ‚ÄúBernie freaking wrote it of course he‚Äôs better‚Äù Bernie-or-bust type toxic attitude.      Bernie‚Äôs comment was fair, it‚Äôs also not supposed to be seen as some kind of unbeatable comeback.
> 'flip-flopping' some toxic, political gotcha?  Unfortunately it is a complex question.   On the one hand, you have your point. We absolutely want politicians who look at new information, think critically, and change their minds.   On the other hand, you DON'T want politicians who got elected on a specific promise, to then just not even attempt to fulfill that promise.   Any politician that has my vote is a politician that knows the dire consequences of not acting on Climate Change. I would be beyond upset if I voted for someone, they won, then they declared the Climate Crisis a "Chinese Hoax."
I missed them because I spend more time on reddit & FB but when I started to use twitter more the last month volunteering I realized that they're as bad if not worse than Red Rose/BernieBro Twitter.
I mean in a general sense the platforms are probably 60-80% the same between candidates and Warren even attributed Kamala and Booker for the Black Maternity plan and just added something to it.
It may not be the typical male, but it certainly fits the typical male politician. I cant even remember the last time one of them asked for permission for any policy.
Then why ask for permission at all? Just develop your own
It's all theoretical at this point anyway. A plan by a candidate and what might actually pass will be two different things. People were aghast when she wouldn't say what her plan was yet, then they were aghast when she did say her plan - exactly like the Native American/DNA aghast-ness. The press likes setting her up for no win situations.
Which personally I think is the wisest policy for the Dems to take into the general election. I'm from the midwest, and while this is anecdotal, I'm legit terrified that the GOP machine will make M4A a losing issue here.
Interesting. I actually loved him as an orator, but then again I‚Äôm pretty dull hehe
I think we would all be better off if we didn't need to be inspired every 4 years and just voted in the best interests for our future and judged people based on their track records and not their pretty words.
Economists disagree.
You are correct and I do believe the line is being used again after the initial reaction was so positive. I don't think he is wrong to use it to satisfy his base and speak to his supporters though, that's just part of American politics. Look at any of the number of chants that Trump incites at his "rallies" or "Yes we can" from the Obama campaign for example.
Haven‚Äôt had any KHive-ers in my face but I have had Bernie Bros and they were definitely not Russian internet trolls either. I am more worried about their support if Bernie doesn‚Äôt win than I am worried about Trump voters.
Obviously because it‚Äôs easier, more expedient, and because sometimes other people have good ideas. You‚Äôre clearly just here to use your alt account be antagonistic.
She‚Äôs building a coalition, nitwit. We need everyone on board to solve the big problems. She‚Äôs one person and shouldn‚Äôt waste time inventing the wheel if she‚Äôs got other perfectly good wheels to work off of
I don't disagree. Inslee was my first choice when he was still running. I just also recognize there are voters that do like a great communicator as President.
I am actually an Econ Master's student. From what I can tell, her plans dodge the historical problems with wealth taxes.  Leonardo DaVinci had drawings of flying machines that never worked until the Wright brothers built there's. Where would the world be had we all decided flight was impossible because it had not worked in the past?  I don't think passing a Wealth tax will be easy. I don't think administering one will be easy either.  But I think it is worth doing things, even when they are hard.
Politicians gotta politic. You are right about that.  I just think u/Amber-fool is right when they say:  >Not trying to score points based on who ‚Äúwrote the damn bill.‚Äù  and you are right when you say:  > I don't think he is wrong to use it ["I wrote the damn bill"] to satisfy his base and speak to his supporters   I think you both see it the exact same way, you just have different reactions to it. Which is totally normal. Two people will typically react different to the same stimulus.
This is my main account. I‚Äôm not trying to be antagonistic, I just don‚Äôt see it as that big a deal
I get that but she also has no quarrel with coming up with her own plans regardless of someone else has a similar one, so why is this one different?
How do her wealth tax plans dodge the historical problems?
To show that we are all in this together? To not waste campaign money on rewriting policies? To win support from those candidates‚Äô camps? To give credit where due?       Do you think no one would say anything if she released a plan that‚Äôs very similar to her former opponent‚Äôs plan? No; people would accuse her of ideological theft. Asking permission and then integrating it with her own ideas is the smart AND proper thing to do.
One of the biggest things is that it does not start until $50 million. Meaning there are FAR fewer people you have to deal with. Way lower administrative burden.  Another really big one is that more than two thirds of wealth is held in financial assets like Stocks, bonds, closely held businesses, retirement accounts etc. Once you add real estate and you have the vast majority of all wealth in accounts you can't hide your ownership of.  All the squabbling is on the last 20% of the wealth. Questions of Art, fancy cloths, and wine. Even if we do a piss poor job of accounting for these items, you still get +80% of the wealth accounted for.  "Won't they then start hoarding art to avoid the tax?"  Two major answers.  One: If they try and avoid the tax through any loophole. We can pass new legislation to close that loophole. Fixing problems with our tax code is NOT a new thing. We have been fixing problems with the way we currently do taxes from the very beginning.  Two: if you hoard a ton of wealth in the form of art, all you have done is given a lot of money to artests with the hope that someone will be willing to buy your art when you need cash. It is basically giving away your money to artests in hopes that a different rich person will be willing to give away their money to you later.
No one accused her of ideological theft when she took on the mantle of a public option like Buttigieg Or being considered a sell out by signing onto bernies Medicare for all plan  I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôre correlating this action to togetherness or winning over the candidates camps but I do appreciate credit where it‚Äôs due, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big a deal  Listen, I‚Äôm not attacking Warren, this is just not a huge deal imo
Thanks for explaining.  It sounds like it will be costly to implement and oversee.  I‚Äôve read that the IRS said they audit poor people more often because they don‚Äôt have the resources to audit richer people.  So it sounds like another expense bloating the government (at least that‚Äôs what the Right will say, though personally I‚Äôm for increasing funding to the IRS to crack down on the rich scammers, like Trump).
For one thing I hear all the time that Warren is a ‚Äúwatered-down version of Bernie Sanders‚Äù or that she [copied him](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=12&ved=2ahUKEwj5vqXX_crmAhWjct8KHaoFDeQQFjALegQIBhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhilltv%2Frising%2F465177-panel-how-warren-copies-sanders-on-money-in-politics&usg=AOvVaw3xSV6RVu5SDcGYMhPAT7sh).        Also I‚Äôm literally just answering your questions bc you literally didn‚Äôt understand why she would ask other candidates for their plans...
>   It sounds like it will be costly to implement and oversee  Yet not more costly than the revenue it brings in.   > at least that‚Äôs what the Right will say    Well, the right is also saying that the Mueller report exonerated Trump, the Call Summery had nothing wrong in it, food stamps is socialism and is leading to a country of people looking for a hand out, and immigrants are collectively bad people. The Right saying things is just not enough of a reason to avoid good policy.  Do you think the rich has been avoiding their fair share of taxes? Either through advocating for low taxes on their major form of income (capital gains), pushing loopholes and deductions that benefit them over most people (Everything is a business expense if you have a creative enough accountant), or through literally breaking the law (you are right, we have not been persecuting white collar crimes at the proper levels for decades).  You can't fix that through improving our current tax system. If we ended every single tax loophole and tax benefit for the rich tomorrow, it would not fix the problem. That money has gotten through all of those taxes and is now counted as their wealth.   Only a Wealth Tax can fix the history of bad tax codes.   Their wealth only exists because it resides in a country that is stable, healthy, and functioning. Taxing them to ensure the continued health, stability, and functionality of that system isn't even bad for them.
Hey Warren people! I come from the Beto sub (in peace) with something to share concerning the two candidates and their Trump comments.
I agree with this message. Very smart. Thanks for the cordiality. I love the way Beto has run his campaign, wish him and his supporters the best of luck! Only love from the Warren camp
I‚Äôve seen multiple interviews in which Warren is asked to respond to candidate X‚Äôs stance on issue Y and She. Will. Not. Bite. She simply reiterates that she is here to discuss her policies, not criticize other candidates. Every volunteer I know (with one exception) tries to follow her lead on this.   When a Beto supporter stops by my table we talk about Beto‚Äôs strengths and I have nothing but good to say about him. (This is sincere.) My Warren tshirt and buttons and stack of campaign literature clearly express my preference, I don‚Äôt need to insist that she is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than Beto. We listen to one another; if he still prefers Beto he should continue to support Beto, but either way if he goes away feeling more positively about Warren I‚Äôve done my job.   People are responding positively to the cordiality and respect that Warren and Sanders are showing one another despite the media attempt to start a left war. They are teammates, not rivals. The media needs a horse race, so the narrative is moving to trying to split the left from the centrists. This impacts Harris, Buttigieg, Beto, and other candidates not at the ends of the spectrum who are pushed to pick a side. Several candidates on the debate stage reminded the audience (both nights) that everyone on the stage has a better stance than the republicans. With actual voting still 6 months away it is important to not do trumps work for him by weakening the other dems.
>Don‚Äôt bite.  Right on! I agree. It is a little crazy to realize sometimes that the person arguing with you is doing so with orders essentially from Putin. The work we are doing enrages a global tyrant enough to spend millions of hours and rubles trying to stop us and derail us. Do not stop. Do not let yourself be derailed. If the conversation devolves, let them yell into the abyss, and walk away. They only have power if you let them.
Appreciate your reaching out, brother! I too hope we all can stay united against right-wing propaganda, Russian interference, and Drumpf's awfulness.   We need to focus on what we agree on, here on the left. Every candidate wants universal healthcare, every candidate wants a more fair and humane immigration system, every candidate wants corruption in Washington to end, etc. We need to keep at the forefront of our minds the fact that we all want the same things, but may simply have different ideas of how to get there.   Here on the left, we usually strive to educate each other, rather than shout each other down, and we sympathize with others, rather than rationalize away our cognitive dissonance. That's what makes us strong. Let's all internalize that fact, and go win an election from Drumpf and the Russians!
Great message. Warren is my current favorite, but I'd vote for Beto in a heartbeat if he gets the nod.
This is exactly right. Political messages‚Äîin this case Trump's racism and his truly un-American words and actions‚Äîdon't get across just by being right. They require constant repetition. So it's important for all candidates, and their supporters, to stay on message and not get scared of the bots or of the concern trolls who will be saying that we should just stick to health care or other pocketbook issues. The more candidates that are on this, the better, and I'll defend any who are, even those I don't otherwise favor (Biden, for instance).
Great post, no reason to attack a fellow democrat pushing for change. There are times when you have to step away from the minutia and infighting and present a united front. This is one of those times.
I am a huge fan of Beto and loved his Senate run and how he speaks so clearly and honestly. Unfortunately for him, I just REALLY LOVE warren and REALLY want a woman President this time so he fell down the list.   But I am very supportive of his message and how he is campaigning and if we have to have a white man presidency again, he would be my pick.   Thank you and I hope Beto stays a public figure for a long time one way or another! üëè
It's been really nice to see the old Beto back this last week. I hope he keeps it up! Progressives need to stick up for each other now more than ever if we want to shift the Democratic party to be more in line with our values (and kick some of these closet Republicans to the curb).
it's always russian/bot, they amplify the division already in america.  Don't respond, block. Just spread message to real people. Focus on how we'll fix america.
Beto has been excellent in the aftermath and I'm sure you'll find Warren supporters are very amenable to Beto.  (He is after all who I want Warren to pick as VP, so I want him to do well enough for her to give him the nod üòâ)
Love this
Fuck yeah! Solidarity!
we will be much friendlier than the bernie subs, i promise.
Same team bro. Maybe we have different ideas of who should be team captain, but same team.
Never, ever use Trump and naked in the same sentence.   Thank you,  The Internet
Warren/O‚ÄôRourke could be a good ticket. Decent balance there in terms of age, states, gender, ideology, etc.
Question: Do you support Beto mostly because you're from Texas? If things stay the same poll-wise, who will you vote for in the primary? Still Beto, or will you choose your favorite from, say, the three most likely candidates?
We're not here to bite back, friend! I, for one, appreciate this a lot.
We have an embarrassment of riches in the primary this time, with highly capable, ethical, and brilliant figures like Sanders and Warran and Buttigeg and Beto and Castro. While I'm personally pulling for Warren, I'd be glad to vote for quite a few of the others running now, and I see the often minor differences between their policies and positions as just that: minor. I suspect quite a few Warren supporters feel the same way.   Yes, we're in the vigorous debate for the future of the party (and hopefully country) stage of the election, but that doesn't mean that we hate the other Democratic candidates, and it doesn't somehow impact the fact that we're ultimately all in this together. The enemy isn't a candidate or even, really, a voting block; the enemy is hatred, intolerance, anti-intellectualism, fascism, and private centers of power that want to keep power out of the hands of the People.
"The word ‚Äúracist‚Äù ‚Äî a charge leveled at Mr. Trump by some Democrats during the primary debate last week and again on Monday ‚Äî is interpreted by some white voters as a reflection not only on Mr. Trump but his supporters, according to some academic research.  **A 2017 study by Duke political scientist Ashley Jardina found that calling Mr. Trump or his policies ‚Äúracist‚Äù turns off some white voters. Linking the same behaviors to ‚Äúwhite supremacy,‚Äù more a reflection of Mr. Trump‚Äôs leadership, does not."**  https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/us/politics/on-politics-white-supremacy-trump.html
It seems like your evidence needs to be given to Facebook, Beto‚Äôs campaign, and the FBI.  Copy them all on each correspondence.  Do it for democracy.
Greetings! I like Beto, and really wanted him to try for another run for US Senate in Texas. Obviously, I'm rooting for Warren, but appreciate that our candidates agree on holding Trump to account. I hope you make Warren your second choice!  Edit, also, I got to see Beto in person! [Here's a picture](https://i.imgur.com/stygzgR.jpg) of him and Bernie at the Des Moines pride forum. I got some flack from my Bernie friends about that, but I think it's cool to see the candidates getting along even when they disagree on some stuff.
I think this is yet another chance to show unity. We cannot be divided over petty differences. Both candidates are responding very well, they're putting country ahead of the response from the republican hate machine
I've been really glad to see Beto showing a bit more fire in his belly right now.    I'm leaning Warren at the moment but I've got nothing but love for Beto.
> We‚Äôre VERY supportive of Elizabeth Warren‚Äôs bravery here, as calling a spade a spade is what this moment calls for and it is not politically easy.  [Hey fellow Democrat, you might want to read this article about the phrase "calling a spade a spade". Its eytomology is not racist, but its refrence in modern times is problematic.](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/09/19/224183763/is-it-racist-to-call-a-spade-a-spade) Thanks for the postive message, I like both Warren and Beto.
So the disinformation FSB bots are starting up already. And we know that the electronic voting machines are vulnerable to hacking; they almost did last time.  Maybe that's what Trump did in his 2 hour "private meeting", gave Putin codes for the swing States. I wouldn't put anything past him.  Trump actually said if a foreign government had information that there was nothing wrong with him taking it.  Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham have been especially sketchy and duplicitous. We are 16 months out. They could easily use paper ballots if that's what it takes for the most vulnerable States.
Good call, Warren has gotten hit with botnet attacks for a while now, first after she announced and again when Tulsi Gabbard announce since she‚Äôs obviously also in Putin‚Äôs pocket.  Nothing but live for Beto! Stay hyper aware and thanks for the heads up!
Absolute pure cringe
[removed]
I wish Beto would run for Senate :(
I can‚Äôt imagine how pathetic they must feel, having joined the Russian military, expecting stories they can brag about to their friends, and they spend all day on social media fellating a bigoted American fatass with the mental capacity of a three-year-old.
Right on! I love that you say educate each other too. Warren really set the tone with the inspiring policy depth her campaign is built on, and you really see an effort to live up to her standard from Beto.
I‚Äôd vote for de Blasio in a heartbeat if he gets the nod. Delaney, Williamson, some guy I‚Äôve never heard of, whatever. Once the primary is over we cannot afford to quibble over preferences.
I‚Äôm a huge fan of Warren too! As a Texan and DREAMer, I have a soft spot for our boy, but a Warren presidency is something I would love to live through too! She‚Äôs gone beyond what a top tier candidate would be obligated to say against Trump and is taking a political risk here by calling him what he is, but she‚Äôs brave for that and we damn well respect her down in Texas for how she‚Äôs fighting on this one, since it hits so close to home.
[deleted]
I fully expect Beto to be at the top of everyone‚Äôs VP list. He can deliver Texas.   California, the Northeast AND Texas? Partner, that‚Äôs the whole game. ü§†
[deleted]
God I wish we didn't have to criticize them, but yeah this comment is too true. Bernie is wonderful, but his activist base needs to rethink its strategy.
It‚Äôs not just us that they mess with huh?   Sigh...
That's a low bar LOL. Those toxic nutterbutters have driven me so far away and I'm more liberal than Sanders is...  I've even responded in kind and their mods ban you, no matter what you do, so it's not an "open discourse" thing, it's definitely just a toxic thing. Very happy with this sub tho, everyone is so non-groupthink and nice :) :) :).
Non-American Bernie supporter here, is it really that rough?
Realistically I think Beto is running for veep - the odds at this point of him catching fire and taking the prize are low, with a resume that is thin when compared to the front runners and even much of the middle tier. I really wish he (or Castro) would run for senate instead - we need him more there, and he would do more good. But yes, there‚Äôs a lot to be said for Beto or Castro in that slot - the ‚ÄúBoston-Austin‚Äù of 1960.  Though I think an old political hand with foreign policy credentials might be what she needs more, being a relative noob herself.
I like Beto a lot because his campaigns are structured with an organizer‚Äôs mentality first and foremost. He went to all 254 counties in the state, and realized that the key to winning a red state is to actually respect the scale of ground game you need to have to win over enough individuals who are swing voters, but on top of that also activate as many non voters as you can. The town halls are all a 20 minute stump speech followed by Q&A, which is all very grassroots, and I see how the policy platform changes to reflect the things that get brought up. That kind of deference to the electorate is insane, and I mean that from a logistical standpoint. There are more efficient ways to run campaigns, but he just never cares for it. The guys willing to run himself dead tired and live stream it the whole way. It‚Äôs transparency the whole way through, and that‚Äôs powerful. Policy wise, I consider it a wash between Warren and Beto. The stuff I like about Warren are things Beto doesn‚Äôt have a plan for yet, but that list keeps growing. They‚Äôre some of the only candidates out there who refuse ANY kind of large donor money (even Pete takes some). I would also rather Medicare 4 All rather than Medicare 4 America, but I‚Äôm sympathetic to the argument that we should go for a smoother transition by forcing insurance to compete with a national healthcare system to at least give them the chance to reform since it‚Äôs such a large section of the economy, even if it is built on a house of cards. Beto‚Äôs Democracy reform plan is amazing, but I‚Äôm sure Liz just hasn‚Äôt gotten to that plan yet. It doesn‚Äôt sound like anything she‚Äôd be against.   As for who I‚Äôd be voting for...i can‚Äôt vote since I‚Äôm a DREAMer. I really don‚Äôt want to base my hypothetical vote based on polls since this is such a HUGE field and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs skewing some data, but assuming it goes to a contested convention and we get to the second round and it‚Äôs clear Beto has no shot, I‚Äôd vote for Warren as a way to make sure it‚Äôs a progressive on the ticket and not Joe. Ideally it doesn‚Äôt come to that and Joes support breaks as people start to tune in. This far out it‚Äôs just us nerds paying this much attention, though.
Yikes.  It's bad and an insult to be called racist, but "white supremacy" is ok?
They have access to better bot detectors than us Plebs do. There‚Äôs a very good one called Hamilton 68 that‚Äôs currently in between iterations developed by a former FBI guy. I‚Äôm sure whatever they have hidden away is leagues better.
The "Not Me, Us" slogan should be interpreted more often to extend to the other Democratic candidates too.  I want Warren to win, but I want the other guys to come out better than ever, because they're going to be the allies and future leaders that keep the party going.
Also it was really weird how *people* overwhelming voted that she won the debate in the mega thread poll after night 2 when there were others that stood out more.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs obviously in Putin‚Äôs pocket‚Äù   What an idiotic comment. She‚Äôs in the military and is in a national security subcommittee. Show us actual evidence of being compromised by Russia or drop that thinking.
I love you too, fellow Democrat! ü§†
Losing back to back senate races in Texas could be devastating in the mission to flip Texas, and our senior senator doesn't carry the same kind of baggage as our junior.  He's a despicable snake without question, but he doesn't share Cruz's (un)liability factor for some reason.
Completely disagree, I think after this huge national profile, he should work with house members and the senate candidate to flip the state, then run for governor, where he can work to do things like fight against the heavy republican gerrymandering of the state.
I think he or Pete will make a great VP pick for Warren or Harris.
Hey man.  My three year old knows only good people who say nice things should be in charge     Give the kids a little fucking credit.
God you're so polite and thoughtful XD.   There's definitely been a version of the Niemoller poem in my head lately. "And then the trolls came for my candidate, and there was nobody left to speak for her." Let's not let that happen to our folks!
I'm a supporter of both candidates and a member of both subs. Honestly, I like Beto a lot, but I don't think he's been able to capture the media attention he needs. I think he would make an amazing VP or cabinet member though.
Literally any functioning adult.
Williamson is a real nose-holder for me.... I really don't want to elect another charlatan... But at this point I don't see how I couldn't vote for the nominee (please don't let it be her...)
I'd vote for Mitt Romney if he got the democratic nomination.
#friendship2020 is REAL!! ü§ó
It's not hard, [there are only three qualifications.](https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/requirements-for-president.html)
How are you even asking this in the year 2019.  He is not my first pick at all! Many more candidates are more qualified. However, if I have to pick from ‚Äúwhite male candidates‚Äù I would pick Beto bc he has the capacity to bring people together, would work hard, choose good people, and seems to understand the needs of the country at this time and is willing to name threats as they are.   ‚ÄúQualification‚Äù is immensely subjective and nearly meaningless at this time anyway, in my opinion. Mostly we need someone with good judgment who will work hard. Many of our current candidates hit that baseline.
How‚Äôs anyone?
I also hope he can help deliver Florida. While I love Warren, I think she probably would have a difficult time flipping this state. Of all the possible VPs, Beto probably is most likely to deliver it for her.
Yeah, I popped over to the Beto sub, and I definitely see the appeal of Warren/O'Rourke. Hopefully when Texans hear her speak, they'll hear that she's a woman from Oklahoma who worked hard and went far vs. a "Harvard elite". Combined with Beto, who still had tons of support in the Texas primary, it's promising. If only we had some choice in picking a running mate.
Ticket balancing. That's how presidential elections are frequently won in so far as that ensures the strongest turnout for the party. Successful campaigns balance out for the perceived weakness of the candidate so that the whole of the party can be enthusiastic or at the very least comfortable in voting for them.  * JFK was a young Massachusetts senator so he balanced his campaign with the veteran pol from Texas  * Reagan was a right wing radical so he balanced it with the establishment Bush Sr.  * Bush Sr. was seen as an old out of touch coastal elitist so he picked as a VP a young popular conservative from middle-america  * Bush Jr. was seen as a young dumb CEO type so he got a veteran government figure with Cheney  * Obama was a political neophyte with no foreign policy experience so he got a Washington vet with senate foreign relations cred  * Trump, the serial horndog, got a theocrat to reassure the evangelicals   As such, the optimal balance pick for the 71 year old (in 2020) progressive woman from Massachusetts would be a young relatively moderate guy from the middle of the country.  The ones who meet that description are O'Rourke, Buttigieg and Castro. And I think Beto is the best option there. Assuming he can have a good enough campaign to warrant it.  Also, I really would like an at least 16 year run of White House control and having a VP who could follow her up in 2028 would be nice and probably be the best way to maximize the chances of that.
As a dedicated Bernie supporter (who would be absolutely delighted to have Warren as our candidate) threads like this make me wish I participated more in the dialogue and weren't so averse to online activism. The on-the-ground pro-Bernie communities I've participated in have been high quality activists, with obvious room for improvement. Unfortunately, I think the toxic and insidious nature of the behaviors y'all have outlined really blossom in online communities. I'm mostly a lurker on reddit. We need to do better to stifle that culture, especially given foreign influence working to divide. We need a collective win.
I‚Äôm honestly a little shocked tbh. I figured if any of the candidate subs had a good relationship with them it would be y‚Äôall given you‚Äôre the two super big reformers. I guess it‚Äôs Bernie or Bust still over there, but hey, at least enough of us will come together at the end of the day.
He has inspired a cult of personality, like Trump has. Some of his supporters take any criticism of Bernie as a criticism of themselves and they lash out. He has a great message but his supporters are a hive of toxicity and it sucks.
not going to talk too much shit, but a friend used to be a bernie supporter, is now supporting warren and got a call from our revolution. And let's just say her response triggered the our revolution rep into a tirade. Very unprofessional and def turned me off.  Needs to be said that Our Revolution isn't officially affiliated with campaign but yeah it's not a good look.
Ya I voted for him in 2016 but his base is basically a cult now, and nothing is better proof of that than how they attack warren consistently. Bernie would never do that, just his fans.
[deleted]
like anywhere else, the loudest are the worst, the overwhelming majority are good people who get drowned out by the loud toxic ones
WayOfTheBern is basically it personified, but it bleeds into more mainstream subs and gets only sporadic pushback from the less toxic supporters.  *Edit: Note that it's pretty likely WotB has all sorts of active influence campaigns going on by Trump supporters and Russia.  Posters there are not necessarily Bernie supporters at all.*
Thanks for the comprehensive answer!
Keep encouraging the people in your community that can to vote!  I've heard that there's some concern among legal citizens with undocumented friends and relatives that voting could in some way endanger their families.  If we can overcome that sentiment, a bluer Texas that actually represents all of its people could come sooner than we think.
Sure, but they may need a push to look at a particular issue, person, etc.  Also, don‚Äôt hold your breath on the current administration, FB, etc. self policing.
I agree. I care about issues. When candidates agree with me on issues, I'm happy. When they don't, I'm not. And I can like candidates on some issues and not on others without vilifying the candidate. I'm frustrated with my US Rep right now because she doesn't support the green new deal or impeachment and refused to stand with us on closing the concentration camps. But if she doesn't get a primary challenger, I'm voting for her all the way.  I feel like I'm constantly being pinched. Moderates don't like that I criticize her. Others think I shouldn't vote for someone who doesn't share my values. I just recognize that she's easier to convince on issues than her Republican opponent and hope we can get enough people fired up to convince her.
Yeah, she's the only Democrat I don't want to win the primary because that point it's 4 more years of a Putin Administration, basically.  Here's NBC reporting on how the Russian propaganda machine is backing her https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/russia-s-propaganda-machine-discovers-2020-democratic-candidate-tulsi-gabbard-n964261  This one's from 3 days ago, she apparently doubts that Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, even though literally everyone says otherwise and there's plenty of evidence of it, even the person she cites as the source of her doubts has come out saying it was Assad... https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tulsi-gabbard-russia-syria-skripal-mh17-douma-airstrikes-a9040536.html
Actually I considered her one of the overperformers at that debate, as did my republican brother who was watching with me. I didn‚Äôt think she ‚Äúwon‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt think anyone else did either. So I would rank her as one of the winners by virtue of improving her image, just as I would consider Biden a winner by not taking any major damage.
I think the trouble with her are the red flags that are raised with the whole Syria situation. I don‚Äôt want to say she‚Äôs a Russian plant, but her stances here are EXTREMELY sketchy given the facts. I also believe she was at an RT dinner or something, which is not a good look.   https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tulsi-gabbard-russia-syria-skripal-mh17-douma-airstrikes-a9040536.html
I love you both
 Just saying, I was right.
Fair enough, just wish we had a chance to win the senate, and I think hes texas's best shot
Worth noting that 2022 is literally the only year in the 2020s where a governor could win and have zero say in gerrymandering XD. Too late to affect the 2020s, 2nd term would end before gerrymandering the 2030s. Although I agree with the spirit of your comment ;). And he could win a third term, pass laws about it, do other important gov things etc. etc.
Warren + Pete would appeal almost exclusively to white voters. I like Pete, but he'd complement Harris better than Warren.
Fun game: once we start down that road, where do we stop? Romney, no problem - he probably doesn‚Äôt actively want the country to come to any real harm.  McConnell or Pence, nope - too far over my line. Almost anyone and most house plants would be preferable to the current occupant, but once we head down the list of republicans, exactly where is that line? Graham? Cheney? Bolton? Scary, but relative to trump? When I think about the nuclear football I try to decide which is scarier: the risk of trump blowing up the world through incompetence or Cheney doing it on purpose.

Thank you for participating in constructive campaigning! Yes, we need collaboration. Warren and Bernie were the winners of the debate by working together to defend progressivism from radical centrists.

I'm both a Bernie and a Warren supporter, and for what it's worth, most of my progressive friends feel the same way.  While as an individual, I prefer Bernie to Warren, I will readily admit that I think Warren could very well be the consensus candidate that we desperately need in the general election.  As a Hoosier, my primary will not occur until May, and I plan to give my vote to whomever of the two progressives is closest to clinching the nomination.
Yep, unfortunately they don't take kindly to our optimistic outlook. It's a damn shame because Bernie rocks and I still love him. I just can't see how they will possibly build anything good from their toxic fanbase. I was a huge fan in 2016 and loved everything about it until the end when it became consistent attacks on Hillary Clinton and they took the bait on the email thing.  That's why I've come to stick with Warren, because we have the same values and policies, but without all the negativity. This allows coalitions to form (like bringing in Beto fans, as well).  I think there are a LOT more people out there that supported Bernie that are aware of the dangers that come with attacking people from the same party. Though, I gotta say, some of it is warranted and authentic -- like Biden's record and actions.
OH nonono XD. I see them trashing Warren more than anyone in their subs.  They seem to see her as the biggest threat to Bernie-ism because she will supposedly enervate the movement by only accomplishing half his revolution. Which is extremely ironic because a) that is word-for-word why actual socialists mostly won't vote for Bernie, and b) Warren is much more liberal than Bernie is if you [give it an honest look](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElizabethWarren/comments/cjcguc/the_case_for_warren_from_the_left/).
It goes against the message of "Not me, us." Bernie is highlighting problems that need a mass movement to solve, but that doesn't need to be led by him exclusively.
Yeesh, might want to send them caller feedback. I should mention that Our Revolution has endorsed some great candidates who have won or narrowly lost tough races (Stacey Abrams, Tony Evers), but their record on federal races isn't good. I get that the media talks shit about Bernie too often, but critiquing how an activist group does electoral politics is important for taking down a well-oiled Republican machine, and Our Revolution hasn't stepped up their game.
One of my biggest issues with Bernie this time around is some of the people he's hired. Nina Turner, long time head of Our Revolution.. she's.. toxic she was the "VOTE JILL, HILLARY AND TRUMP ARE ALMOST NO DIFFERENT" camp in 2016 and Dave Sirota is just a pure political hitman with little allgience to anything beyond who's paying him at the moment. I like a lot of what he says but he displays the signs of liking Yesmen around sometimes.
OMG ELIZABETH WARREN HERSELF WAS LEGIT ON SNL JUST NOW
"I'm not dead, I'm just in the Senate."  Jeez, is she talking to us? lol
She knows how to deliver a punchline and stuck another knife or two in Bloomberg - gotta love this lady!
‚ÄúI was the dog.‚Äù
This was so cute! "Maybe I'll pull a New York Times and just endorse them both." I'm dying.

Senator Elizabeth Warren could not have found a BETTER way to let the world know she's OK after dropping out of the race for the Democratic Presidential nomination. It hasn't even been one week since Super Tuesday and Liz's decision to suspend her campaign and she found the strength, time and above all... sense of humor to "take to SNL!" Now that's pretty impressive and respectable.  You go Liz! Don't worry about "all those little girls because they are going to be just fine, and they will be looking up to you no matter if you get to be President one day or not. and they will do so simply out of respect for who you are; what you stand for and everything you've accomplished in your lifetime. Stay true your own political approach and beliefs.
I freaked out! That was great!
America really missed out  Goddamn I love her
AHHHH I'M SO EXCITED TO WATCH IT WHEN IT GOES ON YOUTUBE. GOOD FOR HER!
This was sublime.  I am not crying you are.
For non-snl fans, full clips of the sketches usually start getting uploaded to YouTube by about 11pm PST, cold open will be among the first
It totally made my night! She was great! üíï
I just love her so much. She fights so hard for us and after all that abuse she took she still has such a positive attitude.
I had never seen Bailey DESTROYING that burrito. Didn‚Äôt think I could love that dog more
Anyone have the clip?

Glad to see she's keeping her spirits up! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Teachers, preschool teachers, teacher's pets.   This actually explains a lot about the vote totals, we split teacher's pets with Pete.
That was my favorite takeaway
Liz once again making us feel seen lol

I went to her store last night and bought a bunch of tshirts and a yard sign. I‚Äôm keeping it up next to my ‚Äúanyone but trump‚Äù sign until this campaign is over. As far as I‚Äôm concerned she‚Äôs still my candidate for president. She‚Äôs the goddamn bomb.
warren with no fucks left to give is my favorite warren.
Perfect answer!
She‚Äôs amazing. She is my personal Dumbledore.
Oh, I let it all out. Again.
I managed to laugh, cry, and laugh while crying at the end. Totally needed this.
I just want to start prank calling big banks now
I can't stop watching this. I have no words, but I love it.
üòÇ I cant
That's amazing üòç
Omg, she has white girl realness!
I was a train wreck all week and here is Liz being a champ and doing snl skits and Maddow interviews, time to pick myself up!
i'm so glad i checked SNL before reddit/twitter, i was wondering what they'd do about the state of the primary this week and when kate as laura said she'd have warren on i was expecting some pre-recorded split-screen shenanigans BUT THIS EXCEEDED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS! every line out of her mouth was FIRE and the "flip the switch" video SNL posted on twitter was the cherry on top. I LOVE HERRRR SOOOO FUCKING MUUUUUCCHHHHHHH
bailey is all of us eating our feelings right now (and eating billionaires)

It's the coronavirus cold open on the SNL YouTube channel
she MADE. KATE. BREAK. the only other person who can do that is cecily. the absolute STRENGTH of this woman, we don't deserve.
What is wrong with us that we can't elect a President with a goddamn sense of humor in this country???
I stopped to think a minute and this really does sum up why my fb feed was so pro-warren, lol. Lots of academics/college professors, and people who were top ten% of their class, lol.
Legit half the people I worked with were teachers, PhDs, and people with law degrees.
Hahahaha when she said teacher's pets, I died.  That's def where I fit in lol
i'm about to straight up buy one of those billionaire tears mugs for myself as a mother's day present
"If I can laugh *and pray* in 90 minutes, that is money well spent."  Sorry your comment just reminded me of the Tom Hanks Black Jeopardy sketch lol.
We could have had the HBIC in the oval office. Goddamit i wanna dance like Liz does.
Same I think my bf is over my dramatic statements and bouts of sadness. Thank god my bff understands. Its so upsetting to watch the best female candidate we've ever had get pushed aside. Keep on persisting Liz you at least started cracking that ultimate glass ceiling.
Making Kate McKinnon break? She's got a plan for that.
Same, I work in oncology research and both my workplace and social circle are overwhelmingly comprised of Warren voters.   A friend of mine said "Everyone we know voted for Warren. And no one else."
as a lifelong teacher's pet who was top 3% in my class, i feel seen and exposed.
Wife and I both have law degrees and we're both Warren supporters.
Because we're the ones that recognize she isn't just saying what she wants to do but also how. It boggles my mind that people don't get how huge that is.
Advanced degree here. Also love Warren
Right? I was like, nope not me, nope not me, oh there I am
america is terrified of HBICs.
if hillary made the first chips in the ultimate glass ceiling, i really thought warren would be the one to break through. i don't know who eventually will or how but i know they'll have warren to look back on say "that's my role model!"
I really need Warren Democrats to become a thing. My husband kinda gets it (in that he's impressed with her and knows that I idolize her) but I think he's starting to lose patience. But I have a friend I text with daily about it and we both have said thank God someone else understands.
Well, yeah, the nerds are gonna vote for the nerd ;)     \[nerd here\]
Another oncology specific healthcare worker- Warren is our champion. We love the cancer moonshot, and we know everyone needs healthcare. Warren‚Äôs plans for M4A really embraced our current reality with a path forward. She listened!
Me three. I follow or am friends with a bunch of romance novelists and fanfic writers, which are both groups where women with college and advanced degrees (especially academics and lawyers) are way over-represented compared to the general population. They broke overwhelmingly for Warren.
Hey, same here!
> i don't know who eventually will or how  Hopefully Warren four years from now! She is still young enough (apparently), and should be able to do better next cycle with lessons learned and Biden/Sanders out, who were the two titans of the two wings of the party.
i think it was around the time of the "omg warren so lame for dancing awkwardly, poser neeerrrrrrd" thing that i was like "when did this turn into revenge of the nerds and how is the bernie camp the jocks?"
i was not aware that romance novels/fanfics were such an overwhelmingly brainy demographic... does explain a lot about my younger years though >.>
Am I the only dumb dumb here?
Lol meanwhile I was laughing to my husband that she's so endearingly awkward. You can tell she's a wonk at heart, not a politician.
Stacey Abrams writes romance novels!
i got a degree in psychology that i can't use because i can't afford grad school, does that count as dumb?  actually it goes deeper than that. i got a degree in psychology because my passion was web design and i taught myself HTML & CSS in the late 90s but didn't know where to go from there and couldn't find a degree in web programming so i gave up. peak dumbdumb!
If you supported Warren, then no!
I'm a college drop out Warren stan  There's got be like, dozens of us!
I have an English degree so no.
Lol we‚Äôve got massive student debt. Dumb dumb is a relative term!
My grades where too bad to make college bc I had to take care of my sisters while my parents were abusing drugs. I was never a teacher's pet bc I used school to sleep. This whole thread is giving me a weird feeling of lost.
I‚Äôm gonna start putting that on my job application(note I didn‚Äôt say resume).
Hey, that doesn't make you dumb, though. I'm sorry that society failed all of you guys this way. I hope you get to build the life you want. I hope your sisters and parents are OK. And if you're a Warren person, you belong here, period. Liz wants to make things better for everyone.
oh man, that doesn't mean you're dumb! it means you were robbed of opportunity. :(
I'm so sorry you feel lost. I think you sound extraordinary.
Just remember guys, this is almost entirely a result of not having a good form of ranked-choice voting where we accurately probe and compile voter preferences. This is not the result of people not liking Liz‚Äôs approach.
Exactly. People keep saying "Warren's campaign did terribly, it's embarrassing she got so low" or whatever. But the % of votes that she got is not an indication of if people liked her or not. If the narrative that "this person can't win because they're too low in polls" takes over, it seems like that becomes the overwhelming strongest factor in if someone gets votes.  I maintain that ranked choice voting is the #1 most important thing because it's the step that will allow people to vote for candidates who want to push for important progressive changes.
There are 26 states that have some kind of direct initiative. Get [STV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI) on the ballot. It kills gerrymandering, too.
I going to fight for it the county convention.
Hey so I wasn't planning to participate, just read what was going on here. But I have to say this is something all democrats/progressives should be pushing for as a necessary change right along with healthcare and green energy.  This election, and all elections going forward, would be so much better with a ranked choice system. It would cause significantly less infighting between parties and candidates. We could all actually vote for our favourite without feeling like it was a waste.
And also mainly a result of Sexism  When you think back on this election, remember folks:   \* She was attacked by Trump surrogates over dumb shit   \* She was attacked by Bernie surrogates over dumb shit   \* People talked about her looks, her 'bossiness', her 'complaining'     Nevertheless, she will persist.
Ranked choice voting would have created a drastically different election. Small candidates like Williamson, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Yang, etc. would have been able to fare much better and actually had their ideas put out there and support viewed from a more accurate standpoint. Similarly, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù candidates like Klobuchar, Warren, Butteigeg, Harris, etc. would have been able to stay in as long as they liked and as long as they felt voters were connecting with them. We wouldn‚Äôt have needed this sloppy consolidation of votes that‚Äôs happened the last week and to totally f‚Äôd the entire race up
Amen. There were a few candidates I liked this cycle, and while I would have been willing to offer my support to many of them, I and others were forced to pick a single candidate at the expense of the others. Andrew Yang and Elizabeth Warren will be missed, but they're part of a larger movement in this country and that is NEVER going away.
Oh my god, think about how differently this mess of a primary would have gone with ranked choice voting!
Honest question-what is the difference between ranked choice voting and the nevada caucus where everyone puts down their top 3 candidate choices?
Join r/RankTheVote! It‚Äôs past time to get this done. Let‚Äôs make some memes and get ready for the next fight.
Ranked voting and required voting honestly should be a staple across countries. Australia has it and it has policies in place to allow for it. Voter turnout is what, 93%? and there‚Äôs no qualms about what candidate to vote for just because the person you like the most isn‚Äôt the front runner. Most other candidate supporters had Warren as a number two, but it didn‚Äôt matter because their vote solely counted for their candidate.   It created this super toxic division between similar campaigns because of ‚Äúsplitting the progressive vote‚Äù and I‚Äôm sick and tired of it.
100%  We need ranked choice or approval voting.
We need ranked choice voting yesterday.
If you live in Massachusetts, ranked-choice voting will be a ballot initiative this November. Please get involved!   [https://voterchoice2020.org](https://voterchoice2020.org)
My job, as I see it, is to make ranked choice or STAR a reality in my state. It needs to be a national priority too.  I think now I‚Äôd a good time to really build momentum since there are a lot of disappointed people from this primary.
And a lack of ranked choice would give us Biden over Sanders, then Trump over Biden.  There's also the optics of Warren, which were more damaging than the optics of Sanders, which are more damaging than the optics of Biden, which are somehow more damaging than the optics of Trump in a general election.  Incidentally, in ranked choice, the same person who votes that way might still vote Warren > Sanders > Biden > Trump and wind up with the exact opposite outcome, based on fear and a perception of others' voting behaviors,  People will vote against the progressive bloc, now, because there's an "angry gesticulating ~~Jewish~~ old guy with a weird accent".  Without ranked choice voting, people default to image/biases over policy/efficacy, which means progressivism always suffers.
Bernie supporter, and fellow progressive here.  Just want to say I stand with you in implementing ranked choice voting.
If we could all vote on the same day, she would have done so much better.  I love her and have donated a decent amount to her campaign despite being broke because I believe in her, but when everyone started dropping and endorsing Biden, it became clear that it wasn't going to work out for her. I switched to Bernie within 24 hours of voting on Super Tuesday, purely because I want a president with progressive values. I'd much rather it be her!   I really hope whoever is nominated brings her into his administration somewhere. She deserves it, and we deserve her intelligence somewhere in the White House.
Just a thought on this but isn't Iowa and Nevada's caucus a form of 'ranked choice' voting?  In that case Warren was frequently not viable in the first round which would means that her supporters would be the ones going to second choices...
Couldn't agree more. Liz was one of my top 3 throughout the campaign, and while I ended up favoring another candidate, I would easily have ranked her either 2 or 3 if given the choice. I was bummed with how things panned our for her, but I'm so hopeful she plays a role in whoever ends up kicking Trump's ass in November.
We need ranked choice. Warren was always my number two and if ranked voting was a thing she would‚Äôve had a lot more power.
Ranked Choice voting is such a necessity for democracy. I dream of a future where we don't have a 2 party system and Ranked choice is the first major step to take towards that. My condolences to all of you from a sanders supporter, I would be extremely distraught if the shoe was on the other foot. Sorry if any of you have faced nasty comments or remarks because of who you support.
Warren wouldn't have been my first choice but I would have been happy to mark her down as my second, Yang probably would have been my 3rd.  Hopefully ranked choice ballot initiative in California hits the required signature deadline by April 21st.  By the way I know the Bernie and Warren camps haven't always gotten along but I am sad to see the other actually progressive candidate to go. Solidarity forever ‚úä
Warren went from my #1 to my #2 because of her stance on fracking, but I always loved how her main interest was income inequality and making the economy work for everyone. The CFPB was an incredible accomplishment that proved she had the bite to back up her bark.  I'm sad that the representative for progressive policy in this country doesn't have Warren's pragmatism or intellectual rigor on policy. "I have a plan for that" was always the thing I admired most about her. I may disagree with her on policy or implementation, but I never doubted her opinions weren't well-informed and born from compassion and duty to others.
I doubt people don‚Äôt like Warren.... in terms of likability, feeling of approachable, she is absolutely the best. Problem is people now days wants everything dialed up to over 100....that‚Äôs how you get attention,....look at trump....  Vote Nov!!! The fight is not over.

IRV/RCV can be bad - it's better than FPTP but imo if we promote a voting system we should promote the right one. [Personally I'm partial to Ranked Pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs)  Anyways, for why IRV can be bad, take a lookie [at my writeup here](https://np.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/f82l4w/why_progressive_burlington_vermont_went_running/). It's about Burlington, VT, a progressive city which actually switched *from IRV/RCV to FPTP* because it fucked up one of their elections  Basically it allows candidates who "shouldn't" win to win by getting a weaker opponent
YES YES YES! WE NEED A RANK CHOICE VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY! TALK TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW AND MAKE SURE THEY KNOW HOW GREAT IT COULD BE!  JOIN r/RankTheVote
YES! 100% this. This is so important, I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not discussed widely and loudly enough.
Even with ranked choice voting she would have struggled.  In Iowa Bernie and Pete beat her so she wouldn‚Äôt have got any of their voters second preferences.  I don‚Äôt think she would have got enough of klobachar and Biden‚Äôs votes to surge to second.    Same thing with NH the only person she beat with a decent share was joe and with 100% of his votes she wouldn‚Äôt have had enough to surpass klobachar.    Same with Nevada and South Carolina.   RCV doesn‚Äôt take into account the second choices of winning candidates.  Which is a good thing.  Otherwise the libertarian candidate would basically always win because most dems and reps would put them second.  Unless there is some other system that accounts for this??
I might be wrong about this since I only heard about it in a speech that was a while back, but doesn‚Äôt ranked choice voting cause some form of voter disenfranchisement along minorities and/or less educated because the process is more convoluted? I‚Äôm all for reforming the voting system, as I realize now how badly I was wrong about some candidates, but I‚Äôm not sure ranked choice is the other if it means immigrants will have less of a say.
I think that RCV is something that everyone, not just Democrats would want to get behind. I hope whoever the democratic nominee is pushes it.
Approval voting in particular would be ideal for a primary.
It does seem that ranked voter is a good way to gauge which candidates are the unity candidates and which are the polarizing ones.
There was an Oakland mayor who won a few years ago because everyone ranked her their second choice candidate. There was unity in that. Liz was a lot of people's second choice. I strongly believe that. Speaking to volunteers who called voters all over the country, a lot of people said some variation of "Well, I do like her policy positions but I am voting for _____ because I don't think she can win." Which is...!
Bernie was most people‚Äôs second choice during exit polling. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  I agree that ranked choice voting reliably delivers results that most people can be happy with.
Ranked Choice voting would be stupid with the current state delegate system.  The current system actually isn't the worst, I think they just need to get rid of the 15% threshold and just delegate the delegates proportionally. If by the first round they don't get a majority, some delegates are allowed to switch etc.  This in essense is ranked choice voting or sorts but gives the power to the delegates.  RCV for states won't work.     Edit: the dolts downvoting me, explain why I'm wrong.
"we didn't loose. it was some other circumstances. in reality, everybody loved us but the establishment/the system/aliens made it impossible"
I don‚Äôt want it because it will allow for changes I want. I want it because it more accurately reflects voter preferences.
If you live in Massachusetts, ranked-choice voting will be a ballot initiative this November. Please get involved!  [https://voterchoice2020.org](https://voterchoice2020.org/)
For sure, she was the second choice by a large margin for Sanders supporters. As the only two progressive candidates it's obvious there would be a significant overlap in policies they're fighting for, just slightly different execution.
There were so many candidates in the race. She did STELLAR in comparison to the other 20+ candidates that did not last as long as her.  Ranked voting would have definitely helped her.
And join r/RankTheVote. Let's organize and finally get this thing done.
There's one issue that comes up right away with CGPG's example.  In that last example with white tiger, he's making the assumption that all second choice votes go to purple tiger, but in a more likely scenario, what if they're split between 2+ candidates. How do you decide which votes get transferred and which ones don't? If it's a cutoff at 33%, well, then now you have an incentive to hold off on voting as long as possible rather than vote early.  What might make more sense is that same example, but we use parties instead of individuals. The primary process is figuring out the order of those individuals. So with the CGPG's example, the tiger party got 2 delegates. White tiger is first on the list, then purple tiger. Gorilla party got 1 delegate and green gorilla was top of the list so he becomes the delegate.
The problem is that most implementations and proposals for ranked-choice voting systems aren‚Äôt good forms. In a sense, that‚Äôs more damaging than taking a bit of extra time to get it right the first time.
Just make sure that you advertise specifically a ‚Äúgood‚Äù ranked-choice voting system. There are many different types, some of which are better than others. The type that Maine and NYC implemented, while seeming good and simple on the surface, are actually hardly better than the crap we have now. There‚Äôs no perfect voting system, but blowing our wad on a bad one would be so much worse than leaving our current system slightly longer to make sure we implement the right one. We all know that changing anything like this is incredibly difficult, so it‚Äôs crucial that it be done right the first time if at all possible.
Yes! And join us at r/RankTheVote. It‚Äôs tiny but we‚Äôre growing really quickly over the past few days.
Yup, it‚Äôs a no-brainer
I thought for a while that publicly funded elections and getting money out of the election process was the answer to the perverse incentives of our current system. But I‚Äôm coming around to ranked choice as a dark horse way to get the other things accomplished.
[And she was attacked by Pete and his campaign](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/06/elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg-hostilities-077076). [Klobuchar attacked Warren.](https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/10/21/lead-jeff-zeleny-dnt-4p-live-jake-tapper.cnn) Klobuchar Pete and Klobuchar attacked each other and Biden, yet then all coalesced around Biden. And Warren attacked all of them as well, including Sanders (on dumb shit). Everyone attacked each other, except maybe Steyer who just wanted to shake candidates hands.   Unfortunately when you have this form of politics via quick ads and a "debate" stage designed for sound bites, this is the result. The only way to distinguish yourself is to attack each other, and no single candidate is not guilty of that. Recall how chummy Sanders and Warren were early on in the race, and then it gradually heated up. Both of them played the game of politics, like it or not.  While I don't doubt there's sexism at play (look at how smooth Pete had it as a young mayor of a small city, vs. Klobuchar as a Senator), I think it's far fetched to say it was the main driving force. Rather it's the system that promote these types of party infighting.  Ranked choice primaries would put progressives in a much better position and it would decrease intra party attacks. But, the moderates/establishment DNC don't like that first part, which is why you won't see it happen.
Yes, but that‚Äôs not something that be changed with the flip of a switch. That has to come over through making necessary  structural changes that allows for people‚Äôs lives to generally be better.
Every candidate was attacked by every other candidate for dumb shit.  The racism that's at play, imo, is way deeper than this. It's systemically ingrained into our culture. While it's easy to look at Warren's experience, and Clinton's for that matter, as an indication of overt sexism, I think it's worth noting as well that the mere fact both were legit candidates suggests things are at least changing for the better. It may be slower than we'd prefer, indeed, but pinning this all on sexism is weak.
[removed]
Pretty much. It‚Äôs a no-brainer to me.
Biden would also be near last place still.
It wouldn‚Äôt have been a mess essentially
The Nevada caucus uses RCV as early vote ballot - which in this cycle constituted almost half of the votes if I remember correctly, in which case they might as well make it a primary.   You're right, the Nevada method should be used by all the states. It removes any concerns regarding electability because if your first choice is eliminated, your vote will just go to your second choice. No votes are wasted.
That was only for early voting on NV.
I‚Äôm not familiar with how that early voting in the Nevada caucus worked, but making a ranked list alone is not a specific type of voting system and caucuses in general are garbage-poop. When constructing a voting system, you have to think about both how voters are to express their preferences (like via one-person;one vote, a ranked list, a head-to-head grid, etc.) *and* how you compile those votes expressions in order to determine a winner (take a look at wikipedia‚Äôs articles on ranked-choice voting, the Condorcet Criterion, and the Schulze Method as they‚Äôre really interesting) since there are actually many different methods for determining a winner given the same set of votes, where there‚Äôs fundamentally no perfect method in most cases (and none in the general case of not knowing what the votes are).
the difference is that it was handing delegates out proportionally instead of having one winner.  It let you rank your choices so that if youre candidate went below 15%, then you could pass on your vote to a viable candidate.  but once all the remaining candidates had 15% or more, they would split the vote proportionally. This is not a bad idea for a primary vote that is going state by state and handing delegates out proportionally, instead of winner take all.  say for a presidential vote. there is only one winner. and so if we ranked choice it, the criteria for your vote being passed to someone else isnt just that they didnt hit 15%, but rather that they are the last one standing.
Just to clarify RCV probably wouldn‚Äôt have helped warren that much.  In Iowa Pete and Bernie beat her so she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get their second preferences; you only get the second preferences of candidates that did worse then you.  Same thing with the other states.  Finishing 4th to 5th really isn‚Äôt high enough to benefit from RCV.  It would mean a few people voting strategically for other candidates would go to her but that still wouldn‚Äôt be enough.  In Australia we also have single transferable voting in the senate which allows parties who are spread out evenly geographically to get a say.  Basically you vote for the party and there are multiple winners.  So if the republicans got 35%, democrats 48% and libertarians 17% you would get 2 republican senators, 3 democrats and a libertarian.  It means getting a large percentage of the vote is favoured more then getting a few thousand swing voters as 2 parties each with 33% and 36 percent would probably get the same number of seats.  It also allows my state which is the most conservative to have a green senator.  RCV still results in 2 parties 90% of the time even when more then 10% of people vote third party in the house of reps.  RCV is a step up but it still doesn‚Äôt result in something representative.  And yeah, compulsory voting is great.  It really encourages whoever is in power to make it as easy and painless as possible as you don‚Äôt want people in a bad mood when they are forced to vote.  3 hour waits on a Tuesday would be unthinkable in Australia.  We still end up with right wing nutters but at least they are representative right wing nutters.  It really surprised me that so few countries have compulsory voting.
That‚Äôs an IRV system, which would be pretty bad. It can argued that it‚Äôs worse to push for and implement a bad ranked-choice voting system than leaving what we have a bit longer so that we can implement the right one.
Doing the same here in mine and spreading the idea to people frustrated with the primary online.
Not STAR. Schulze or ranked pairs.
I don‚Äôt want a good ranked-choice voting system for ‚Äúprogressivism‚Äú to win. I want it because it results in outcomes that more accurately reflect voter preferences.
Tbh any candidate who doesn't want to implement this is in my "too establishment" cutoff. Progressives suffer the most from this.
Isn‚Äôt he the only candidate who‚Äôs talked about it? I can‚Äôt remember anyone else bringing it up.
I think having everyone vote on the same day isn‚Äôt a crucial stipulation because it limits the amount of fundraising the eventual candidate would have. If we implemented a good form of ranked-choice voting (emphasis on the ‚Äúgood‚Äú) and accompanied that with a complementary change to how we compile the votes to choose the winner (delegates shouldn‚Äôt need to be a thing because a good ranked-choice voting system should be able to have the ‚Äúrun-off‚Äú results essentially built-in in the first place), then I think we can get away with having primaries be on a few separate days.
There are many different forms of ranked-choice voting. The caucuses, in addition to being terrible for other reasons, use a really bad form of ranked-choice voting.
Yes but it‚Äôs important to remember that that is not a good reason for wanting ranked-choice. It should be because it more accurately represents voter preferences, not because it may result more frequently in what you personally want.
You should be distraught as well. With all the horseshit over the last few days, Bernie has very slim odds of winning.
I we had the Schulze method, I probably would have done something like:  1 _ Yang 2 _ Warren 2 _ Booker 3 _ Bernie 4 _ Pete 5 _ Klobuchar 5 _ Biden  Edit: Godsdammit Reddit, messing up my formatting. You‚Äôre clearly not Schulze-friendly.

You‚Äôre absolutely right, which is why I specified a ‚Äúgood‚Äú form of ranked-choice voting that accurately probes and compiles voter preferences. I replied to a lot of comments explaining what I meant by this. I would be more partial to the Schulze method as it‚Äôs more focused on finding the best winner rather than the best ranking order of everyone (as in the ranked pairs method). At the very least, I would want a method that fulfills the Smith criterion, which both Schulze and ranked pairs do. Ranked pairs requires a more complex ballot IIRC, which could cause major issues for the general population being dumb.
It is more and more now, like an explosion of talking about it. The big problem with that is that a lot of people who don‚Äôt understand the many intricacies (and I mean *many*) of ranked-choice voting will make it so that if we do start implementing them more, they‚Äôll be bad forms of it (like the IRV systems that Maine and New York City just implemented).
Yeah, so ranked-choice voting is a very broad family of voting systems. There are many different types, but for an election like this, the Schulze method and pairwise comparison method are two Condorcet and Smith-complete methods that people tend to like. There‚Äôs no constructable perfect voting system though.
It doesn‚Äôt have to be confusing at all. It can be simple enough such that anyone who should reasonably be able to vote can understand it just fine.
That was a large part of what Yang was pushing for. He had the best ideas of anyone. It‚Äôs a real shame he was so shut out.
Sure, but the Schulze or ranked pairs methods would be much better
Can you guys give us one day to mourn? Just one day?
But that‚Äôs already following up on so much that would be different if we had a proper voting system. You can‚Äôt use that and come to any meaningful conclusions.
Ranked choice voting allows more people to participate because it can be done by mail-in ballot. It does not require people to lose a whole day of work nor wait for long hours. It allows people to vote early if mail-in, with a paper trail, while also maintaining voting power of a candidate drops out before the election. What is it that you see in caucuses that overrides participation, convenience, and accuracy?
I would prefer voters to have the power directly, rather than through delegates at a convention.
I agree on the point about the threshold. I understand it‚Äôs purpose, but it really should have been lowered for a larger field. 5% perhaps. I‚Äôm not sure how anyone could defend what happened with the thresholds and also defend the electoral college.
I said that in my post comment (or at least tried to say it lol)
That‚Äôs... not what I said...

Personally I find the way people treat presidential candidates who don't win to be really awful. People act like it's the most embarrassing thing in the world to get any position other than 1st. "What, you *only* got 15% voters to want you to be president of the United states? Shameful." Hell they think it's embarrassing if you get 2nd, anything other than 1st.
I'm in.
Well, he's giving a simplistic view of things for the sake of explanation. The math behind it is not that simple.  I'm guessing, but I would think you would take all of White Tiger's votes and see what percentage of all second place votes are for that candidate. Then take the extra votes and allocate them by that percentage. -- Did that also solve the problem you were expressing?  Your way (party vote) might work well as well.
True, but even STV is a major improvement from where we are now, so it's still worth fighting for IMO.
What is wrong with STV from an implementation standpoint? Are you saying that other countries and counties and cities that use ranked-choice are all doing it wrong and it's worse than first past the post for representation selection?  And it's not about taking extra time. Warren first voters voted for Bernie and Biden because they desperately didn't want the other one in that binary, instead of voting for Warren.  At this point, you've made an assertion with no data to back it up. And I'm surprised since you are also OP who seemed to be championing the idea of ranked-choice.
Which one should I fight for then?
As an Australian, you're sadly mistaken about this push for a "good" type.  Being Condorcet perfect is very overrated, precisely because to do so requires you to compromise on a bunch of other things. In standard IRV the situations where problems come up strongly tend to be quite odd.  The alternatives people are commonly pushing, like approval voting, the schulze or giving candidates a rating, tend to be vulnerable to strategic voting, vulnerable to hyperpartisanship, or extremely difficult to count..  Stuff like the Maine system has the benefit of being able to be easily calculated by hand, and voters can follow how it works, which is really really important because its so easy for people to stir up paranoia against RCV.   >are actually hardly better than the crap we have now  Absurd. It pretty much fixes the third party support problem. As someone who has watched RCV fail around the world again, and again and again, Anti-paranoia is really one of the most important criteria and here you are spreading Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt about the current method that is getting implemented.   You don't want to be transitioning to computer either, due to security concerns, which would ease the counting for the .  The  Schulze Method is fine for a few candidates, but since all possible permutations have to be recorded, it exponentially increases in count complexity at a rate of n! or more, which starts to get overwhelming and increase chances of volunteer mistakes. Again you may say this is fine, we'll just take our time, which I think is irresponsible when it starts adding up but...  But I can tell you as someone who has lived in a RCV system with some complex elements that as the counting process happens with no numbers on election night, or only simple numbers, that paranoia and lack of faith that sinks a RCV system starts to rise.   Hell if I was an establishment powerbroker determined to sink a schulze RCV, I would ensure that a race was filled with lots of candidates... you know, kind of like the race we just had?
Is it possible for a Bernie supporter to see a comment that mentions Bernie people attacking others without engaging in disingenuous whataboutism and pretending the other campaigns had even remotely as big of a problem with toxicity? I feel like it may be impossible, you‚Äôll start twitching uncontrollably and won‚Äôt be able to sleep for a week. You‚Äôll go crazy knowing you saw someone point out that the guy you support has a lot of shithead followers without trying to downplay the issue.  How have you all not recognized that pretending it‚Äôs not an issue pisses people off almost as much as the toxicity itself? The fact that you all have tried to create internet bubbles where you drown out any criticism of Bernie or his movement and only allow positive news about him to exist has led to you convincing yourselves that those bubbles are real life. Instead all it‚Äôs done is piss off anyone who isn‚Äôt 100% pro Bernie and pushed them to just leave those spaces instead of playing along with you all.  You undoubtedly want Warren to support Bernie. Warren and her supporters have been attacked in often disgusting ways for some time now and those attacks are 99% from Bernie supporters. Ask any Warren supporter who isn‚Äôt trying to boost Bernie as well which campaign has been toxic and vicious to them and they will all say Bernie‚Äôs. And you know that‚Äôs the case despite any whataboutism you engage in. Dismissing legitimate grievances her supporters have really just pisses them off even further and reinforces the idea that Bernie and his campaign feel entitled to their support and will refuse to allay any of their concerns.   This strategy of arguing that none of the criticisms of Bernie or his supporters are legitimate is a bad one, it would be hard for to believe it‚Äôs actually helped convince more than a handful of people to support Bernie. On the other hand it definitely pisses a lot of people off. If your goal is to try and convince yourself that Bernie and his campaign are infallible then go ahead and stick with what you‚Äôre doing. But if you want to get other candidate‚Äôs supporters to back Bernie then I‚Äôd suggest listening to what they have to say and try to help them feel comfortable joining your movement.
And yet Americans were able to vote for a black man for president but could not bring themselves to elect a woman? I am pinning this on sexism, sexism that I see every day, and if that means I'm weak then so be it.
I think everyone would appreciate it if you guys would just leave us alone for one day
That‚Äôs only in a bad ranked-choice system. The Schulze method, for example, works differently and is much better.
Met future president Warren last night at Des Moines watch party!
And it was the best night of my life! I have been in Warren‚Äôs corner since the whole Wells Fargo issue in 2016. Have been all in on Warren since she announced running for president, proudly caucused for her last night and was sitting on my couch at 10 pm watching her give her speech on CNN when it hit me, I NEED TO GO SEE HER! It was a 10 minute drive from my house, got there right at the end of her speech. I was interviewed by Washington Examiner, TIME and associated press and made my way to Elizabeth herself! I squealed her name, got a big hug and multiple photos of the whole thing playing out. I didn‚Äôt get home until midnight, was up until 2 am and just couldn‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm so high on life right now! She was exactly as you see her, no surprises meeting her in person. NOW COME ON IOWA CAUCUS GIVE US THE NUMBERS!!!!
[deleted]
So lucky to have met our first female President!
That had to be so awesome!
So much love! Warren beat Biden and all expectations to finish in a dead heat for the top 3. Thank you for all you did in Iowa!
This is awesome! I hope to meet her soon too!
Great Pic! Thanks for sharing!
I had to google that üòÇ They took multiple pictures from beginning of walking up to her to this final picture, I was NOT shy haha! It was like seeing an old friend
What are the odds she even gets through the primaries? Slim at best. Then she'd hypothetically if somehow got that neat the president who is surging to record high approval.   Not to poo poo your optimism but c'mon
I hope you do too! I felt like I had known her forever, she‚Äôs so personable!
Absolutely!! Gonna ride this high for awhile ‚úäüèªüá∫üá∏

Oh figured you knew that, almost every news source is covering it, what's your go to most trustworthy site?  https://www.salon.com/2020/02/04/donald-trumps-approval-rating-hits-record-high-in-new-poll/  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/02/04/trump-approval-hits-new-high-in-gallup-poll-despite-impeachment.html  https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-just-earned-his-highest-approval-rating-ever-amid-impeachment-2020-2  Its cause of this impeachment thing.
Sorry for the interest in an election that would either destroy my country through proxy or see it continue to prosper ....   Also, way to address the points. I get that you may not want to be polite back, that's fine, but maybe consider actually tailoring responses to some semblance of facts / reality.
Yeah, he's a Canadian Trump lover.  Always good to make them back up their idiocy with data.  Rarely works though
But that's not a record approval rating.  Its a record high for Trump, its lower than every other President's peak. Pathetically low, to be honest.    Trump Peak approval: 49%  Obama peak approval:  69%  W Bush Peak approval: 90%  Clinton Peak approval: 73%  HW Bush Peak approval: 89%  Regan Peak approval: 71%  Nixon  Peak approval: 66%  Johnson Peak approval: 79%  Kennedy Peak approval: 83%  Eisenhower Peak approval: 77%  Truman Peak approval: 87%  FDR Peak approval: 83%  generally not taken before FDR  &#x200B;     Source below, nice handy chart for ya   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_presidential\_approval\_rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating)   Your boy has an embarrassing peak approval rating and it is in no way a record for a US President.
His peak is not as high as other presidents peak, that's true. You're fully entitled to you opinion in terms of it being "pathetic", diverse opinions make the world beautiful. Just in case you were wondering where my opinion comes from, if you weren't that's fine, but it's a) interesting that since the democratic impeachment, it's gone up relative to where it was. and even more importantly b) he won the presidency at 41% so being at 49% no he would absolutely demolish whoever he ran against. I was speaking more about in terms of re-electability, I totally get that maybe you don't care about that and are more interested in other metrics, which is perfectly fine.
A record is a fact, not an opinion. The fact that you can‚Äôt tell the difference between the two is exactly why you‚Äôre a Trump supporter.  We can see your post history dude
OMG it's at -180 now for Trumo. What I thought was the surge was like a pre surge surge for a much bigger surge.   Warren plummeted to +4000, wow. I got Mike when he first announced at +2500 now he's at +750. Warren at one point was a favourite close to Biden. All democrats pretty big long shots.   What I find super interesting is Warren is even behind Andrew Yang .... wow, I didn't think she'd fall that fast in popularity and likelihood. Releasing the numbers for her big plan similar to Bernie killed her, not realistic. If Bernie ever talked about numbers like Elizabeth Warren did, he'd be gone too. He needs to try and change the topic for a chance, cant make it be actually analyzed.
I think you misread, totally fine, I do that too sometimes.   If you re read my statement you'll see that I wrote "You're fully entitled to your opinion in terms of it (the numbers) being "pathetic"" Some added explanation: I am commenting on your view that the numbers which would get him elected are "pathetic". Not the numbers themselves.   You are totally 100% correct the numbers are a fact, not an opinion, it's the subjective view on those numbers, that isn't a "fact" and is an opinion. Your view that they are pathetic which is the opinion, to clarify. Some person may look at the comparable Elizabeth warren favourability numbers and see that they are at 39%-40% and say those are terrific, she is doing great woohoo, you go girl! Others may look at them and think that 9-10% worse than Trump is absolutely embarrassing. Each opinion is subjective, and valid, but you're right the numbers are correct as far as we know.  I do appreciate you getting back to me though, taking the time out of your day to do so. Take care, and I wish you the absolute best, I fully respect you regardless of us seeing things not the exact same way.   https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/elizabeth_warren_favorableunfavorable-6675.html
Warren becomes fastest first-time presidential candidate to hit 3 million donations
I make my measly donation every paycheck. Lol.
That's amazing.  In talking about this race people don't mention enough how impossibly hard it is to run in a crowded field where *two* candidates have run before, are front runners from the jump.   It's not surprising that people like Booker and Harris and others never really got a foot in the door. Voters have limited bandwidth. And meanwhile, in the last three months, you've had not only those two front runners but also two billionaires outspending the field a hundred times over. And you're stuck in DC because of impeachment. And you're foregoing big dollar donors.   It's a crazy achievement. What a campaign she has run.  You also have to credit Mayor Pete for rising from 0 name-ID to a contender. He has certain advantages, including his big-dollar fundraisers, but what he has done, in the context of a race that began with two front runners with 100% name-ID is very impressive too.  Anyway, amazing achievement by Team Warren.
Go Liz Go!  I have made two contributions lately. I want a call dammit.
It feels incredibly powerful to be able to say I contributed to that.
Bernie supporter here. Just want to say congratulations to ya'll. :)  Go Team Progressive, go!
Soon to be the fastest president to get 3 million donations.
Good for her! I just chipped in another $50.
Looks like I‚Äôll be donating again!
She deserves it. Just made a contribution!
That‚Äôs pretty amazing. Definitely gives some grassroots cred to brag about!
Why is this thread so downvoted? Like who does it hurt that she‚Äôs had this success?
Woo hoo! Keep it up guys, don't feel discouraged by all the noise. Focus on the goal! üëä
And all that without selling out to big money fundraisers!
Nice, progressives are killing it this cycle! Hope this new fundraising method (i.e., from the people directly) sticks

This feels like a very cherry picked stat
[removed]
I believe Warren launched her campaign on Feb 9th, 2019. While Bernie launched his 2016 campaign on April 30th. That‚Äôs a difference of about 2 months and 3 weeks. She probably did it at the earliest point in campaigning history given her earlier launch, but probably not the ‚Äúfastest‚Äù.
Nothing you do is measly, Carol! :)
Same here, my wife and I donate a little bit each month to Warren and Bernie.
Cough Yang cough
I've been listening to 538's podcast on the primary system in the U.S.  I thought the way the system worked was a mess, but the more I learned the more I agree with the the idea of a closed selection system. Then again I am also in Europe and explaining how we do things in the U.S. all the time. Folks are like that is bonkers, and I am like yep it is.
Ask how Bernie ran in 2016 up against the entire democratic party. She could have ran back then. She made it extra difficult for herself running in 2020 especially after all the support he gained since 2016. Not to mention Biden jumping in as well. I wouldn't care very much for the 2 billionaires though.
Sick flair! Go Team Progressive!!
Much appreciated!
Upset I can‚Äôt upvote this multiple times.
Sorry to be pedantic but, even if she becomes president, it can't be assumed that figure would be accurate.
Good idea! Maybe we can get to 4 million before Super Tuesday?
I think it's pretty obvious. Quite pathetic.
But it's important. It means that when Sanders ran the first time, he didn't get there as fast.
Very sensitive about a cherry picked stat. I‚Äôm  the first 5‚Äô6 Hispanic American male to ever graduate with a 3.46 GPA and drive a Red Honda to comment on this post
And *this* feels like a trolling comment (reported).  Edit: this user's post history suggests they aren't for Warren--including belonging to a pro-Trump sub--and this sub has dealt with endless brigading abuse; I don't see any reason to tolerate any more negativity towards her campaign when it doesn't seem the comment is coming from a genuine position.
He‚Äôs run for president before and Warren hasnt. In 2016, it took him 5 days longer to get to 3 million than Warren in 2020.   It‚Äôs a great achievement either way, can‚Äôt you celebrate it on its own?
You're getting downvoted because you didn't read the headline.
Especially treeting yoself.
Yea, I don't consider him to be really running for president so I didn't think of him, but he's def cut through and built something despite a lack of name ID in ways other people couldn't, which is awesome.
Yes, it is difficult. Which is why her achievement is that great! And quite frankly, most people here are happy she‚Äôs *running now*. 2016 happened. We‚Äôre looking at 2020.
Team Progressive... I like that!
I've got your back.
Oh I know. It‚Äôs just ridiculous watching it happen.
Come on man that isn‚Äôt trolling
How is this trolling?
Jeez you actually reported that comment? The hell is the matter with you?
The title is pretty self-explanatory, as are the points I made.
I think initially he wasn't, but given how far he has come he is definitely a serious contender at this point in time.
[removed]
Sanders supporter here, I upvoted this because I like to see Progressives energizing people :)
You don't think a negative comment from a pro-Trump redditor might be trolling?  Edit: your post history includes a pro-Trump sub and support for Yang; forgive me if I don't trust your intentions here.
I think around the 1st debate he shifted gears a bit and started thinking he could actually win. The funny part is he was at his least likeable/persuasive during that window (though he's always a very likeable guy). But subsequently he's been running like a principle candidate again - automation, UBI, engaging non-voters, talking about community issues that usually don't get mentioned on the stage, cheerleading the other candidates. But I don't think he's running to win. If he were, I think there's a few things he'd have done differently in the last four months.
I think UBI is potentially great. Super interesting. I don't at all think it's the panacea Yang does.  I similarly think automation is super interesting. I don't think it's the nightmare that Yang does.  But I like him a lot.  > Warren has been reading Yang‚Äôs book.  I have no doubt, she's a sponge for that stuff, genuinely curious and passionate, and a policy, economic, and legal genius. One of the reasons I think she's the best candidate by 100 miles.  > no two term senator has ever been elected president  First off, this isn't true. JFK, off the top of my head. In other words, not only would Warren not be the first two term Senator elected president, she wouldn't even be the first two-term Senator *from Massachusetts* elected president. And I'd bet he isn't alone.   Second, even if it were true, relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/1122/
Removed per Rule 11. Please don't proselytize other candidates here. We're happy to talk through similar plans and proposals, but actively campaigning for someone else isn't the point of this sub.
This is a weird thing to say, considering she's had the job for like 7 years; that's not what I would consider "career" or behind the times; it struck me as that point in a career when you really know the ropes.
Hey thanks for being awesome! So exciting to have two amazing progressive candidates kicking ass in the race.
Can you reel some of your friends in please? We're all very tired.
Yang is pretty awesome ? Not my favorite candidate but I like the guy. Also, so what if he‚Äôs been on a Trump sub. If the Democrats have that mentality , Republicans are going to win elections for a while. Just preaching to the choir is not going to get Democrats votes . You‚Äôre gonna have to try and convince some people who otherwise maybe open to progressive ideas ( not the racists or corrupt billionaires)
Go ahead and find some pro trump comments. Commenting in pro-trump subs=/Trump support. The irony is I‚Äôve been called out for trolling and reported in those trump subs.   Also even if the comment was from a pro-trump redditer, it shouldn‚Äôt matter. Attack the ideas not the person. This isn‚Äôt sports.
I think he‚Äôs achieved a good portion of his goal. UBI was discussed in a national debate and people are now talking about it. That‚Äôs a great achievement on its own
[removed]
Sanders supporter here. Unfortunately it's very easy for one bad actor to be destructive/manipulative online (especially with how easy it is to buy bot Reddit accounts). On our Texting Slack, there was someone impersonating a Staff member answering questions to erroneously throw out voter records. This kind of manipulation is happening to anyone who is challenging the status quo. Let's stay strong together!
It‚Äôs not that yang is bad, more about people who don‚Äôt support Warren coming here to to badmouth her or her supporters
Yea, I agree with that. He's been way more succesfull than even he anticipated.  I remember interviews with him in like 2018 where he was like "yea, I'm running for president" sheepishly and then like doing his pitch on UBI and automation. He's come a long way and done well and I think, assuming he doesn't do anything silly henceforth, to the extent that the win % against Trump has been impacted by his presence in the primary, the Dems are in a better position because he ran.
Removed for Rule 11.  Don't come to Warren's sub to talk about your favorite candidate and say she could be their VP.
They REALLY didn't like you saying that!
>Let's stay strong together!  Hell yeah! LFG!
That comment just said it was a cherry picked stat. That‚Äôs not bad mouthing . Again, if you can‚Äôt take just a comment about this statistic being cherry picked , how are you going to take Trump‚Äôs vicious attacks in the general?
I guess so... Or the the media ploy to pit the progressive candidates against each other was successful. Here's hoping for the former!
Is it a sub *about* or is it a sub that is strictly *for* Warren? I'm frankly surprised the commentary is still up after 4 hours.
It's about and for Warren. It's not strictly for, it's for Dems and even non-Dems to engage too, but we don't want folks coming here to proselytize other candidates either.   This isn't The\_Donald. We do want cogent analysis and constructive feedback so long as it doesn't go into "and that's why \[x\] candidate is better so come donate/phonebank/vote etc. for them!!!"
Thanks for not banning me
I understand that . I want Warren and her supporters to be as strong and as savvy as possible because we , as Democrats , are in for hell in the general . I considered Warren at one point . However, I understand that her supporters and I will have common cause once we have a nominee, no matter who wins the primary .
